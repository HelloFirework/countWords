Although unsupervised person re-identiﬁcation (RE-ID)
has drawn increasing research attentions due to its potential
to address the scalability problem of supervised RE-ID mod-
els, it is very challenging to learn discriminative information
in the absence of pairwise labels across disjoint camera
views. To overcome this problem, we propose a deep model
for the soft multilabel learning for unsupervised RE-ID. The
idea is to learn a soft multilabel (real-valued label likeli-
hood vector) for each unlabeled person by comparing the
unlabeled person with a set of known reference persons from
an auxiliary domain. We propose the soft multilabel-guided
hard negative mining to learn a discriminative embedding
for the unlabeled target domain by exploring the similarity
consistency of the visual features and the soft multilabel-
s of unlabeled target pairs. Since most target pairs are
cross-view pairs, we develop the cross-view consistent soft
multilabel learning to achieve the learning goal that the
soft multilabels are consistently good across different cam-
era views. To enable effecient soft multilabel learning, we
introduce the reference agent learning to represent each ref-
erence person by a reference agent in a joint embedding.
We evaluate our uniﬁed deep model on Market-1501 and
DukeMTMC-reID. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-
art unsupervised RE-ID methods by clear margins. Code is
available at https://github.com/KovenYu/MAR.

1. Introduction

Existing person re-identiﬁcation (RE-ID) works mostly
focus on supervised learning [17, 20, 58, 63, 1, 45, 51, 43,
38, 41, 33]. However, they need substantial pairwise labeled
data across every pair of camera views, limiting the scala-
bility to large-scale applications where only unlabeled data

is available due to the prohibitive manual efforts in exhaus-
tively labeling the pairwise RE-ID data [49]. To address
the scalability problem, some recent works focus on unsu-
pervised RE-ID by clustering on the target unlabelled data
[52, 53, 8] or transfering the knowledge from other labeled
source dataset [29, 48, 7, 62]. However, the performance is
still not satisfactory. The main reason is that, without the
pairwise label as learning guidence, it is very challenging
to discover the identity discriminative information due to
the drastic cross-view intra-person appearance variation [52]
and the high inter-person appearance similarity [60].

To address the problem of lacking pairwise label guidance
in unsupervised RE-ID, in this work we propose a novel soft
multilabel learning to mine the potential label information
in the unlabeled RE-ID data. The main idea is, for every
unlabeled person image in an unlabeled RE-ID dataset, we
learn a soft multilabel (i.e. a real-valued label likelihood
vector instead of a single pseudo label) by comparing this
unlabeled person with a set of reference persons from an
existing labeled auxiliary source dataset. Figure 1 illustrates
this soft multilabel concept.

Based on this soft multilabel learning concept, we pro-
pose to mine the potential discriminative information by the

2148

soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining, i.e. we lever-
age the soft multilabel to distinguish the visually similar
but different unlabeled persons. In essence, the soft multil-
abel represents the unlabelled target person by the reference
persons, and thus it encodes the relative comparative char-
acteristic of the unlabeled person, which is from a different
perspective than the absolute visual feature representation.
Intuitively, a pair of images of the same person should be
not only visually similar to each other (i.e. they should have
similar absolute visual features), but also equally similar to
any other reference person (i.e. they should also have sim-
ilar relative comparative characteristics with respect to the
reference persons). If this similarity consistency between the
absolute visual representation and the relative soft multilabel
representation is violated, i.e. the pair of images are visually
similar but their comparative characteristics are dissimilar, it
is probably a hard negative pair.

In the RE-ID context, most image pairs are cross-view
pairs which consist of two person images captured by differ-
ent camera views. Therefore, we propose to learn the soft
multilabels that are consistently good across different camera
views. We refer to this learning as the cross-view consistent
soft multilabel learning. To enable the efﬁcient soft multil-
abel learning which requires comparison between the unla-
beled persons and the reference persons, we introduce the
reference agent learning to represent each reference person
by a reference agent which resides in a joint feature embed-
ding with the unlabeled persons. Speciﬁcally, we develop
a uniﬁed deep model named deep soft multilabel reference
learning (MAR) which jointly formulates the soft multilabel-
guided hard negative mining, the cross-view consistent soft
multilabel learning and the reference agent learning.

We summarize our contributions as follows: (1). We ad-
dress the unsupervised RE-ID problem by a novel soft multi-
label reference learning method, in which we mine the poten-
tial label information latent in the unlabeled RE-ID data by
exploiting the auxiliary source dataset for reference compar-
ison. (2). We formulate a novel deep model named deep soft
multilabel reference learning (MAR). MAR enables simul-
taneously the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining,
the cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning and the
reference agent learning in a uniﬁed model. Experimental
results on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID show that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised RE-ID
methods by signiﬁcant margins.

2. Related Work

Unsupervised RE-ID. Unsupervised RE-ID refers to that
the target dataset is unlabelled but the auxiliary source
dataset is not necessarily unlabelled [29, 8, 48, 7, 62].
Existing methods either transfer source label knowledge
[29, 8, 48, 7, 62] or assuming strong prior knowledge (i.e.
either assuming the target RE-ID data has speciﬁc cluster

structure [52, 53, 8] or assuming the hand-crafted features
could be discriminative enough [52, 16, 15, 57, 9, 46]). Re-
cently attempts have been made on exploiting video tracklet
associations for unsupervised RE-ID [5, 19]. Another line of
work focusing on reducing the labelling effort is to minimize
the labelling budget on the target [32] which is complemen-
tary to the unsupervised RE-ID. The most related works
are the clustering-based models [52, 53, 8], e.g. Yu et.al.
[52, 53] proposed an asymmetric metric clustering to dis-
cover labels latent in the unlabelled target RE-ID data. The
main difference is that the soft multilabel could leverage
the auxiliary reference information other than visual feature
similarity, while the pseudo label only encodes the feature
similarity of an unlabelled pair. Hence, the soft multilabel
could mine the potential label information that cannot be
discovered by directly comparing the visual features.

Some unsupervised RE-ID works also proposed to use the
labeled source dataset by the unsupervised domain adapta-
tion [50, 7, 62, 48] to transfer the discriminative knowledge
from the auxiliary source domain. Our model is different
from them in that these models do not mine the discrimi-
native information in the unlabeled target domain, which is
very important because the transferred discriminative knowl-
edge might be less effective in the target domain due to the
domain shift [28] in discriminative visual clues.

Unsupervised domain adaptation. Our work is also close-
ly related to the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
[23, 39, 40, 36, 25, 42, 10, 24], which also has a source
dataset and an unlabeled target dataset. However, they are
mostly based on the assumption that the classes are the same
between both domains [3, 28, 6, 27], which does not hold in
the RE-ID context where the persons (classes) in the source
dataset are completely different from the persons in the tar-
get dataset, rendering these UDA models inapplicable to the
unsupervised RE-ID [50, 7, 62, 48].

Multilabel classiﬁcation. Our soft multilabel learning is
conceptually different from the multilabel classiﬁcation
[54]. The multilabel in the multilabel classiﬁcation [54] is a
groundtruth binary vector indicating whether an instance be-
longs to a set of classes, while our soft multilabel is learned
to represent an unlabeled target person by other different
reference persons. Hence, existing multilabel classiﬁcation
models are for a different purpose and thus not suitable to
model our idea.

Zero-shot learning. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to rec-
ognize novel testing classes speciﬁed by semantic attributes
but unseen during training [18, 31, 55, 14, 56]. Our soft
multilabel reference learning is related to ZSL in that every
unknown target person (unseen testing class) is represented
by a set of known reference persons (attributes of training
classes). However, the predeﬁned semantic attributes are not
available in unsupervised RE-ID. Nevertheless, the success

2149

of ZSL models validates/justiﬁes the effectiveness of rep-
resenting an unknown class (person) with a set of different
classes. A recent work also explores a similar idea by repre-
senting an unknown testing person in an ID regression space
which is formed by the known training persons [47], but it
requires substantial labeled persons from the target domain.

3. Deep Soft Multilabel Reference Learning

3.1. Problem formulation and Overview

We have an unlabeled target RE-ID dataset X = {xi}Nu
i=1
where each xi is an unlabeled person image collected in the
target visual surveillance scenario, and an auxiliary RE-ID
dataset Z = {zi, wi}Na
i=1 where each zi is a person image
with its label wi = 1, · · · , Np where Np is the number of the
reference persons. Note that the reference population is com-
pletely non-overlapping with the unlabeled target population
since it is collected from a different surveillance scenario
[50, 7, 62]. Our goal is to learn a soft multilabel function l(·)
such that y = l(x, Z) ∈ (0, 1)Np where all dimensions add
up to 1 and each dimension represents the label likelihood
w.r.t. a reference person. Simultaneously, we aim to learn a
discriminative deep feature embdding f (·) under the guid-
ance of the soft multilabels for the RE-ID task. Speciﬁcally,
we propose to leverage the soft multilabel for hard negative
mining, i.e. for visually similar pairs we determine they
are positive or hard negative by comparing their soft mul-
tilabels. We refer to this part as the Soft multilabel-guided
hard negative mining (Sec. 3.2). In the RE-ID context, most
pairs are cross-view pairs which consist of two person im-
ages captured by different camera views. Therefore, we
aim to learn the soft multilabels that are consistently good
across different camera views so that the soft multilabels
of the cross-view images are comparable. We refer to this
part as the Cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning
(Sec. 3.3). To effeciently compare each unlabeled person
x to all the reference persons, we introduce the reference
agent learning (Sec. 3.4), i.e. we learn a set of reference
agents {ai}Np
i=1 each of which represents a reference person
in the shared joint feature embedding where both the un-
labeled person f (x) and the agents {ai}Np
i=1 reside (so that
they are comparable). Therefore, we could learn the soft
multilabel y for x by comparing f (x) with the reference
agents {ai}Np
i=1, i.e. the soft multilabel function is simpliﬁed
to y = l(f (x), {ai}Np

i=1).

We show an overall illustration of our model in Fig-
ure 2.
In the following, we introduce our deep soft
multilabel reference learning (MAR). We ﬁrst introduce
the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining given the
reference agents {ai}Np
i=1 and the reference comparabili-
ty between f (x) and {ai}Np
i=1. To facilitate learning the
joint embedding, we enforce a unit norm constraint, i.e.

||f (·)||2 = 1, ||ai||2 = 1, ∀i, to learn a hypersphere embed-
ding [44, 22]. Note that in the hypersphere embedding, the
cosine similarity between a pair of features f (xi) and f (xj)
is simpliﬁed to their inner product f (xi)Tf (xj), and so as
for the reference agents.

3.2. Soft multilabel guided hard negative mining

Let us start by deﬁning the soft multilabel function. Since
each entry/dimension of the soft multilabel y represents
the label likelihood that adds up to 1, we deﬁne our soft
multilabel function as

y(k) = l(f (x), {ai}Np

i=1)(k) =

exp(aT

k f (x))

Σi exp(aT

i f (x))

(1)

where y(k) is the k-th entry of y.

It has been shown extensively that mining hard nega-
tives is more important in learning a discriminative em-
bedding than naively learning from all visual samples
[13, 37, 26, 35, 34]. We explore a soft multilabel-guided
hard negative mining, which focuses on the pairs of visually
similar but different persons and aims to distinguish them
with the guidance of their soft multilabels. Given that the
soft multilabel encodes relative comparative characteristics,
we explore a representation consistency: Besides the similar
absolute visual features, images of the same person should
also have similar relative comparative characteristics (i.e.
equally similar to any other reference person). Speciﬁcally,
we make the following assumption in our model formulation:

Assumption 1. If a pair of unlabeled person images xi, xj
has high feature similarity f (xi)Tf (xj), we call the pair a
similar pair. If a similar pair has highly similar comparative
characteristics, it is probably a positive pair. Otherwise, it
is probably a hard negative pair.

For the similarity measure of the comparative characteris-
tics encoded in the pair of soft multilabels, we propose the
soft multilabel agreement A(·, ·), deﬁned by:

A(yi, yj ) = yi ∧ yj = Σk min(y

(k)
i

, y

(k)
j

) = 1 −

||yi − yj ||1

2

,

(2)

which is based on the well-deﬁned L1 distance. Intuitively,
the soft multilabel agreement is an analog to the voting by
the reference persons: Every reference person k gives his/her
conservative agreement min(y(k)
) on believing the pair
to be positive (the more similar/related a reference person is
to the unlabeled pair, the more important is his/her word),
and the soft multilabel agreement is cumulated from all the
reference persons. The soft multilabel agreement is deﬁned
based on L1 distance to treat fairly the agreement of every
reference person by taking the absolute value.

Now, we mine the hard negative pairs by considering
both the feature similarity and soft multilabel agreement
according to Assumption 1. We formulate the soft multilabel-
guided hard negative mining with a mining ratio p: We
deﬁne the similar pairs in Assumption 1 as the pM pairs

to a set of auxiliary reference persons represented by a set of reference agents {ai} (blue triangles, learnable parameters) in the feature
embedding. The soft multilabel judges whether a similar pair is positive or hard negative for discriminative embedding learning (Sec. 3.2).

that have highest feature similarities among all the M =
Nu × (Nu − 1)/2 pairs within the unlabeled target dataset
X . For a similar pair (xi, xj), if it is also among the top
pM pairs that have the highest soft multilabel agreements,
we assign (i, j) to the positive set P, otherwise we assign
it to the hard negative set N (see Figure 3). Formally, we
construct:

P = {(i, j)|f (xi)Tf (xj) ≥ S, A(yi, yj) ≥ T }
N = {(k, l)|f (xk)Tf (xl) ≥ S, A(yk, yl) < T }

(3)

where S is the cosine similarity (inner product) of the pM -th
pair after sorting all M pairs in an descending order accord-
ing to the feature similarity (i.e. S is a similarity threshold),
and T is the similarly deﬁned threshold value for the soft
multilabel agreement. Then we formulate the soft Multilabel-
guided Discriminative embedding Learning by:

By minimizing LM DL, we are learning a discriminative
feature embedding using the mined positive/hard negative
pairs. Note that the construction of P and N is dynamic
during model training, and we construct them within every
batch with the up-to-date feature embedding during model
learning (in this case, we simply replace M by Mbatch =
Nbatch × (Nbatch − 1)/2 where Nbatch is the number of
unlabeled images in a mini-batch).

the cross-view pairs which consist of two person images
captured by different camera views [52]. Therefore, the
soft multilabel should be consistently good across differ-
ent camera views to be cross-view comparable. From a
distributional perspective, given the reference persons and
the unlabeled target dataset X which is collected in a given
target domain, the distribution of the comparative charac-
teristic should only depend on the distribution of the person
appearance in the target domain and be independent of its
camera views. For example, if the target domain is a cold
open-air market where customers tend to wear dark clothes,
the soft multilabels should have higher label likelihood in the
entries which are corresponding to those reference persons
who also wear dark, no matter in which target camera view.
In other words, the distribution of the soft multilabel in every
camera view should be consistent with the distribution of the
target domain. Based on the above analysis, we introduce a
Cross-view consistent soft Multilabel Learning loss1:

LCM L = Σvd(Pv(y), P(y))2

(5)

where P(y) is the soft multilabel distribution in the dataset
X , Pv(y) is the soft multilabel distribution in the v-th camera

Given the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining,
we notice that most pairs in the RE-ID problem context are

view in X , and d(·, ·) is the distance between two distribu-
tions. We could use any distributional distance, e.g. the KL
divergence [11] and the Wasserstein distance [2]. Since we
empirically observe that the soft multilabel approximately
follows a log-normal distribution, in this work we adopt
the simpliﬁed 2-Wasserstein distance [4, 12] which gives a
very simple form (please refer to the supplementary material
for the observations of the log-normal distribution and the
derivation of the simpliﬁed 2-Wasserstein distance):

LCM L = Σv||µv − µ||2

2 + ||σv − σ||2
2

(6)

where µ/σ is the mean/std vector of the log-soft multilabels,
µv/σv is the mean/std vector of the log-soft multilabels in
the v-th camera view. The form of LCM L in Eq. (6) is
computationally cheap and easy-to-compute within a batch.
We note that the camera view label is naturally available in
the unsupervised RE-ID setting [52, 62], i.e. it is typically
known from which camera an image is captured.

3.4. Reference agent learning

A reference agent serves to represent a unique reference
person in the feature embedding like a compact “feature
summarizer”. Therefore, the reference agents should be
mutually discriminated from each other while each of them
should be representative of all the corresponding person
images. Considering that the reference agents are compared
within the soft multilabel function l(·), we formulate the
Agent Learning loss as:

LAL = Σk − log l(f (zk), {ai})(wk) = Σk − log

exp(aT
Σj exp(aT

wk f (zk))
j f (zk))

(7)

where zk is the k-th person image in the auxiliary dataset
with its label wk.

By minimizing LAL, we not only learn discriminatively
the reference agents, but also endow the feature embed-
ding with basic discriminative power for the soft multilabel-
guided hard negative mining. Moreover, it reinforces implic-
itly the validity of the soft multilabel function l(·). Speciﬁ-
cally, in the above LAL, the soft multilabel function learns
to assign a reference person image f (zk) with a soft mul-
tilabel ˆyk = l(f (zk), {ai}Np
i=1) by comparing f (zk) to all
agents, with the learning goal that ˆyk should have minimal
cross-entropy with (i.e. similar enough to) the ideal one-hot
label ˆwk = [0, · · · , 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0] which could produce the
ideal soft multilabel agreement, i.e. A( ˆwi, ˆwj) = 1 if zi
and zj are the same person and A( ˆwi, ˆwj) = 0 otherwise.
However, this LAL is minimized for the auxiliary dataset. To
further improve the validity of the soft multilabel function
for the unlabeled target dataset (i.e. the reference compara-
bility between f (x) and {ai}), we propose to learn a joint
embedding as follows.

is the domain shift [28], which is caused by different person
appearance distributions between the two independent do-
mains. To address this challenge, we propose to mine the
cross-domain hard negative pairs (i.e. the pair consisting of
an unlabeled person f (x) and an auxiliary reference person
ai) to rectify the cross-domain distributional misalignment.
Intuitively, for each reference person ai, we search for the
unlabeled persons f (x) that are visually similar to ai. For
a joint feature embedding where the discriminative distribu-
tions are well aligned, ai and f (x) should be discriminative
enough to each other despite their high visual similarity.
Based on the above discussion, we propose the Reference
agent-based Joint embedding learning loss2:

LRJ = ΣiΣj∈Mi Σk∈Wi [m − kai − f (xj)k2

2]+ + kai − f (zk)k2
2

(8)

where Mi = {j|kai − f (xj)k2
2 < m} denotes the mined
data associated with the i-th agent ai, m = 1 is the agent-
based margin which has been theoretically justiﬁed in [44]
with its recommaned value 1, [·]+ is the hinge function, and
Wi = {k|wk = i}. The center-pulling term ||ai − f (zk)||2
2
reinforces the representativeness of the reference agents to
improve the validity that ai represents a reference person in
the cross-domain pairs (ai, f (xj)).

We formulate the Reference Agent Learning by:

LRAL = LAL + βLRJ

(9)

where β balances the loss magnitudes.

3.5. Model training and testing

To summarize,

the loss objective of our deep soft

multilabel reference learning (MAR) is formulated by:

LM AR = LM DL + λ1LCM L + λ2LRAL

(10)

where λ1 and λ2 are hyperparameters to control the relative
importance of the cross-view consistent soft multilabel learn-
ing and the reference agent learning, respectively. We train
our model end to end by the Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD). For testing, we compute the cosine feature similarity
of each probe(query)-gallery pair, and obtain the ranking list
of the probe image against the gallery images.

4. Experiments

4.1. Datasets

Evaluation benchmarks. We evaluate our model in two
widely used large RE-ID benchmarks Market-1501 [59] and

2For brevity we omit the negative auxiliary term (i.e. wk 6= i) which
is for a balanced learning in both domains, as our focus is to rectify the
cross-domain distribution misalignment.

DukeMTMC-reID [61, 30]. The Market-1501 dataset has
32,668 person images of 1,501 identities. There are in total
6 camera views. The Duke dataset has 36,411 person images
of 1,404 identities. There are in total 8 camera views. We
show example images in Figure 4. We follow the standard
protocol [59, 61] where the training set contains half of the
identities, and the testing set contains the other half. We do
not use any label of the target datasets during training. The
evaluation metrics are the Rank-1/Rank-5 matching accuracy
and the mean average precision (MAP) [59].

Auxiliary dataset. Essentially the soft multilabel represents
an unlabeled person by a set of reference persons, and there-
fore a high appearance diversity of the reference population
would enhance the validity and capacity of the soft multil-
abel. Hence, we adopt the MSMT17 [50] RE-ID dataset as
the auxiliary dataset, which has more identities (i.e. 4,101
identities) than any other RE-ID dataset and which is col-
lected along several days instead of a single day (different
weathers could lead to different dressing styles). There are in
total 126,441 person images in the MSMT17 dataset. Adopt-
ing the MSMT17 as auxiliary dataset enables us to evaluate
how various numbers of reference persons (including when
there are only a small number of reference persons) affect
our model learning in Sec. 4.6.

4.2. Implementation details

We set batch size B = 368, half of which randomly
samples unlabeled images x and the other half randomly
samples z. Since optimizing entropy-based loss LAL with
the unit norm constraint has convergence issue [44, 37], we
follow the training method in [44], i.e. we ﬁrst pretrain
the network using only LAL (without enforcing the unit
norm constraint) to endow the basic discriminative power
with the embedding and to determine the directions of the
reference agents in the hypersphere embedding [44], then
we enforce the constraint to start our model learning and
multiply the constrained inner products by the average inner
product value in the pretraining. We set λ1 = 0.0002 which
controls the relative importance of soft multilabel learning
and λ2 = 50 which controls the relative importance of agent
reference learning. We show an evaluation on λ1 and λ2 in
Sec. 4.6. We set the mining ratio p to 5‰and set β = 0.2.
Training is on four Titan X GPUs and the total time is about
10 hours. We leave the evaluations on p/β and further details
in the supplementary material due to space limitation.

4.3. Comparison to the state of the art

We compare our model with the state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised RE-ID models including: (1) the hand-crafted feature
representation based models LOMO [20], BoW [59], DIC
[16], ISR [21] and UDML [29]; (2) the pseudo label learn-
ing based models CAMEL [52], DECAMEL [53] and PUL
[8]; and (3) the unsupervised domain adaptation based mod-

We show the results in Table 1 and Table 2.

From Table 1 and Table 2 we observe that our model
could signiﬁcantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.
Speciﬁcally, our model achieves an improvement over the
current state of the art (HHL in ECCV’18) by 20.2%/20.8%
on Rank-1 accuracy/MAP in the DukeMTMC-reID dataset
and by 5.5%/8.6% in the Market-1501 dataset. This obser-
vation validates the effectiveness of MAR.

Comparison to the hand-crafted feature representation
based models. The performance gaps are most signiﬁcant
when comparing our model to the hand-crafted feature based
models [20, 59, 16, 21, 29]. The main reason is that these
early works are mostly based on heuristic design, and thus
they could not learn optimal discriminative features.

Comparison to the pseudo label learning based models.
Our model signiﬁcantly outperforms the pseudo label learn-
ing based unsupervised RE-ID models [52, 8]. A key reason
is that our soft multilabel reference learning could exploit the
auxiliary reference information to mine the potential discrim-
inative information that is hardly detectable when directly
comparing the visual features of a pair of visually similar
persons. In contrast, the pseudo label learning based models
assign the pseudo label by direct comparison of the visual
features (e.g. via K-means clustering [52, 8]), rendering
them blind to the potential discriminative information.

Comparison to the unsupervised domain adaptation
based models. Compared to the unsupervised domain

adaptation based RE-ID models [50, 7, 62, 48], our model
achieves superior performances. A key reason is that these
models only focus on transfering/adapting the discriminative
knowledge from the source domain but ignore the discrimina-
tive label information mining in the unlabeled target domain.
The discriminative knowledge in the source domain could
be less effective in the target domain even after adaptation,
because the discriminative clues can be drastically different.
In contrast, our model mines the discriminative informa-
tion in the unlabeled target data, which contributes direct
effectiveness to the target RE-ID task.

4.4. Ablation study

We perform an ablation study to demonstrate (1) the ef-
fectiveness of the soft multilabel guidance and (2) the in-
dispensability of the cross-view consistent soft multilabel
learning and the reference agent learning to MAR. For (1),
we adopt the pretrained model (i.e. only trained by LAL
using the auxiliary source MSMT17 dataset to have basic
discriminative power, as mentioned in Sec. 4.2). We also
adopt a baseline model that is feature similarity-guided in-
stead of soft multilabel-guided. Speciﬁcally, after the same
pretraining procedure, we replace the soft multilabel agree-
ment with the feature similarity, i.e. in the hard negative
mining we partition the mined similar pairs into two halves
by a threshold of feature similarity rather than soft multilabel
agreement, and thus regard the high/low similarity half as
positive set P/hard negative set N . For (2), we remove the
LCM L or LRAL. We show the results in Table 3.
Effectiveness of the soft multilabel-guided hard negative
mining. Comparing MAR to the pretrained model where the
soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining is missing, we
observe that MAR signiﬁcantly improves the pretrained mod-
el (e.g. on Market-1501/DukeMTMC-reID, MAR improves
the pretrained model by 21.5%/24.0% on Rank-1 accuracy).
This is because the pretrained model is only discriminatively
trained on the auxiliary source dataset without mining the
discriminative information in the unlabeled target dataset,
so that it is not discriminative enough on the target dataset.
This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the soft

multilabel-guided hard negative mining.

Effectiveness of the soft multilabel agreement guidance.
Comparing MAR to the baseline model, we observe that
MAR also signiﬁcantly outperforms the similarity-guided
hard negative mining baseline model.
(e.g. on Market-
1501/DukeMTMC-reID, MAR outperforms the similarity-
guided hard negative mining baseline by 23.3%/17.1% on
Rank-1 accuracy). Furthermore, even when the soft multil-
abel learning and reference agent learning losses are missing
(i.e. “MAR w/o LCM L&LRAL” where the soft multilabel
is much worse than MAR), the soft multilabel-guided model
still outperforms the similarity-guided model by 14.8%/7.9%
on Rank-1 accuracy on Market-1501/DukeMTMC. These
demonstrate the effectiveness of the soft multilabel guidance.

Indispensability of the soft multilabel learning and the
reference agent learning. When the cross-view consisten-
t soft multilabel learning loss is absent, the performances
drastically drop (e.g. drop by 7.7%/5.4% on Rank-1 ac-
curacy/MAP in the Market-1501 dataset). This is mainly
because optimizing LCM L improves the soft multilabel com-
parability of the cross-view pairs [52], giving more accurate
judgement in the positive/hard negative pairs. Hence, the
cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning is indispens-
able in MAR. When the reference agent learning loss is
also absent, the performances further drop (e.g. drop by
13.8%/11.8% on Rank-1/MAP in the Market-1501 dataset).
This is because in the absence of the reference agent learn-
ing, the soft multilabel is learned via comparing to the less
valid reference agents (only pretrained). This observation
validates the importance of the reference agent learning.

4.5. Visual results and insight

To demonstrate how the proposed soft multilabel refer-
ence learning works, in Figure 5 we show the similar target
pairs with the lowest soft multilabel agreements (i.e. the
mined soft multilabel-guided hard negative pairs) mined by
our trained model. We make the following observations:

(1) For an unlabeled person image x, the maximal entries
(label likelihood) of the learned soft multilabel are corre-
sponding to the reference persons that are highly visually
similar to x, i.e. the soft multilabel represents an unlabeled
person mainly by visually similar reference persons.

(2) For a pair of visually similar but unlabeled person
images, the soft multilabel reference learning works by dis-
covering potential ﬁne-grained discriminative clues. For
example, in the upper-right pair in Figure 5, the two men
are dressed similarly. A potential ﬁne-grained discriminative
clue is whether they have a backpack. For the man taking
a backpack, the soft multilabel reference learning assigns
maximal label likelihood to two reference persons who also
take backpacks, while for the other man the two reference
persons do not take backpacks, either. As a result, the soft
multilabel agreement is very low, giving a judgement that

Figure 5. Visual results of the soft multilabel-guided hard negative
mining. Each pair surrounded by the red box is the similar pair
mined by our model with the lowest soft multilabel agreements, and
the images on their right are the reference persons corresponding
to the ﬁrst/second maximal soft multilabel entries. The ﬁrst row

this is a hard negative pair. We highlight the discovered
ﬁne-grained discriminative clues in the bottom of every pair.
These observations lead us to conclude that the soft multil-
abel reference learning distinguishes visually similar persons
by giving high label likelihood to different reference persons
to produce a low soft multilabel agreement.

4.6. Further evaluations

Various numbers of reference persons. We evaluate how
the number of reference persons affect our model learning.
In particular, we vary the number by using only the ﬁrst
Nu reference persons (except that we keep all data used in
LAL to guarantee that the basic discriminative power is not
changed). We show the results in Figure 6.

From Figure 6(a) we observe that: (1) Empirically, the
performances become stable when the number of reference
persons are larger than 1,500, which is approximately two
times of the number of the training persons in both dataset-
s (750/700 training persons in Market-1501/DukeMTMC-
reID). This indicates that MAR does not necessarily require
a very large reference population but a median size, e.g. two
times of the training persons. (2) When there are only a
few reference persons (e.g. 100), the performances drop
drastically due to the poor soft multilabel representation ca-
pacity of the small reference population. In other words, this
indicates that MAR could not be well learned using a very
small auxiliary dataset.

Hyperparameter evaluations. We evaluate how λ1 (which
controls the relative importance of the soft multilabel learn-
ing) and λ2 (the relative importance of the reference agent

Figure 7. From Figure 7 we observe that our model learning
is stable within a wide range for both hyperparameters (e.g.
2 × 10−5 < λ1 < 5 × 10−4 and 10 < λ2 < 200), although
both of them should not be too large to overemphasize the
soft multilabel/reference agent learning.

5. Conclusion

In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing
auxiliary source RE-ID data for mining the potential label
information latent in the unlabeled target RE-ID data. Specif-
ically, we propose MAR which enables simultaneously the
soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining, the cross-view
consistent soft multilabel learning and the reference agent
learning in a uniﬁed model. In MAR, we leverage the soft
multilabel for mining the latent discriminative information
that cannot be discovered by direct comparison of the abso-
lute visual features in the unlabeled RE-ID data. To enable
the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining in MAR,
we simultaneously optimize the cross-view consistent soft
multilabel learning and the reference agent learning. Experi-
mental results in two benchmarks validate the effectiveness
of the proposed MAR and each learning component of MAR.
