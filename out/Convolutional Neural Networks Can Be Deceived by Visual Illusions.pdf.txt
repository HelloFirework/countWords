Abstract

Visual illusions teach us that what we see is not always
what is represented in the physical world. Their special na-
ture make them a fascinating tool to test and validate any
new vision model proposed. In general, current vision mod-
els are based on the concatenation of linear and non-linear
operations. The similarity of this structure with the oper-
ations present in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
has motivated us to study if CNNs trained for low-level vi-
sual tasks are deceived by visual illusions. In particular, we
show that CNNs trained for image denoising, image deblur-
ring, and computational color constancy are able to repli-
cate the human response to visual illusions, and that the
extent of this replication varies with respect to variation in
architecture and spatial pattern size. These results suggest
that in order to obtain CNNs that better replicate human
behaviour, we may need to start aiming for them to better
replicate visual illusions.

1. Introduction

Visual illusions are fascinating examples of the complex-
ity of the human visual system, and of the intrinsic differ-
ence between perception and reality: while we constantly
assume that what we see is a faithful representation of the
world around us, visual illusions make clear that what we
see is just an internal construct of eyes and brain, because
our internal representation and the world itself often do not
match.

For instance, Fig. 1 shows a simple color illusion, where
three identical cats are seen as having quite different colors
depending on their surround. Visual illusions are so striking
because, even after we go and check that the three cats have
indeed the same triplet RGB value and therefore send the
same light to us, we still see them as having different colors.
There are many types of illusions apart from color-based,
involving other percepts such as brightness, motion, geom-

etry or grouping, to name a few [1]. For the visual science
community the study of visual illusions is key [2, 3], as the
mismatches between reality and perception provide insights
that can be very useful to develop new vision models of per-
ception or of neural activity [4], and also to validate existing
ones. This remains a very challenging open problem, as at-
tested by the variety of vision science models (e.g. percep-
tual models based on edge-integration, Gestalt-anchoring,
spatial-ﬁltering, intrinsic images or purely empirical ones)
and the fact that none of them can replicate a wide range of
visual illusions; even models that can successfully predict
an illusion may fail when a slight modiﬁcation (like adding
noise) is introduced [5].

A very popular approach in vision science is to model
neural activity and also perception as a cascade of modules,
each consisting of a linear convolution operation followed
by a nonlinearity, see [6] and references therein1. These are
of course the building blocks of convolutional neural net-
works (CNNs), but while the ﬁlters in visual models are de-
signed so that the model best replicates neural or perceptual
data, ﬁlters in CNNs are learned in a supervised manner in
order to perform a speciﬁc imaging task, such as classiﬁca-
tion, recognition or denoising, to name just a few.

The authors ﬁnd rather stunning that, given the impor-
tance of visual illusions for the vision science community,
the neural inspiration of CNNs, and that so often the aim
of CNNs is replicating human behaviour, there is virtually
no work done on linking visual illusions and CNNs. To the

deﬁnitely not the only approach to modeling in vision science, given their
well-known limitations [7].

best of our knowledge there are only two, very recent, pub-
lications in this regard. The ﬁrst one comes from the vision
science ﬁeld [8], where a CNN trained to predict videos was
able to reproduce motion illusions. In the second one, from
the perspective of computer vision [9], the authors classify
and attempt to generate new visual illusions using genera-
tive adversarial networks.

In this paper we report what we consider to be a quite re-
markable and surprising ﬁnding, namely that CNNs trained
on natural image databases for basic low-level vision tasks
reproduce the human response to some visual illusion im-
ages, i.e. the CNNs are deceived by the visual illusions in
the same way that we are deceived by them. Our other main
contribution is to study how the ability of these CNNs to
replicate visual illusions is affected by common architec-
ture variations and spatial pattern size.

These results have, we believe, important consequences
both for visual science and computer vision. For the vi-
sual science community, they support the idea that in order
to perform low level vision tasks, the human visual system
performs operations that as by-product create visual illu-
sions. Moreover, these ﬁndings could help vision science
in developing a taxonomy of which visual illusions are as-
sociated to which visual tasks. For the computer science
community, the results build a new bridge between CNNs
and the visual system. However, as it is shown on our ex-
periments, this relationship and its possible consequences
are constrained by the fact that not all optical illusions are
replicated by the CNNs here studied. This can shed light
on the limitations of CNNs for mimicking the visual sys-
tem, and therefore offers an opportunity for the design of
new architectures that, by better replicating visual illusions,
could behave more like humans do.

2. Methods

2.1. Replication of human visual perception

Let us start by explaining how vision science measures
the capacity of a model for replicating visual perception in
a particular scenario. Observers ﬁrst assess their percep-
tion of some aspect of the stimulus (e.g. the brightness) in
a manner that is quantiﬁable (e.g. by ranking it on a scale
from 0 to 5). Then, subject responses are averaged, and
these averages are compared with the output values pro-
duced by the model. This last comparison can be either
performed qualitatively or quantitatively.

In this paper, we will follow the qualitative paradigm.
We say that a CNN replicates a VI if the difference between
the values of the input image and the values of the output
produced by the CNN agrees qualitatively with human per-
ception. This is, if for instance we perceive a mid-gray level
to be a darker gray and the CNN turns a mid-gray input
value into an output value that is closer to black.

2.2. Selected visual illusions

There are two antagonistic basic effects in brightness and
color visual illusions known as assimilation and contrast. In
the case of assimilation effects, the image values change to-
wards those of the neighboring region. Conversely, in the
case of contrast effects, the image values move away from
those of the neighboring region. We choose two assimila-
tion VIs (Fig. 2a 2b), one contrast VI (Fig. 2d), and two
non-deﬁned (not assimilation, neither contrast) VIs (Fig. 2c
and 2e). The ﬁrst row in Figure 3 shows the color version
of the same VIs.

The illusions 2a-d present targets that have identical val-
ues but that are seen differently depending on their sur-
rounds. The targets are, in the Dungeon illusion ([10], Fig.
2a) the large central squares, in Hong-Shevell ([11], Fig.
2b) the middle rings, in the White illusion ([12], Fig. 2c)
the small grey bars, and in the Luminance gradient (Lum.)
illusion (combination of [13, 14], Fig. 2d) the circles. The
fact that the targets have indeed the same values (0.5 in all
cases) can be seen in the second row of Fig. 2, that plots
the image values along the segments shown in color over
the visual illusions in the top row. The Chevreul illusion
[15] presents homogeneous bands of increasing intensity,
from left to right, but these bands are perceived to be in-
homogeneous, with darker and brighter lines at the borders
between adjacent bands. In the color version (ﬁrst row in
Fig. 3), the phenomena are similar: for the Dungeon and
the Hong-Shevell cases, the right target must go towards
green and the left target towards red; for the White illusion,
the left target must go towards yellow and the right target
towards red; in the Luminance gradient illusion, the left tar-
gets should move towards red and the right targets towards
green; ﬁnally, the Chevreul illusion should be perceived in
the red channel analogously to the grayscale case.

2.3. Low level vision tasks studied

In this work we consider three key image processing
problems that have close correlates in human perception:
denoising that relates to our ability to discount noise in im-
ages [16], deblurring that relates to our capabilities of avoid
perceiving the blur provoked by moving objects [17], and
color constancy that relates to the way our perception of
colors matches quite well the reﬂectance properties of ob-
jects rather independently of the color of the illuminant.

2.4. CNN architectures

For our core experiment, we chose a very simple ar-
chitecture for the CNNs:
input and output layers of size
128 × 128 × 3 pixels, one hidden layer with eight features
maps with a receptive ﬁeld (kernel size) of ﬁve and no stride
(stride 1), and sigmoid activation functions. At the end there
is a convolutional layer that works as output layer (hence
it has three layers for the red, green, and blue channels).

Figure 2. The ﬁrst row displays the selected grayscale visual illusions as explained in Section 2. The scale of the illusions in the Figure is
different from the scale used in the experimenta for displaying purposes. The magenta and cyan lines represent the location in the images
of the proﬁles plotted in the rows 2-4.

Note that no pooling, residual connections or other modiﬁ-
cations were added to this architecture. Mean squared error
was used as loss function in all the tasks and all the models
were implemented2 using Keras [18]. We name the CNNs
based on the task they were trained for. Hence, DN-NET,
CC-NET, and DB-NET correspond to denoising, color con-
stancy, and deblurring, respectively

Then, we move to a similar CNN presented by Jain et
al. [19], one of the ﬁrst successful CNNs designed for im-
age denoising. Our implementation of this CNN, that we
denote as Jain2009 from now on, has an input/ouput size of
128× 128 and is composed of four hidden layers with a ker-
nel size of ﬁve and a sigmoid as activation function. This
CNN can be considered as a deeper version of the CNNs of
the ﬁrst experiment. We used this CNN to study common
variations in the architecture of CNNs and how they affect
to the replication of VIs.

Finally, we use a recent CNN for denoising (Zhang2017)

2The source code is publicly available at:

https://github.com/alviur/convnets_vs_vi

[20] to test the response for more complex architectures.

2.5. Datasets

For denoising we consider the Large Scale Visual Recog-
nition Challenge 2014 CLS-LOC validation dataset [21]
(which contains 50k images), and corrupts images with
additive Gaussian noise of σ = 25 after resize them to
128x128. For deblurring we consider the same dataset
as before, and blur the images with a Gaussian kernel of
σ = 2. For color constancy we consider the dataset of
Cheng et al. [22] that provides the color of the illumina-
tion for each image. We computed the ground-truth image
by applying the inverse of the illuminant color to the orig-
inal image, and then we performed an end-to-end training
between the original image and the ground-truth one. For
this problem, we divide each original image into four sub-
images in order to increase the pool of available images for
the training of the net. By doing this, we end up with a total
of 6944 images. In all three cases, the dataset was split in
70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for test.

Figure 3. The ﬁrst row displays the selected color visual illusions as explained in Section 2. The scale of the illusions in the Figure is
different from the scale used in the experimenta for displaying purposes. The black continuous and dashed lines represent the location in
the images of the proﬁles plotted in the rows 2-4. Only the proﬁles from the Red and the Green Channels are displayed.

2.6. Experiments

A base spatial scale for each of the ﬁve VIs was ﬁxed in
order to evaluate replication. This base scale was 4x4 pixels
(px.) target squares for Dungeon (Dun), 1 px. ring width
for Hong-Shevell, 4x4 px. target for White, 5 px. diameter
target for Luminance gradient (Lum.) and 10 px. step width
in Chevreul. A corresponding base size of the receptive ﬁeld
(also referred later as kernel size) was chosen to be 5x5.

In humans there is an observed relationship (see e.g. [1])

between spatial frequency and visual effect. In most cases
this relationship states that higher frequencies imply a larger
difference between the observed targets. This relationship
lead us to study the effect of the spatial scale in the replica-
tions of the VIs. For this end, we reasonable assume a re-
lation between the receptive ﬁeld and the spatial frequency
of the patterns. Following this assumption, we increase the
illusion’s scale by 3, 4 and 6 times the base scale. In the
case of the kernel size, we also test receptive ﬁeld sizes of

The ﬁrst two experiments consisted in evaluating the
replication of DN-NET, CC-NET and DB-NET when pre-
sented with all the selected grayscale (E1) and color (E2)
visual illusions for the base scales and kernel size.

Further experiments in the paper are restricted to the
color and grayscale versions of the Dungeon and the Lum.
illusions, which are representative of the opposite effects of
assimilation and contrast, respectively.

In the third experiment, we studied the replication for
DN-NET when the spatial scale and the kernel size are dif-
ferent from the base case. First, with ﬁxed kernel size, we
vary the illusion’s scale (E3a). Secondly, we modify both,
the scale of the illusions and the size of the receptive ﬁeld
(E3b).

We later moved to a deeper CNN (Jain2009) and we
tested its replication for the base scales and kernel size
(E4a). Then, in this same experiment, we tested all the
scales and all the sizes for the illusions and the receptive
ﬁelds, respectively.

Next, we studied three different variations of

the
Jain2009 CNN. First, two pooling layers were added to this
architecture after the ﬁrst and second convolutional layers
respectively. In order to recover the original scale of the in-
put, after each of the last two hidden convolutional layers
an upsampling layer was added. Pooling sizes of 2, 4, and
8 were tested (E4b). The second variation was to replace
the standard convolutional layers of Jain2009 with convo-
lutional layers with a dilation rate of 2, 4, and 8 (E4c).
The last test consisted on trying several conﬁgurations of
Jain2009 with residual connections (E4d).

The last experiment studied the replication of a state-of-
the-art CNN for denoising, Zhang2017. It was tested for the
base scale of the illusions (E5).

A summary of all experiments above presented can be

found in Table 1.

Finally, we addressed the question if simple image pro-
cessing algorithms can also explain the VI phenomena. In

particular, we study if a classical contrast enhancement
(CLAHE [23]) and a classical denoising (Total Variation
besed denoising [24]) can reproduce both assimilation and
contrast.

3. Results

Due to the outstanding amount of experiments and the
difﬁculty to show its results, in this paper we will focus on
some selected cases. Nevertheless, our selected cases rep-
resent the main effects and trends found in our proposed
experiments. We invite the reader to look at our supple-
mentary material for the full set of experiments.

We present our results as proﬁles of the output of the
CNN. A proﬁle is a 1-dimensional plot of the pixel values
of a row from the output image. For each VI, the plotted row
is indicated with a color segment over the VI. For instance,
in Fig. 2 the input proﬁles (second row) are the proﬁle of
the marked region (as magenta or cyan)in the VI (ﬁrst row).
This qualitative representation of results is common in vi-
sion science [2].

The output proﬁles showed in the ﬁgures corresponding
to grayscale illusions are the grayscale values obtained us-
ing the formula 0.2989R + 0.5870G + 0.1140B, with R, G
and B being the corresponding values in the red, green and
blue channels.

In all the results (output proﬁles) of this paper VI inputs
were not contaminated with noise or blurred before feeding
them to the CNNs. Additional experiments with contami-
nated inputs (not shown due to space limitation) resulted in
similar replication effects.

3.1. Replication of grayscale VIs (E1)

Fig. 2 shows the results of the experiment E1. We can see
that DN-NET is capable of replicating illusions from (a) to
(d) (see the row Output proﬁles: DN-NET in Fig. 2). While
Dungeon (a) and H.S. (b) are very well replicated, in White
(c) and Lum. (d) the effect is less marked. CC-NET repli-
cates illusions from (b) to (d) (see Output proﬁles: CC-NET

12313

Figure 4. Assimilation results in DN-NET for low and high frequency grayscale and color visual illusions.

in Fig. 2) but produces the opposite effect to that of human
perception in (a). Finally, DB-NET replicates illusions from
(b) to (e), but presents the same opposite effect as CC-NET
in (a). Nevertheless, DB-NET is the only one able to repli-
cate the effect for the Chevreul illusion in grayscale (e).

3.2. Replication of color VIs (E2)

In Fig. 3 we show the results of the experiment E2. DN-
NET replicates illusions (a),(b),(c), and (e). For Dungeon
(a) and H.S. (b) the right target increases its green value
(w.r.t. the input) while the left target increases its value in
the red channel. For White (c), the left target gets closer to
a yellow color by increasing its green channel value. In the
case of Chevreul (e), there is a slight replication in the red
channel. Finally, in the case of Lum. (d), DN-NET fails to
reproduce the VI.

DB-NET replicates all illusions except for H.S. (b). For
illusions Dungeon (a) and White (c) the effect is the same
as that observed for DN-NET. For Chevreul (e), the effect is
replicated both in the red and the green channels. Finally in
Lum. (d), there is a clear increase in the red and the green
channels for the left and the right targets respectively, to-
gether with a corresponding decrease of the same channels
in the opposite target.

3.3. Inﬂuence of scale of the VIs (E3a)

DN-NET reduces the replication error when the size of
the pattern is increased (increasing the size of the pattern is
equivalent to reducing the spatial frequency), therefore em-
ulating the behaviour observed in human perception [1]).
However, the reduction of the effect is dependent on the re-
ceptive ﬁeld size and on whether the illusion is in grayscale
or color.

The replication effect observed for DN-NET in the Dun-
geon illusion in grayscale is completely lost when moving
to sizes equal or larger than 8 pixels (see the middle col-
umn of the ﬁrst row in Fig. 4). However, the same VI in

color still replicates the effect for that size specially in the
red channel (middle column of the second row in Fig. 4).
The same evolution but in a smaller degree is also observed
in the case of Lum.

Furthermore, increasing the spatial frequency leads to an
attenuated replication, contrary to the effect produced in
human perception. Figure 4a in its ﬁrst row shows how
the assimilation effect in Dungeon almost disappears in
grayscale. That is also the case for the contrast effect in
Lum.
In the case of color, the assimilation effect is still
clearly present (Fig. 4a) but not the contrast effect of Lum.

3.4. Effect of receptive ﬁeld size (E3b)

For the Lum. VI, the use of larger receptive ﬁelds lead
to an increase of the replication effect. However, for the
Dungeon effect when using the largest receptive ﬁeld size
(15× 15), moving from a target size of 4 to 3 pixels changes
the assimilation into a contrast effect (see Fig. 4c). For the
color VIs there were no signiﬁcant qualitative changes for
either illusion.

Although there is a relation between the receptive ﬁeld
and the spatial frequency of the patterns. The nature of this
relation is not directly understood from the current experi-
ments. In most of the combinations of pattern’s frequency
and size of receptive ﬁeld tested the qualitative results do
not change.

3.5. Jain2009, a deeper architecture (E4a)

Figure 5 shows the results of Jain2009. We ﬁnd replica-
tion (although reduced) of both effects in grayscale. Despite
being four times deeper than DN-NET, Jain2009 shows
qualitatively similar results to the original DN-NET. For the
case of color VIs, there is still a replication of the assimila-
tion effect in Dungeon but not of the contrast effect in Lum.
(as was the case for DN-NET, see Fig. 3).

Figure 6. Selected results from Jain2009 when adding Pooling of size two. Assimilation effect is only replicated in color while the contrast
effect is replicated in grayscale.

3.6. Adding pooling layers to Jain2009 (E4b)

When pooling layers were used (in this case of size two)
the side effect in grayscale images is that higher frequency
VIs are destroyed. Also, in the case of Dungeon the replica-
tion is lost, in fact, the opposite effect is observed. However,
there is still a replication effect in Lum. for bigger target
sizes (see Fig. 6a). In the case of color, the same effect of
spatial pattern destruction occurs, but the replication effect
still remains for the Dungeon VI in the red and green chan-
nels. Larger pooling sizes lead to a total spatial destruction
of the patterns in the VIs such that further analysis is pre-
vented.

3.7. Adding dilated convolutions to Jain2009 (E4c)

Two main effects are observed when dilated convolu-
tions were added. First, the contrast effect of Lum. is not
replicated in grayscale or color for any of the dilation rates.
Second, in all the cases the effect in grayscale for Dungeon,
when considering targets equal or larger than 4 pixels, is no
longer replicated. In fact, it shows a contrast effect instead.
However, in the case of color there is still replication for the
Dungeon VI even when larger targets are considered (see
Fig. 6b second row).

A special case is observed only when using a dilation of
size four: Replication does appear in Dungeon in grayscale
for the smallest pattern size (shown in the left column of

Fig. 6b ﬁrst row). This is not the case for any other size of
the dilation.

3.8. Jain2009 with residual connections (E4d)

Several conﬁgurations of Jain2009 with residual connec-
tions were tested. They shared the effect of annulling the
replication of both Dungeon and Lum. in grayscale. How-
ever, an architecture with a single residual connection going
from the output of the ﬁrst convolutional layer to the input
of the ﬁnal output layer was still able to replicate the assim-
ilation effect in the grayscale Dungeon VI for the highest
frequency (see the left column in Fig. 6c). In the case of
color, for all the different variations of Jain2009 with resid-
ual connections, there is a replication for Dungeon even if
we increase the pattern size (second row in Fig. 6c ) but not
for Lum. in none of the cases.

3.9. Replication in recent denoising CNNs (E5)

Figure 7 shows how, to a small degree, Zhang2017 can
replicate the effect in both Dungeon and Lum. VIs. This
is also the case for the color VI, in where it behaves in the
same way as DN-NET and Jain2009.

3.10. VIs and classical image processing methods

It is to be expected that a sharpening ﬁlter, or a classic
contrast enhancement algorithm like CLAHE [23], may be

able to reproduce VIs that are of the contrast type, i.e. that
make the image value of a region to change in the oppo-
site direction to the values of the neighboring pixels. Anal-
ogously, a simple average ﬁlter, or a classic denoising al-
gorithm like Total Variation based denoising [24], may be
able to reproduce VIs that are of the assimilation type, i.e.
that make the image value of a region to change towards
the values of the neighbors of said region. Nevertheless,
these simple ﬁlters or classic algorithms do not seem able
to reproduce simultaneously both types of illusions, as ﬁg-
ure 3.7 shows. TV denoising reproduces Hong-Shevell (as-
similation) but not the Luminance illusion (contrast), while
CLAHE does the opposite. In contrast, the DB-NET and
DN-NET CNNs introduced in this paper were capable of
reproducing these two illusions at the same time.

4. Conclusions

In this work we showed that CNNs trained on natural
image databases for basic low-level vision tasks reproduce
the human response to some visual illusion images, i.e. the
CNNs are deceived by the visual illusions in the same way
that we are deceived by them. Versions of a single hid-
den layer CNN trained for denoising, color constancy, and
deblurring were tested to replicate ﬁve common visual il-
lusions. Deeper architectures and their common modiﬁ-
cations (such as pooling layers, dilated convolutions, and
residual connections) were explored too in order to evalu-
ate their effect in the replication of visual illusions. It was
found that even the simplest single hidden layer with 8 fea-
ture maps is already capable of replicating the human re-
sponse to several grayscale and color illusions. Moreover,
changes in the input image or CNN architecture lead to a

change in the illusions that the network is able to reproduce.
We argue that the CNNs in this paper reproduce visual
illusions as a by-product of the low level vision tasks of de-
noising, color constancy or deblurring. Albeit clearly dif-
ferent, the biological correlates of all of these tasks aim to
improve the efﬁciency of the representation and the visual
processing, so this supports the argument that visual illu-
sions are the price we have to pay in order to optimally use
the limited resources of our visual system.

The illusions that the CNNs are able to replicate depend
on the task each CNN is solving. It would be interesting,
from a vision science perspective, to use this insight to try to
associate speciﬁc illusions (or families of illusions) with vi-
sual processing tasks. Another interesting ﬁnding was that
CNNs trained with color images can replicate visual illu-
sions in grayscale too:
this could maybe give some cues
towards answering the question of where precisely in the
visual system is the brightness percept derived from color
signals, which is still an open one.

Finally, and from a computer vision perspective, if we
want CNNs that better replicate human behaviour, we
should maybe start aiming for them to better replicate vi-
sual illusions. We are currently working along these lines,
developing a CNN architecture with the goal of reproducing
as many visual illusions as possible, with validations from
psychophysical data.

As future work we want to evaluate if CNNs that repli-
cate visual illusions are more resistant to adversarial attacks
that do not fool humans. And to generate new visual illu-
sions using for instance generative adversarial networks.
