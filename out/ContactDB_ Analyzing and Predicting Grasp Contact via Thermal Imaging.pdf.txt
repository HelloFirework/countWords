Abstract

Grasping and manipulating objects is an important hu-
man skill. Since hand-object contact is fundamental to
grasping, capturing it can lead to important insights. How-
ever, observing contact through external sensors is chal-
lenging because of occlusion and the complexity of the hu-
man hand. We present ContactDB, a novel dataset of con-
tact maps for household objects that captures the rich hand-
object contact that occurs during grasping, enabled by use
of a thermal camera. Participants in our study grasped 3D
printed objects with a post-grasp functional intent. Con-
tactDB includes 3750 3D meshes of 50 household objects
textured with contact maps and 375K frames of synchro-
nized RGB-D+thermal images. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst large-scale dataset that records de-
tailed contact maps for human grasps. Analysis of this data
shows the inﬂuence of functional intent and object size on
grasping, the tendency to touch/avoid ‘active areas’, and
the high frequency of palm and proximal ﬁnger contact. Fi-
nally, we train state-of-the-art image translation and 3D
convolution algorithms to predict diverse contact patterns
from object shape. Data, code and models are available at
https://contactdb.cc.gatech.edu.

1. Introduction

Humans excel at grasping and then performing tasks
with household objects. Human grasps exhibit contact lo-

cations, forces and stability that allows post-grasp actions
with objects, and are also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the
post-grasp intent [8, 2, 45]. For example, people typically
grasp a knife by the handle to use it, but grasp it by the blunt
side of the blade to hand it off.

A large body of previous work [20, 29, 36, 46, 49, 3,
50, 52, 21, 36, 21, 6, 46] has recorded human grasps, with
methods ranging from data gloves that measure joint con-
ﬁguration to manually arranged robotic hands. ContactDB
differs signiﬁcantly from these previous datasets by focus-
ing primarily on the contact resulting from the rich inter-
action between hand and object. Speciﬁcally, we represent
contact through the texture of 3D object meshes, which we
call ‘contact maps’ (see Figure 1).

There are multiple motivations for recording grasping
activity through contact maps. Since it is object-centric,
it enables detailed analysis of grasping preferences inﬂu-
enced by functional intent, object shape, size and seman-
tic category, and learning object shape features for grasp
prediction, and grasp re-targeting to kinematically diverse
hand models. Previously employed methods of recording
grasping activity do not easily support such analysis, as we
discuss in Section 2.

We created ContactDB by recording human participants
grasping a set of 3D printed household objects in our labora-
tory, with two different post-grasp functional intents–using
the object and handing it off. See Section 3 for more details
on the data collection procedure, size of the dataset and the
kinds of data included.

Except for contact edges viewed from select angles, and

contact with transparent objects, contact regions are typi-
cally occluded from visual light imaging. Hence, existing
studies on the capture and analysis of hand-object contact
are extremely limited. Fundamental questions such as the
role of the palm in grasping everyday objects are unan-
swered. We propose a novel procedure to capture contact
maps on the object surface at unprecedented detail using an
RGB-D + thermal camera calibrated rig.

We make the following contributions in this paper:

• Dataset: Present a dataset recording functional human
grasping consisting of 3750 meshes textured with contact
maps and 375K frames of paired RGBD-thermal data.

• Analysis: Demonstrate the inﬂuence of object shape, size
and functional intent on grasps, and show the importance
of non-ﬁngertip contact.

• Prediction: Explore data representations and diverse
prediction algorithms to predict contact maps from ob-
ject shape.

2.1. Datasets of Human Grasps

Since contact between the human hand and an object is
fundamental to grasping and manipulation, capturing this
contact can potentially lead to important insights about hu-
man grasping and manipulation. In practice, however, this
has been a challenging goal. The human hand is highly
complex with extensive soft tissue and a skeletal structure
that is often modeled with 26 degrees of freedom. Hence,
previous work has focused on recording grasping activ-
ity in other forms like hand joint conﬁguration by man-
ual annotation [49, 3], data gloves [20, 29] or wired mag-
netic trackers [54, 16] (which can interfere with natural
grasping), or model-based hand pose estimation [50]. At
a higher level, grasping has been observed through third-
person [52, 21, 36] or ﬁrst-person [21, 6, 46] videos, in
which frames are annotated with the category of grasp ac-
cording to a grasp taxonomy [12, 23]. Tactile sensors are
embedded on a glove [4] or in the object [38] to record
grasp contact points. Such methods are limited by the reso-
lution of tactile sensors. Puhlmann et al [39] capture hand-
table contact during grasping with a touchscreen. Rogez
et al [42] manually conﬁgure a hand model to match grasps
from a taxonomy, and use connected component analysis on
hand vertices intersecting with an object model to estimate
contact regions on the hand.

Due to hand complexity and lack of understanding of
how humans control their hands, approaches like those
mentioned above have so far been limited to providing
coarse or speculative contact estimates. In contrast, our ap-
proach allows us to directly observe where contact between
the object and the human hand has taken place with an un-
precedented level of ﬁdelity.

2.2. Predicting Grasp Contact

Our work is related to that of Lau et al [26], which
crowdsources grasp tactile saliency. Online annotators are
instructed to choose a point they would prefer to touch, from
a pair sampled from the object surface. This pairwise infor-
mation is integrated to construct the tactile saliency map.
In contrast, ContactDB contact maps are full observations
of real human grasps with functional intent (see supple-
mentary material for a qualitative comparison). Akizuki
et al [1] use hand pose estimation and model-based ob-
ject tracking in RGB-D videos to record a set of contact
points on the object surface. This is vulnerable to inaccu-
racies in the hand model and hand pose tracking. Hamer at
al [19] record human demonstrations of grasping by regis-
tering depth images to get object geometry and object- and
hand-pose. Contact is approximated as a single point per
ﬁngertip. A large body of work in robotics aims to pre-
dict a conﬁguration of the end-effector [32, 9, 28] suitable
for grasping. In contrast to ContactDB, these works model
contact as a single point per hand digit, ignoring other con-
tact.

Diverse Predictions: Grasping is a task where multi-
ple predictions can be equally correct. Lee et al [27] and
Firman et al [14] have developed theoretical frameworks
allowing neural networks to make diverse and meaningful
predictions. Recently, Ghazaei et al [17] have used simi-
lar techniques to predict diverse grasp conﬁgurations for a
parallel jaw gripper.

3. The ContactDB Dataset

Here we present the design choices and process in creat-
ing the ContactDB, which consists of 50 3D printed house-
hold objects being grasped with two functional intents by
50 participants (see Table 1).

Observing Contact Through a Thermal Camera. At
the core of our data collection process is the use of a thermal
camera to observe the precise locations of contact between
human hand and object. Thermal cameras have recently
been used to capture humans and their interaction with the
environment. For example, Luo et al [31] observe humans
interacting with objects for egocentric SLAM, while Lar-
son et al [25] observe human ﬁnger interaction with arbi-
trary surfaces to make them interactive. Both note the phe-
nomenon of thermally observable contact, but do not inves-
tigate it rigorously or collect a large-scale dataset.

When a participant grasps an object, heat from the hand
transfers onto the object surface. If the object material does
not dissipate the heat rapidly, the precise contact areas can
be clearly observed in the thermal image after the object is
released (see Figure 2b).
Intensity at a pixel in the ther-
mal image is a function of the infrared energy emitted by
the corresponding world point [51]. Hence, object pixel in-

tensity in our thermal images is related to heat of the skin,
duration of contact, heat conduction (including diffusion to
nearby object locations), and contact pressure. By keep-
ing these factors roughly constant during data collection, we
veriﬁed empirically that heat conduction from hand-object
contact is the dominant factor in the observed thermal mea-
surements. See the supplementary material for more discus-
sion on heat dissipation and accuracy.

3.1. Object Selection and Fabrication

We decided to focus on household objects since an un-
derstanding of contact preferences and the ability to predict
them are most likely to improve human-robot interaction
in household settings. Other standard grasping datasets [7]
and competitions [10] have a similar focus. We started
with the YCB dataset [7] to choose the 50 objects in our
dataset. We excluded similarly-shaped objects (e.g. cereal
and cracker boxes) that are unlikely to produce different
kinds of grasps, deformable objects (e.g. sponge, plastic
chain, nylon rope), very small (e.g. dominoes, washers),
and very large objects (e.g. cooking skillet, Windex bot-

tle). We added common ones such as ﬂashlight, eyeglasses,
computer mouse, and objects popular in computer graphics
(e.g. Stanford bunny and Utah teapot). Since object size
has been shown to inﬂuence the grasp [11, 8] and we are
interested in contact during grasping of abstract shapes, we
included 5 primitive objects–cube, cylinder, pyramid, torus
and sphere–at 3 different scales (principal axes 12, 8 and 4
cm). See the supplementary material for a full object list.

We chose to 3D print all the objects to ensure uniform
heat dissipation properties. Additionally, we empirically
found that the PLA material used for 3D printing is ex-
cellent for retaining thermal handprints. We used open-
source resources to select suitable models for each object,
and printed them at 15% inﬁll density using white PLA ﬁl-
ament on a Dremel 3D20 printer. 3D printing the objects
has additional advantages. Having an accurate 3D model
of the object makes 6D pose estimation of the object from
recorded pointcloud data easier (see Section 3.3), which we
use for texture mapping contact maps to the object mesh.
3D printing the objects also allows participants to focus on
the object geometry during grasping.

3.2. Data Collection Protocol

Figure 2a shows our setup. We rigidly mounted a FLIR
Boson 640 thermal camera on a Kinect v2 RGB-D sensor.
The instrinsics of both the cameras and extrinsics between
them are calibrated using ROS [41], so that both RGB and
depth images from the Kinect can be accurately registered
to the thermal image. We invited 50 participants (mostly
20-25 years of age, able-bodied males and females), and

Institutional Review Board.

50 3D printed objects were placed at random locations
on a table in orientations commonly encountered in prac-
tice. Participants were asked to grasp each object with a
post-grasp functional intent. They held the object for 5 sec-
onds to allow heat transfer from the hand to the object, and
then hand it to an experimenter. The experimenter wore an
insulating glove to prevent heat transfer from their hand,
and places the object on a turntable about 1 m away from
the cameras. Participants were provided with chemical hand
warmers to increase the intensity of thermal handprints. The
cameras recorded a continuous stream of RGB, depth and
thermal images as the turntable rotated in a 360 degree
arc. The turntable paused at 9 equally spaced locations on
this arc, where the rotation angle of the turntable was also
recorded. In some cases, objects were ﬂipped and scanned a
second time to capture any thermal prints that were unseen
in the previous rotation.

We used two post-grasp functional intents:

‘use’ and
‘hand-off’. Participants were instructed to grasp 48 objects
with the intent of handing them off to the experimenter, and
to grasp a subset of 27 objects (after the previous thermal
handprints had dissipated) with the intent of using them.
We used only a subset of 27 objects for ‘use’, since other
objects (e.g. pyramid, Stanford bunny) lack clear use cases.
See the supplementary material for speciﬁc use instructions.
Participants were asked to avoid in-hand manipulation after
grasping to avoid smudging the thermal handprints.

3.3. Data Processing

As the turntable rotates with the object on it, the stream
of RGB-D and thermal images capture the object from mul-
tiple viewpoints. The aim of data processing is to texture-
map the thermal images to the object 3D mesh and generate
a coherent contact map (examples are shown in Figure 1).

The entire process is shown in Figure 2b. We ﬁrst ex-
tracted the corresponding turntable angle and RGB, depth
and thermal images at the 9 locations where the turntable
pauses. Next, we converted the depth maps to pointclouds
and useed a least-squares estimate of the turntable plane and
white color segmentation to segment the object. We used
the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) [5] algorithm implemented
in PCL [44] to estimate the full 6D pose of the object in
the 9 segmented pointclouds. Object origins in the 9 views
were used to get a least squares estimate of the 3D circle
described by the moving object. This circle was used to in-
terpolate the object poses for views which are unsuitable for
the ICP step because of noise in the depth map or important
shape elements of the object being hidden in that view, or
for rotating symmetric objects around the axis of symmetry.
Finally, the 3D mesh along with the 9 pose estimates and
thermal images were input to the colormap optimization al-

locally optimizes object poses to minimize the photomet-
ric texture projection error and generates a mesh coherently
textured with contact maps.

4. Analysis of Contact Maps

In this section we present analysis of some aspects of hu-
man grasping, using the data in ContactDB. We processed
each contact map separately to increase contrast by apply-
ing a sigmoid function to the texture-mapped intensity val-
ues that maps the minimum to 0.05 and maximum to 0.95.
Effect of Functional Intent. We observed that
the
intent (‘use’ or ‘hand off’) signiﬁcantly in-
functional
ﬂuences the contact patterns for many objects.
To
show qualitative examples, we clustered the contact maps
within each object and functional intent category using
k-medoids clustering [24] (k = 3) on the XYZ values
of points which have contact value above 0.4. The dis-
tance function between two sets of points was deﬁned
as d(p1, p2) = (cid:0) ¯d(p1, p2) + ¯d(p2, p1)(cid:1) / (|p1| + |p2|),
(j)
where ¯d(p1, p2) = P|p1|

metric objects, we chose the angle of rotation around the
axis of symmetry that minimized d(p1, p2). Figure 3 shows
dominant contact maps (center of the largest cluster) for the
two different functional intents.

To quantify the inﬂuence of functional intent, we deﬁne
‘active areas’ (highlighted in green in Figure 3) on the sur-
face of some objects and show the fraction of participants
that touched that area (evidenced by the map value being
greater than 0.4) in Table 2.
Effect of object size. Figure 4 shows the dominant con-
tact maps for objects of the same shape at three different
sizes. Small objects exhibit grasps with two or three ﬁn-
gertips, while larger objects are often grasped with more
ﬁngers and more than the ﬁngertips in contact with the ob-

single point. However, the contact maps in Figures 1, 3 and
4 show that human grasps have much more than ﬁngertip
contact. Single-point contact modeling is inspired by the
prevalence of rigid manipulators on robots, but with the re-
cent research interest in soft robots [13, 15], we now have
access to manipulators that contact the object at other areas
on the ﬁnger. Data in ContactDB shows the use of non-
ﬁngertip contact for highly capable soft manipulators: hu-
man hands. For each contact map, we calculated the contact
area by integrating the area of all the contacted faces in the
mesh. A face is contacted if any of its three vertices have a
contact value greater than 0.4. Figures 5(b) and 5(c) show
the contact areas for all objects under both functional in-
tents, averaged across participants. Next, we calculated an
upper bound on the contact area if only all 5 ﬁngertips were
touching the object. This was done by capturing the partici-
pants’ palm print on a ﬂat plate, where it is easy to manually
annotate the ﬁngertip regions (shown in Figure 5(a)). The
total surface area of ﬁngertips in the palm print is the de-
sired upper bound. It was doubled for objects for which we
observe bimanual grasps. This upper bound was averaged
across four participants, and is shown as the red line in Fig-
ures 5(b) and 5(c). Note that this is a loose upper bound,
since many real-world ﬁngertip-only grasps don’t involve
all ﬁve ﬁngertips, and we mark the entire object category

ject. Grasps for large objects are bi-modal: bimanual using
the full hands, or single-handed using ﬁngertips. To quan-
tify this, we manually labelled grasps as bimanual/single-
handed, and show their relation to hand size in Fig. 6.
The ﬁgure shows that people with smaller hands prefer to
grasp large objects (for ‘handoff’) with bimanual grasps.
No bimanual grasps were observed for the medium and
small object sizes.

How much of the contact is ﬁngertips? Contact is tradi-
tionally modelled in robotics [47] and simulation [53] as a

as bimanual if even one participant performs a bimanual
grasp. Total contact area for many objects is signiﬁcantly
higher than the upper bound on ﬁngertip-only contact area,
indicating the large role that the soft tissue of the human
hand plays in grasping and manipulation. This motivates
the inclusion of non-ﬁngertip areas in grasp prediction and
modeling algorithms, and presents an opportunity to inform
the design of soft robotic manipulators. Interestingly, the
average contact area for some objects (e.g. bowl, mug, PS
controller, toothbrush) differs across functional intent, due
to different kinds of grasps used.

5. Predicting Contact Maps

In this section, we describe experiments to predict con-
tact maps for objects based on their shape. ContactDB is the
ﬁrst large scale dataset that enables training data-intensive
deep learning models for this task. Since ContactDB in-
cludes diverse contact maps for each object, the mapping
from object shape to contact map is one-to-many and makes
the task challenging. We explore two representations for ob-
ject shape: single-view RGB-D, and full 3D. Since the con-
tact patterns are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the functional
intent, we train separate models for ‘hand-off’ and ‘use’.

Figure 7: Training procedure for single-view contact map
prediction. The discriminator has 5 conv layers followed by
batch norm and leaky ReLU.

5.1. Single-view Prediction

Object shape is represented by an RGB-D image, and a
2D contact map is predicted for the visible part of the ob-
ject. A single view might exclude information about im-
portant aspects of the object shape, and ‘interesting’ parts
of the contact map might lie in the unseen half of the ob-
ject. However, this representation has the advantage of be-
ing easily applicable to real-world robotics scenarios where
mobile manipulators are often required to grasp objects af-
ter observing them from a single view. We used generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based image-to-image transla-
tion [22, 57, 30] for this task, since the optimization proce-
dure of conditional GANs is able to model a one-to-many
input-output mapping [35, 18].

Figure 7 shows our training procedure and network ar-
chitecture, which has roughly 54M and 3M parameters in
the generator and discriminator respectively. We modiﬁed
pix2pix [22] to accept a 4-channel RGB-D input and pre-
dict a single-channel contact map. The RGB-D stream from
object scanning was registered to the thermal images, and
used as input. Thermal images were used as a proxy for
the single-view contact map. To focus the generator and
discriminator on the object, we cropped a 256×320 patch
around the object and masked all images by the object sil-

houette. All images from mug, pan, and wineglass were
held out and used for testing. Figure 8 shows some pre-
dicted contact maps for these unseen objects, selected for
looking realistic. Mug predictions for use have ﬁnger con-
tact on the handle, whereas contact is observed over the
top for handoff. Pan use predictions show grasps at the
handle, while handoff predictions additionally show a bi-
manual grasp of the handle and side. Similarly, the wine
glass indicates contact with a side grasp for use and over
the opening for handoff.

5.2. 3D Prediction

Full 3D representation gives access to the entire shape
of the object, and alleviates the view-consistency problems
observed during single-view prediction.
Learning a one-to-many-mapping. Stochastic Multiple
Choice Learning [27] (sMCL) trains an ensemble of k pre-
dictors to generate k contact maps for each input (see Fig-
ure 9a). Each input has multiple equally correct ground
truth maps. During training, the loss is backpropagated
from each ground truth contact map to the network that
makes the prediction closest to it. To encourage all mem-
bers of the ensemble to be trained equally, as mentioned
in [43], we made this association soft by routing the gradi-
ent to the closest network with a 0.95 weight and distributed
the rest equally among other members of the ensemble, and
randomly dropped entire predictions with a 0.1 probability.
We trained models with k = 1 and k = 10.

In contrast, DiverseNet [14] generates diverse predic-
tions from a single predictor network by changing the value
of a one-hot encoded control variable c that is concatenated
to internal feature maps of the network (See Figure 9b).
Each ground truth contact map is associated with the closest
prediction and gradients are routed through the appropriate
c value. Diverse predictions can be generated at test time
by varying c. Compared to sMCL, DiverseNet requires sig-
niﬁcantly fewer trainable parameters. We used 10 one-hot
encoded c values in our experiments.
3D representation. We represented the 3D object shape in

two forms: pointcloud and voxel occupancy grid. Point-
Net [40] operates on a pointcloud representation of the ob-
ject shape, with points randomly sampled from the object
surface. We normalized the XYZ position of each point to
ﬁt the object in a unit cube. The XYZ position and the nor-
malization scale factor were used as 4-element features for
each point. The network was trained by cross entropy loss
to predict whether each voxel is in contact. We used a Point-
Net architecture with a single T-Net and 1.2M parameters.

VoxNet [33] operates on a solid occupancy grid of the
object in a 643 voxelized space, and predicts whether each
voxel is contacted. It uses 3D convolutions to learn shape
features. The four features used for PointNet were used in
addition to the binary occupancy value to form a 5-element
feature vector for each voxel. Cross entropy loss was en-
forced only on the voxels on the object surface. The net-
work architecture is shown in Figure 9b, and has approxi-
mately 1.2M parameters.

Experiments We conducted experiments with both VoxNet
and PointNet, using the sMCL and DiverseNet strategies for
learning a one-to-many-mapping. For DiverseNet, we con-
catenated c to the output of the ﬁrst and ﬁfth conv layers
in VoxNet, and to the input transformed by T-Net and the
output of the second-last MLP in PointNet. Voxelization
of the meshes was done using the algorithm of [37] imple-
mented in binvox [34]. The PointNet input was generated
by randomly sampling 3000 points from the object surface.
We thresholded the contact maps at 0.4 after applying the
sigmoid described in Section 4, to generate ground truth for
classiﬁcation. We augmented the dataset by randomly ro-
tating the object around the yaw axis. PointNet input was
also augmented by randomly choosing an axis and scaling
the points along that axis by a random factor in [0.6, 1.4].
Dropout with p = 0.2 was applied to VoxNet-DiverseNet
input. We found that similar dropout did not improve results
for other models. Random sampling of surface points auto-
matically acts like dropout for PointNet models, and sMCL
models already incorporate a different dropout strategy as
mentioned in Section 5.2. The cross entropy loss for con-
tacted voxels was weighted by a factor of 10, to account for
class imbalance. All models were trained with SGD with a
learning rate of 0.1, momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of
5e-4. Batch size was 5 for models with k = 10, and 25 for
models with k = 1.

Table 3 shows results on held-out test objects (mug, pan
and wine glass). We conclude that the voxel occupancy grid
representation is better for this task, and that a model lim-
ited to making a single prediction does not capture the com-
plexity in ContactDB. Figures 10a and 10b show some of
the ‘use’ intent predictions for unseen object classes and
unseen shapes of training object classes respectively, se-
lected for looking realistic. Mug predictions show hori-
zontal grasps around the body. Predictions for the pan are

Table 3: Diverse 3D contact map prediction errors (%) for the models presented in Section 5.2. Errors were calculated by
matching each ground truth contact map with the closest from k diverse predictions, discarding predictions with no contact.
‘-’ indicates that no contact was predicted.

concentrated at the handle, with one grasp being biman-
ual. Wine glass predictions show grasps at the body-stem
intersection. Camera predictions show contact at the shut-
ter button and sides, while predictions for the hammer show
contact at the handle (and once at the head).

6. Conclusion and Future Work

We presented ContactDB, the ﬁrst large-scale dataset of
contact maps from functional grasping, analyzed the data
to reveal interesting aspects of grasping behavior, and ex-
plored data representations and training strategies for pre-

dicting contact maps from object shape. We hope to spur
future work in multiple areas. Contact patterns could in-
form the design of soft robotic manipulators by aiming to
be able to cover object regions touched by humans. Re-
search indicates that in some situations hand pose can be
guided by contact points [53, 48]. Using contact maps to
recover and/or assist in predicting the hand pose in func-
tional grasping is an exciting problem for future research.
