Abstract

We propose a densely semantically aligned person re-
identiﬁcation framework.
It fundamentally addresses the
body misalignment problem caused by pose/viewpoint vari-
ations, imperfect person detection, occlusion, etc. By lever-
aging the estimation of the dense semantics of a person im-
age, we construct a set of densely semantically aligned part
images (DSAP-images), where the same spatial positions
have the same semantics across different images. We de-
sign a two-stream network that consists of a main full image
stream (MF-Stream) and a densely semantically-aligned
guiding stream (DSAG-Stream). The DSAG-Stream, with
the DSAP-images as input, acts as a regulator to guide
the MF-Stream to learn densely semantically aligned fea-
tures from the original image. In the inference, the DSAG-
Stream is discarded and only the MF-Stream is needed,
which makes the inference system computationally efﬁcient
and robust. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst
to make use of ﬁne grained semantics to address the mis-
alignment problems for re-ID. Our method achieves rank-1
accuracy of 78.9% (new protocol) on the CUHK03 dataset,
90.4% on the CUHK01 dataset, and 95.7% on the Mar-
ket1501 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

1. Introduction

Person re-identiﬁcation (re-ID) aims to match a speciﬁc
person across multiple camera views or in different occa-
sions from the same camera view. It facilitates many im-
portant applications, such as cross-camera tracking [40].

This task is challenging due to large variations on person
pose and viewpoint, imperfect person detection, cluttered
background, occlusion, and lighting differences, etc. Many
of these factors result in spatial misalignment of the human
body as shown in Fig. 1, where the same spatial positions do
not correspond to the same semantics. The misalignment is
one of the key challenges [30, 33, 53, 37, 48, 34, 57], which
compromises performance.

ment in person re-ID caused by (a) different camera viewpoints,

ment within a local part, (e) cluttered background, (f) occlusion.

Some paradigms employ the convolutional neural net-
works to learn global feature representation in an end-to-
end manner [1, 43, 8, 4, 2]. However, the capability of the
global representations is limited by: 1) the lack of emphasis
on local differences [48], and 2) the absence of any explicit
mechanism to tackle the misalignment [2].

In recent years, many efforts have been made to alleviate
these problems [33, 53, 37, 48, 34, 19]. To make the features
focus on some local details, some works make a straightfor-
ward partition of the person image into a few ﬁxed rigid
parts (e.g., horizontal stripes) and learn detailed local fea-
tures [5, 37, 18, 3, 35, 39]. However, such a partition can-
not well align the human body parts. Some works have at-
tempted the use of pose (which identiﬁes different types of
parts, e.g., head, arm, etc.) to localize body parts for learn-
ing part-aligned features [47, 15, 49, 33, 53, 42]. However,
the body part alignment based on pose is too coarse to have
satisfactory alignment. As shown in Fig. 1 (d), even for the
same type of parts, there is still spatial misalignment within
the parts, where the human semantics are different for the
same spatial positions. It becomes critical to design an ar-
chitecture which enables the efﬁcient learning of densely

semantically aligned features for re-ID.

In this paper, we propose a novel densely semanti-
cally aligned person re-ID framework, which fundamentally
enables ﬁne-grained semantic alignment and semantically
aligned feature learning in re-ID.

First, we propose performing dense semantic alignment
of the human body on a canonical space to address the
misalignment challenges in person re-ID. We are inspired
by the dense semantics estimation work of DensePose [9],
which is capable of predicting the ﬁne-grained pixel-level
semantics of a person. Different from pose with only a
limited number of coarse key joints, dense semantics estab-
lishes dense correspondences between a 2D person image
and a 3D surface-based canonical representation of the hu-
man body [9, 10]. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the 3D surface
of a person is segmented into 24 semantic body regions.
Within a region, the semantics of each position is identiﬁed
by a two-dimensional UV coordinate. Based on the esti-
mated dense semantics in terms of UV coordinate values
(on the U,V map), the original input image is warped to 24
densely semantically aligned part images (DSAP-images)
in the UV space. In this way, person images with different
viewpoints, poses, and backgrounds are semantically well
aligned. Thus, such representation has the inherent merits
for addressing misalignment challenges. Note that not only
the coarse body part regions are aligned, but also the con-
tents within a part are densely aligned at the pixel level.

Second, we propose a new framework intending to fully
exploit the densely semantically aligned representations for
person re-ID. For dense semantics estimation, since the
person in a 2D image is a projection from a 3D person,
nearly half of the 3D surface is invisible and thus cannot
be detected from the 2D image (see the examples of the 24

DSAP-images in Fig. 2, where many of the DSAP-images
do not have valid information). Besides, there are usually
estimation errors, including missing detection, especially
on the images of the re-ID dataset which usually have low
resolution and blurring artifacts. It remains challenging to
design an effective network to fully exploit the semanti-
cally aligned information as there are loss of information
and noise there.

In our design, we leverage the densely semantically
aligned information to drive the main network to learn se-
mantically aligned features from the original image. As
shown in Fig. 3, our network consists of a main full im-
age stream (MF-Stream) and a densely semantically aligned
guiding stream (DSAG-Stream). For the MF-Stream, the
full image is taken as the input. For the DSAG-Stream, the
24 DSAP-images obtained from the dense semantic align-
ment module are taken as the input. Rather than mak-
ing the features of the two streams both have re-ID abil-
ity, the DSAG-Stream acts as a regulator to guide the MF-
Stream to learn semantically aligned features. We achieve
this by element-wise fusing of the MF-Stream features and
the DSAG-Stream features, with supervisions added on the
fused features. End-to-end joint training enables the inter-
action and joint optimization of the two streams.

In summary, we have made three main contributions.

• We propose making use of dense semantic alignment for

person re-ID, addressing the misalignment challenges.

• A densely semantically aligned deep learning based
framework is proposed for person re-ID. To the best of
our knowledge, our proposed framework is the ﬁrst one
to make use of ﬁne grained semantics to address the mis-
alignment problems for effective person re-ID. We pro-
pose an effective fusion and supervision design to fa-
cilitate semantically aligned feature learning. It enables
the interaction between the DSAG-Stream and the MF-
Stream during the learning process. This greatly en-
hances the power of the MF-Stream even though its input
images are not semantically aligned.

• The DSAG-Stream, as a regulator, can be removed during
the inference without sacriﬁcing the performance. This
also removes the dependency on the performance of the
dense semantics estimator during interference, making
the inference model more computationally efﬁcient and
robust to dense semantics estimation errors.

We perform extensive ablation studies and the experi-
mental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture
with the dense semantic alignment are very powerful. We
achieve state-of-the art performance on the Market-1501,
CUHK03, and CUHK01 datasets, and competitive perfor-
mance on DukeMTMC-reID. On the CUHK03 dataset, our
performance signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous meth-
ods, by at least +10.9%/+7.8% in Rank-1/mAP accuracy.

3. Densely Semantically Aligned Person Re-ID

Body part/pose-aligned approaches. Spatial misalign-
ment is ubiquitous and is one of the key challenges in re-
ID. In the early works, some patch-based methods perform
patch-level matching to address patch-wise misalignment
[23, 51, 52]. To avoid mismatched patches with similar ap-
pearances [30], human semantics of part/pose is introduced
so that the similarity matching is performed between the
semantically corresponding parts [6, 46]. In recent years,
human semantics in terms of part/pose is widely used to lo-
calize body parts for part-aligned deep feature learning and
matching [47, 15, 49, 33, 53, 42]. In [42], body poses/parts
are ﬁrst detected and deep neural networks are designed for
representation learning on both the local parts and global
region. Some works rely on constrained attention selection
mechanisms from human mask/part/pose to implicitly cali-
brate misaligned images [32, 25, 45, 14, 34].

All the above works aim to address misalignment at the
coarse body part level. However, there is still misalignment
within each part. Our work intends to fundamentally ad-
dress the misalignment problem. It differs from previous
works in three main aspects. First, our approach intends to
fully exploit the ﬁne-grained semantically aligned represen-
tations. Second, we leverage the semantically aligned rep-
resentations, which play the role of regulators, to guide the
semantic feature learning from the original image. Third,
during inference, we do not need the DSAG-Stream, mak-
ing our model computationally efﬁcient and robust.

Local and global based approaches. Many approaches
make use of both the global and local feature to simultane-
ously exploit their advantages [3, 39, 18, 42, 33, 49, 48].
Global features learned from the full image intend to cap-
ture the most discriminative clues of appearance but may
fail to capture discriminative local details. Thus, part-based
features are exploited as a remedy. Wang et al. design a
multiple granularity network, which consists of one branch
for global features and two branches for local feature repre-
sentations [39]. In [48], the image feature map is rigidly di-
vided into local stripes and a shortest path loss is introduced
to align local stripes. This aids the global feature learn-
ing by means of sharing weights of the backbone network.
However, the alignment is still too coarse without consid-
ering person dense semantics. We leverage the densely se-
mantically aligned representation to guide the learning of
both the global features and part-aware features.

Approaches based on joint multi-loss learning. Zheng
et al. suggest that person re-ID lies in between image clas-
siﬁcation and instance retrieval [55]. The classiﬁcation task
and ranking task are complementary to each other. Re-
cently, some approaches [43, 21, 4, 39] optimize the net-
work simultaneously with both classiﬁcation loss and rank-
ing loss, e.g., triplet loss [29, 13]. Similarly, we leverage
the complementary advantages of the two tasks.

We propose a new framework aiming to fully exploit
the densely semantically aligned representations for ro-
bust person re-ID. Fig. 3 shows the ﬂowchat. The net-
work consists of two streams: the main full image stream
(MF-Stream), and the densely semantically aligned guiding
stream (DSAG-Stream). Based on the dense semantic align-
ment module, from the input person image, we construct 24
densely semantically aligned part images (DSAP-images)
as the input to the DSAG-Stream. Having the merits of be-
ing semantically aligned, the DSAG-Stream acts as a regula-
tor to regularize the feature learning of the MF-Stream from
the original image, through our fusion and loss designs. The
entire network is trained in an end-to-end manner. We dis-
cuss the details in the following subsections.

3.1. Construction of DSAP images

Dense semantics annotation/estimation on 2D images
[9] establishes dense correspondences from 2D images to
the human body surface. Each position on the surface
has a different semantic meaning, which can be parameter-
ized/represented by a two-dimensional UV coordinate value
[10, 9]. The same UV coordinate value corresponds to the
same semantics. Thus, in the UV space, the dense seman-
tics are inherently aligned.

For the dense semantic alignment module, the original
RGB image is warped to the representation in UV space
to obtain 24 DSAP-images based on the estimated dense
semantics.

Dense semantics estimation. We adopt the off-the-
shelf DensePose model (trained on the DensePose-COCO
dataset) [9] to estimate the dense semantics of a 2D image.
It segments a person to 24 surface-based body part regions.
For each detected body part, the semantics for each pixel
is provided in terms of a coordinate value (u,v) in the UV
space, where u,v ∈[0,1]. Please refer to [9] for more details.
Warping. For the i-th body part region, as illustrated in
Fig. 2, based on the semantics, the pixel values on the per-
son can be warped onto a DSAP-image of size S×S in the
deformation-free UV space, where the rows and columns
represent the U and V, respectively. The DSAP-images are
initialized by the mean values of images before the warping.
Note that the background and not detected semantic posi-
tions are not warped. We simply copy the pixel value (r,g,b)
of the body parts with its semantics estimated as (u,v) to the
(⌊u × S⌋, ⌊v × S⌋) position of the corresponding DSAP-
image. ⌊x⌋ is the function to get the greatest integer less
than or equal to x and we set S to 32 in our experiments.

Discussion. For the DSAP-images of the i-th body part,
the semantic identities on the same spatial positions are al-
ways the same. They are densely semantically aligned.

Such representations have three major advantages. 1) It
overcomes spatial misalignment challenges resulting from

DSAG-Stream, which are jointly trained through our fusion and supervision design. The DSAG-Stream, with the input DSAP-images that
are densely semantically aligned, plays the role of a regulator which facilitates the joint optimization of the entire network. In the inference,
to be computationally efﬁcient, the DSAG-Stream is discarded. The global features fG and part-aware features fL = fL,i|8

diverse viewpoints and poses, and imperfect person de-
tection. 2) It avoids the interference from diverse back-
ground clutters since only human body regions are warped
to DSAP-images. 3) It is free from the appearance interfer-
ence from occlusion since the semantics are not estimated
over the occluding objects.

DSAP-images, however, have three limitations with re-
spect to its roles in the person re-ID task. 1) The valid
contents on the DSAP-images are very sparse (see Fig. 2).
As a 2D projection from the 3D surface, nearly half of the
body regions are invisible on the 2D image and thus cannot
be detected by DensePose. Besides, there are usually esti-
mation errors, including missing detections, especially on
images with low resolution and blurring artifacts. 2) The
dense semantics estimator is not optimal. Since there is no
labeled dense semantics for the re-ID datasets, we lever-
age the DensePose model trained on the COCO-DesenPose
dataset. However, there is a gap between these datasets in
resolutions, image quality, and pose distributions. 3) Since
the background is removed, some discriminative contents,
such as a red backpack, are also removed.

3.2. Joint Learning of Our Network

Due to the sparsity of valid contents and potential seman-
tics estimation errors on the DSAP-images (as discussed in

subsection 3.1), it is very challenging to design an effec-
tive network to exploit the semantically aligned information
from the DSAP-images alone. In fact, a few of our early
attempts along this line (with only the DSAP-images as in-
put) have failed to deliver good results. To exploit the mer-
its of the DSAP-images while addressing the above men-
tioned challenges, in our design, we propose treating them
as regulators in an end-to-end network to drive the semanti-
cally aligned feature learning from the original full image.
One important advantage of this design is that during the
inference, the regulators are not needed, making it compu-
tationally efﬁcient. This also removes the dependency of
the inference on the performance of the dense semantics es-
timator, making the system practically more robust.

Fig. 3 shows the ﬂowchat. The DSAG-Stream plays the
role of a regulator to assist the training of the MF-Stream.
We achieve this through the corresponding feature fusion
between the DSAG-Stream and the MF-Stream, and the su-
pervision on the fused features. For the DSAG-Stream,
the input DSAP-images are densely semantically aligned
and thus the output features inherit the merits. We intend
to leverage the DSAG-Stream to drive the MF-Stream to
learn both global features and part-aware features. For each
stream, a small head network with two branches are de-
signed to focus on global and local information respectively.

3.2.1 DSAG-Stream

The DSAG-Stream consists of
the multi-branch sub-
networks (MB-Ns) and a small Head network formed by
a global branch and a part branch as shown in Fig. 3. We
show the detailed architectures in Table 1.

Multi-branch sub-networks (MB-Ns). Both global in-
formation and local details are important and complemen-
tary for re-ID [3, 39, 18, 42, 33, 49]. In order to learn local
detailed features of the separate region part rather than mix-
ing all parts together, we adopt multi-branch sub-networks
(MB-Ns) to learn local feature maps Di ∈ Rh×w×c of size
h × w with c channels, i = 1, 2, · · · , N , for N merged
body part regions, respectively. Note that the N body part
regions have no overlap. The N feature maps are con-
catenated along channels and we have D = Di|N
i=1 =
[D1, D2, · · · , DN ] ∈ Rh×w×cA , where cA = N ×c.

For the MB-Ns, we have two levels of merging to pro-
gressively merge features from correlated body parts, in
order to exploit the symmetry of human body to be bet-
ter viewpoint robust and to reduce the number of branches.
We obtain 8 separate feature maps from MB-Ns as Di|N
i=1,
where N = 8. The semantics for a pair of left-right sym-
metric parts, are semantically aligned in the UV space and
we element-wisely add the features in the ﬁrst level merg-
ing. At the second level merging, similarly, we merge the
two branches corresponding to the front-back symmetric
parts and ﬁnally obtain 8 branches as illustrated in Fig. 4.

Head network.

It consists of two separate branches

which focus on global and local information respectively.

For the global branch, the output feature vector dG ∈

R2048 are obtained by

dG = P(H(D)),

(1)

where H(·) denotes an underlying mapping consisting of a
few stacked layers; P(·) denotes the average spatial pooling
operation. We take the network architecture of conv5 g as
shown in Table 1 for this mapping of P(H(·)).

For the part branch, the output feature vector dL ∈ R2048
is a concatenation of the feature vectors dL,i ∈ R256 of the
8 merged parts, i.e., dL = [dL,1, dL,2, · · · , dL,8], with dL,i
obtained by

the part-aware features fL are learned by the two separate
branches of a small Head network. This Head network
architecture is similar to the Head network of the DSAG-
Stream. Note that the features fG and fL are used for re-ID
in our ﬁnal scheme.

3.2.3 Two-Stream Fusion

We fuse the global features from the two streams by
element-wise adding, i.e., zG = fG + dG, which enables
the joint optimization of the two streams. Similarly, the
part-aware features and part features from the two streams
are fused as zL = fL + dL.

3.2.4 Loss Designs

To train the network, we use the widely-used identiﬁcation
loss (ID Loss), i.e., the cross entropy loss for identiﬁcation
classiﬁcation, and the ranking loss of triplet loss with batch
hard mining [13] (Triplet Loss) as our loss functions.

Considering the noises in the DSAP-images due to se-
mantics estimation errors, and the high complexity of the
DensePose model, in our design, we treat the DSAP-images
as regulators to drive the semantically aligned feature learn-
ing from the original full image, expecting the MF-Stream
alone to work in inference. We add supervision to the fea-
tures fG, fL from the MF-Stream and to the fused features
zG, zL, respectively as illustrated in Fig. 3. Speciﬁcally,
for the MF-Stream, we add the ID loss for the global fea-
ture vector fG, and each part-aware feature vector fL,i, i =
1, 2, · · · , 8. For the fused features zG, zL, both the ID
loss and triplet loss are added. The loss computed using
the fused features makes the gradient back-propagated to
the MF-Stream be also inﬂuenced by the DSAG-Stream fea-
tures, since they contribute to the fused features and the re-
sulting loss. In this way, the DSAG-Stream plays the role
of regularization by impacting the feature learning of the
MF-Stream in the training.

To calculate each identiﬁcation loss, a classiﬁer con-
structed by two fully connected (FC) layers followed by a
SoftMax function is applied to the feature vector to output
the classiﬁcation probability.

are used for training and the remaining for testing.

CUHK01 [16] comprises 3884 images of 971 identities,
captured in two disjoint camera views. We adopt the com-
mon experimental setting following [1, 5, 50].

DukeMTMC-reID [56] is a subset of Duke Dataset [27]
for image-based re-ID. We use the standard training/testing
split and evaluation setting following [56, 20]. It contains
16,522 training images of 702 identities, 2,228 query im-
ages of the other 702 identities and 17,661 gallery images.
Evaluation Metrics. Following the common practices,
we use the cumulative matching characteristics (CMC) at
Rank-1 (at least), Rank-5, Rank-10, and mean average pre-
cision (mAP) to evaluate the accuracy.

4.2. Implementation Details

Network settings. We take ResNet-50 [11] to build our
baseline networks as in some re-ID systems [3, 35, 48, 2].
Similar to [35], the last spatial down-sample operation in
the Conv5 layer is removed.

For the MF-Stream, we use a part of the ResNet-50 archi-
tecture (i.e., conv1, conv2 x to conv4 x) as the sub-network

to obtain the feature map F. The weights pretrained on Im-
ageNet [7] are used for initialization. The Head network
architecture is similar to the Head network of the DSAG-
Stream and is randomly initialized. The difference is that
the architecture of the global branch in the MF-Stream is
the same as the network architecture of the conv5 x block in
ResNet-50 rather than that in ResNet-18. Each local branch
of the MF-Stream uses an architecture similar to the global
branch but has only 1/8 of the number of channels on each
layer. For the DSAG-Stream, the network is randomly ini-
tialized and trained from scratch.

Data augmentation. We use the commonly used data
augmentation strategies of random cropping [41], horizon-
tal ﬂipping and random erasing [59, 41, 38] (with a proba-
bility of 0.5) in both the baseline schemes and our schemes.
Optimization. For the triplet loss with batch hard min-
ing [13], we sample P = 16 identities and K = 4 images
[39] for each identity as a mini-batch and the margin pa-
rameter is set to 0.3. The ID loss for the MF-Stream fea-
tures, the triplet loss, and ID loss for the fused features are
weighed by 0.5, 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. We adopt Adam
optimizer with a weight decay of 5×10−4 to train our mod-
els. We warm up the models for 20 epochs with a linear
growth learning rate from 8 × 10−6 to 8 × 10−4. Then,
the learning rate is decayed by a factor of 0.5 for every 40
epochs. We observe that the models converge after training
of 320 epochs. All our models are implemented on PyTorch
and trained in an end-to-end manner.

4.3. Comparison with State of the Art

We compare our proposed Densely Semantically
Aligned re-ID scheme (DSA-reID) with current state-of-
the-art methods of four categories in Table 2. Basic-CNN
methods have similar network structures with a commonly
used baseline in deep re-ID systems [53, 48, 3, 39, 38],
which learns a global descriptor. Pose/Part-related meth-
ods leverage the coarse pose/part semantic information to
assist re-ID. Stripe-based methods divide the full RGB im-
age/feature map into several horizontal stripes to exploit lo-
cal details. MGN [39] combines the local features of mul-
tiple granularities and the global features. Attention-based
methods [50, 19, 31, 38] jointly learn attention selection and
feature representation. Note that we do not implement re-
ranking [58] in all our models for clear comparisons.

Market-1501. DSA-reID achieves the best performance.
Our method and the second best method MGN [39] have
similar performance and both outperform the other meth-
ods by at least +1.9%/+4.6% in Rank-1/mAP accuracy. We
only show the single query (SQ) results to save space, and
a similar trend is observed for the multiple query setting.

CUHK03. DSA-reID outperforms others by a large mar-
gin, at least +10.9%/+7.8% in Rank-1/mAP for the labeled
setting, and +11.4%/+7.1% in Rank-1/mAP for the de-
tected setting. The images are less blurred than those in
other datasets. The semantics estimation is more accurate
which greatly helps the training of our networks.

CUHK01. Our method outperforms the current best re-
sult by +2.3%/+1.1% in Rank-1/Rank-5 accuracy. Similar
to the methods in [5, 50, 34], this result is obtained with pre-
training on CUHK03 and ﬁne-tuning on CUHK01. For fair
comparisons, we also test our model without a pre-training
on CUHK03, it achieves 88.6%/97.1% in Rank-1/Rank-5
respectively, which are also the best.

DukeMTMC-reID. DSA-reID achieves the second best
results. The semantics estimation on this dataset is er-
ror prone. More than 20% persons cannot be detected on
the training images. DSA-reID outperforms all the other
approaches except MGN [39] which ensembles local fea-
tures at multiple granularities. We believe training a better
DensePose estimator can further improve the performance.

4.4. Ablation Study

We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the

Market-1501 dataset (single query).

Ours vs. baselines. In Table 3, “Baseline” and “Base-
line(RE)” denote our baseline schemes without and with
random erasing (RE) [2, 38], respectively. Label smoothing
regularization [36], which acts as a mechanism to regularize
the classiﬁer layer by changing the ground-truth label distri-
bution, has been demonstrated to be effective in recognition
[24, 44]. We add label smoothing (LS) to the classiﬁca-
tion sub-task in the re-ID and denote this baseline as “Base-
line(RE+LS)”. It improves the Rank-1/mAP accuracy over
“Baseline(RE)” by +1.1%/+2.6%. Besides, we also take
our MF-Stream only scheme that is built based on “Base-
line(RE+LS)” but with a Head network of two branches as
our baseline, referred to as “Baseline (Two branches)”.

We denote the proposed densely semantically aligned
(DSA) re-ID schemes under different settings/designs with
the preﬁx of “DSA”. “DSA(Two streams fused)” denotes
our two stream scheme which takes zG and zL as the match-
ing features for inference. In inference, the DSAG-Stream
can be discarded and we refer to it as “DSA-reID(Only MF-
Stream)”, which takes fG and fL as the matching features
and is our ﬁnal scheme, also named as “DSA-reID”.

We have

following observations/conclusions.
1) Our ﬁnal scheme achieves signiﬁcant performance

features.

Global and part-aware/part

For each
stream, we have two branches which focus on global
features and part features resepctively. We show the
analysis in Table 3.
1) “DSA-Global(Single)”/“DSA-
Local(Single)” denotes the design with only the global/local
branch in our two stream framework for both training and
inferencing.
“DSA-Global(Single)” outperforms “Base-
line(RE+LS)” by +1.4%/+3.5% in Rank-1/mAP accuracy.
“DSA-Local(Single)” outperforms “Baseline(RE+LS)” by
+0.6%/+2.0% in Rank-1/mAP accuracy. These demonstrate
that our semantic alignment design is very efﬁcient. 2)
Since global and part-aware/part features are complemen-
tary, our scheme with both the global and part-aware/part
branches, “DSA(Two streams fused)”, achieves additional
+1.0%/+2.8%, and +1.8%/+4.3% gain in comparison with
“DSA-Global(Single)” and “DSA-Local(Single)” in Rank-
1/mAP accuracy respectively. 3) “DSA-Global(Joint)” or
“DSA-Local(Joint)” denotes that the inference is based on
the features of the global branch or part-aware branch of our
scheme “DSA(Two stream fused)”, i.e., zG or zL. Thanks
to the joint training, “DSA-Global/Local(Joint)” signiﬁ-
cantly outperforms “DSA-Global/Local(Single)”.

Dense vs. coarse semantic alignment. Thanks to the
densely semantically aligned representation and our archi-
tecture design, our scheme achieves excellent performance.
We take the DSAP-images as input to the DSAG-Stream.
One may wonder about the performance if the cropped body
parts without internal ﬁne grained alignment are taken as in-
put to our framework. We conduct an experiment by replac-
ing the 24 DSAP-images by 24 cropped part images (with-
out alignment within a part region) and refer to this scheme
as coarsely semantically aligned re-ID, CSA. Table 4 shows
the performance comparisons. 1) Our densely semanti-
cally aligned scheme signiﬁcantly outperforms the coarsely

semantically aligned scheme by +1.6%/+3.5% in Rank-

2) Our coarsely semantically aligned
scheme still outperforms the baselines by a large margin,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our architecture design.
Two stream fusion designs. We investigate how to
make the MF-Stream and the DSAG-Stream interact efﬁ-
ciently for joint training and show the comparisons in Ta-
ble 5. “Concatenation+fc” denotes that for either branch,
the features from the MF-Stream and the DSAG-Stream are
concatenated followed by a fully connected layer. “Elem-
add” denotes that the features from the MF-Stream and
the DSAG-Stream are element-wisely added. “Concatina-
tion+fc” has poor performance. In contrast, our fusion with
element-wise add achieves excellent performance.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a densely semantically aligned
person re-ID framework, intending to address the ubiqui-
tous misalignment problems. Thanks to the estimated dense
semantics, it becomes possible to construct the densely se-
mantically aligned part images (DSAP-images) from the
2D image. We design a two stream network consisting of
the MF-Stream and the DSAG-Stream. Considering that
the DSAP-images have the inherent densely semantically
aligned merits, but are noisy due to semantics estimation
error, we treat the DSAG-Stream as a regulator to assist the
feature learning of the MF-Stream, through our fusion and
supervision designs. In the inference, only the MF-Stream
is needed, making the system more computationally efﬁ-
cient and robust. Our scheme achieves the best performance
on Market-1501, CUHK03, and CUHK01. On CUHK03,
our scheme signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous methods,
by at least +10.9%/+7.8% in Rank-1/mAP accuracy.
