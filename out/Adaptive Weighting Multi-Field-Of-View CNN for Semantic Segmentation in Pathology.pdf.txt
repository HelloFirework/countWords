Abstract

Automated digital histopathology image segmentation
is an important task to help pathologists diagnose tumors
and cancer subtypes. For pathological diagnosis of can-
cer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magniﬁca-
tion of whole-slide images (WSI) viewers. A key assump-
tion is that the importance of the magniﬁcations depends
on the characteristics of the input image, such as cancer
subtypes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic seg-
mentation method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-
of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can adaptively use image
features from images with different magniﬁcations to seg-
ment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image.
The proposed method aggregates several expert CNNs for
images of different magniﬁcations by adaptively changing
the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It
leverages information in the images with different magni-
ﬁcations that might be useful for identifying the subtypes.
It outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in experi-
ments.

1. Introduction

Automated digital pathology image analysis is an im-
portant task to help pathologists diagnose tumors and can-
cer subtypes.
In particular, many segmentation methods,
such as for segmenting tumor regions, have been proposed.
The state-of-the-art methods accurately distinguish regions
(normal and tumor) in digital pathology images [7][42][43].
Recent progress in medicine has emphasized, the impor-
tance of cancer subtype analysis in histology. For example,
Yoshizawa et al. [45] showed that knowledge of lung adeno-
carcinoma subtypes could be used to predict the prognosis
of a patient who underwent surgical resection statistically.
The development of multiple-subtype segmentation will be
important for pathological image analysis.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) [28] have been
used for classiﬁcation and segmentation tasks and they have
been shown to outperform traditional computer vision tech-

tions; Top: 5x, Middle: 10x, Bottom: 20x. The columns indicate

niques in various applications. Whole-slide images (WSI),
which are often used in digital pathology, cannot be inputted
to a CNN because they are so large (e.g., 100,000 × 50,000
pixels) compared with a natural image (i.e., WSI is over
10000 times the size of a natural image). Therefore, most
methods take a patch-based classiﬁcation approach that ﬁrst
segments a large image into small patches and then classi-
ﬁes each patch [40]. However, a small patch image has less
context of a wide range of texture patterns that might be
useful for classiﬁcation. In order to extend the ﬁeld of view
under the size limit, the input image is usually downsam-
pled. As a result, the spatial resolution is reduced (Figure 1).
This trade-off between the size of the ﬁeld of view and the
resolution of the input image makes it difﬁcult to segment
cancer subtypes from an input patch image.

On the other hand,

to make pathological diagnoses,
pathologists usually check images by changing their mag-
niﬁcation in WSI viewers (i.e., they use several different
scaled images). They can check a wide range of texture pat-

magniﬁcation images to check details, such as the shapes of
individual cells that are too small to be clearly seen in the
low-resolution images (Figure 1). It means that it is impor-
tant for diagnosis to use both of high-resolution images with
the narrow ﬁeld of view and low-resolution images with the
wide ﬁeld of view. A key assumption is that the impor-
tance of the magniﬁcations depends on the characteristic of
the input image. For example in Figure 1, images with a
wide ﬁeld of view (top) have more discriminative features
than the narrow ﬁeld of view with high-resolution (bottom)
for distinguishing acinar/papillary and lepidic subtypes. On
the other hand, high-resolution images (bottom) have more
discriminative features than the wide ﬁeld of view (top) for
distinguishing normal and lepidic subtypes. This indicates
that it is important to adaptively use the images with differ-
ent magniﬁcation depending on the input image.

In summary, the main contributions of our study are:

• We propose a semantic segmentation method that can
aggregate contextual information from multiple mag-
niﬁcation images by adaptively weighting several seg-
mentation networks (expert CNNs) that are trained us-
ing different-magniﬁcation images. Our method lever-
ages the contexts from both wide ﬁeld-of-view and
high-resolution images that might be useful for iden-
tifying the subtypes.

• Our end-to-end learning re-trains the expert CNNs so
that all experts work complementarily to increase the
cases that either expert can predict a correct answer,
and trains an aggregating CNN to be able to adaptively
aggregate the predicted results. This contributes to im-
proving the segmentation performance. We also an-
alyzed the effectiveness of the learning by comparing
the prediction results of experts between the before and
after the end-to-end learning.

• We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a
challenging task; segmentation of subtype regions of
lung adenocarcinomas. Our method outperformed the
state-of-art methods, in particular, in a multi-class seg-
mentation task. We also show that our method can be
applied to any type of network.

2. Related works

Many methods have been proposed for pattern recogni-
tion tasks in pathology: Patient-level and WSI-level pN-
stage estimation (CAMELYON 2016 and 2017) [4][5], and
segmentation of tumors. Segmentation methods distinguish
the tumor regions from normal regions in a pathological im-
age (WSI), and they can be roughly classiﬁed into patch-
wise classiﬁcations and pixel-wise semantic segmentations.
Patch-based approach: The patch-based methods segment
the large WSI into small image patches and then classify

each patch image [2][6][13][33][41][49]. Wang et al. [40]
used a CNN to extract features from each patch and assign
a prediction score. They performed breast metastasis can-
cer detection based on the predicted score map in WSIs of
sentinel lymph node biopsies. Hou et al.[19] proposed an
EM-based classiﬁcation method with a CNN that automat-
ically identiﬁes discriminative patches by utilizing the spa-
tial relationships of patches. It was used to classify glioma
and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. As
discussed in the introduction, contextual information from
image features of a ﬁxed patch size is not enough to identify
the cancer type. To address this shortcoming, several meth-
ods that incorporate multi-scale contextual information into
a patch-wise classiﬁcation have been proposed [1][27][38].
These methods are efﬁcient for rough segmentation (i.e.,
patch-level segmentation). To obtain the pixel-level seg-
mentation, the sliding window strategy is required. One
of the drawbacks is its slowness; the classiﬁcation process
must be run separately on each pixel, and there is a lot of
redundancy due to overlapping patches.

Semantic Segmentation: To overcome the above short-
coming, FCN produces a segmentation mask image with
high resolution; its architecture consists of downsampling
layers for extracting image features and upsampling lay-
ers for obtaining a segmentation mask [32]. U-net [36] is
widely used for segmentation problems; it introduces skip
connections from downsampling layers to upsampling lay-
ers to preserve the information in high-resolution images.
This network won the ISBI challenge 2015 for segmentation
of neuronal structures in electron microscopy. Many se-
mantic segmentation methods have been proposed for nat-
ural image analysis [18][26][44].
In particular, graphical
model [8][22][48][39], spatial pyramid pooling [8][9][47],
dilated convolution [46] and multi-scale inputs (i.e., image
pyramid) [8][10][17][31][34] exploit contextual informa-
tion for segmentation. These models have shown promis-
ing results on several segmentation benchmarks by aggre-
gating multi-scale information. They assume that an entire
image can be inputted to a single network; the entire im-
age is scaled to change the range of feature extraction. In
this scaling, where the ﬁeld-of-view of the scaled images
are same. However, as we discussed in the introduction, the
trade-off between spatial resolution and the size of the ﬁeld
of view remains a problem for semantic segmentation in
pathology because WSIs are huge and the input to a single
network is limited due to the size of the GPU memory size.
In this study, we incorporate multi-ﬁeld-of-view and multi-
resolution contextual information into a pixel-wise seman-
tic segmentation scheme.

Weighting (Gating): We propose an aggregation method
that can adaptively weight multiple CNNs trained with dif-
ferent ﬁeld-of-view images. There are several methods that
can adaptively weight the effective channels [20], pixels (lo-

12598

cation) [30], and scales [15][35] in a single network. Hu
et al. [20] proposed SENet which adaptively weights the
channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling in-
terdependencies between channels. Their network improves
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Sam et al. [37]
proposed a hard-switch-CNN network that chooses a single
optimal regressor from among several independent regres-
sors. It was used for counting the number of people in patch
images. Kumagai et al. [29] proposed a mixture of counting
CNNs for the regression problem of estimating the number
of people in an image.

The studies most related to ours are follows. Alsubaie
et al. [1] proposed a multi-resolution method that simply
inputs multi-ﬁeld-of-view images as multi-channels into a
single network. The method has slightly higher accuracy
compared with that of a single scale network. Sirinukun-
wattana et al. [38] systematically compared different archi-
tectures. They trained each CNN on images with different
magniﬁcations, and then fused the results from the CNNs
in several ways, such as CNN, LSTM, to obtain the ﬁnal re-
sults. These methods are for classifying patch images; they
cannot be directly applied to semantic segmentation CNNs.
In addition, they do not take into account that the impor-
tance of the magniﬁcations depends on an input image.

Unlike these current methods, our novel neural network
architecture and learning algorithm can adaptively use the
features from the multi-ﬁeld-of-view images depending on
the characteristic of the input image for semantic segmenta-
tion in pathology.

3. Effect of ﬁeld of view

In this section, we will investigate how the contextual
information (resolution and ﬁeld-of-view) is related to the
discriminative features for segmenting cancer subtypes. We
compared the outputs from CNNs that were trained individ-
ually using images with different magniﬁcations (20x, 10x,
5x) that have a trade-off between their resolution and the
ﬁeld-of-view size.

In the experiment, we used lung adenocarcinoma images
annotated by pathologists. We trained expert networks 1, 2
and 3 by using images with the different magniﬁcations as
shown in the top, middle and bottom row in Figure 1 respec-
tively. The details of the dataset and setup are described in
Section 5.

In Figure 2, a circle indicates a set of pixels that an ex-
pert correctly predicted, and the value indicates the ratio of
pixels correctly predicted to all pixels. The overlap region
of the three experts indicates the set of pixels that all ex-
perts correctly predicted. The non-overlap region indicates
the pixels that only one expert correctly predicted. Union
indicates the set of pixels that either expert predicted a cor-
rect class. This Venn diagram shows the similarity of the
predicted results of the expert networks.

pre-trained expert CNNs on two-class (left) and multi-class (right)
segmentation tasks.

The left ﬁgure showing the results of the two-class seg-
mentation task indicates that the experts gave very similar
results. The right ﬁgure showing the results of the multi-
class segmentation task indicates that the non-overlap ar-
eas were large, and thus, the union of the experts was much
larger than a single expert (by over 15%). This indicates that
the contextual information from different-magniﬁcation im-
ages is effective for multiple subtype semantic segmentation
(i.e., our assumption that the importance of the magniﬁca-
tions depends on an input image is reasonable.).

These results indicate that if a method can adaptively ag-
gregate experts depending on the characteristic of the in-
put image, the method can outperform the single experts, in
which the accuracy is expected to close to the accuracy of
the union of the experts. In addition, if a method can re-
train the experts so that each expert is specialized to make
the difference large and the size of the union increases, the
method will be able to outperform than the union of the
original individual experts. To achieve this goal, we select
the mixture of experts approach that aggregates the expert
CNNs for different-magniﬁcation images while adaptively
changing the weight of each CNN depending on the input
image. The details of this method are presented in the next
section.

Figure 3 shows an overview of our Adaptive-Weighting-
Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN). To address the
trade-off between the resolution and the size of the ﬁeld of
view, we use three different-magniﬁcation images Xi (X 1
i
for 20x, X 2
i for 5x) as inputs, where each input
image has different spatial resolutions and ﬁelds of view. i
indicates an index of an image data set. Here, X 1

highest spatial resolution with the narrowest ﬁeld of view.

using the peripheral context i.e., image features from the
outer regions of the target area (outside of the red box). The
outputs of these experts are aggregated on the aggregating
CNN to produce the ﬁnal results.

Under the assumption that the importance of magniﬁca-
tion images differ depending on the input image, we devel-
oped a weighting CNN that adaptively estimates the weights
of the expert CNNs by using the input images. We modi-
ﬁed Xception [11] (developed by Google) for classiﬁcation
by replacing the fully connected (FC) layers with global av-
erage pooling, a 3-class FC layer, and a sigmoid activation
function to output three weights and ﬁne-tuned the network
by using the trained parameters for 1000-class classiﬁcation
as the initial values. The range of each weight is 0 to 1.

The aggregating CNN concatenates the outputs of expert
CNNs with the estimated weights. This network outputs the
ﬁnal segmentation result of the target region. It has a sim-
ple architecture consisting of ﬁve convolutional layers and a
softmax function as shown in Figure 3. Each convolutional
layer except for the last is followed by a batch normaliza-
tion [21] and an exponential linear unit function [12].

Our AWMF-CNN consists of three types of network:
expert CNNs (fE1 , fE2 , fE3 ), a weighting CNN fW , and
an aggregating CNN fA as shown in Figure 3. We use
the U-net architecture [25][36] for each expert CNN. The
CNNs are trained such that each one becomes specialized
for segmenting images of a particular magniﬁcation in pre-
training. Each channel image in the output layer of each
network is a heat map of the likelihood of each subtype in
the target region, where the number of the output channels
equals the number of subtypes to be segmented. Since the
ﬁeld of views in X i

target region X i
1, the target region (red box) of each output
heat map is cropped and upsampled to the same size as the

This training algorithm is run until the maximum epoch
or convergence. Through it, each expert CNN becomes spe-
cialized for images in which the magniﬁcation is useful for
segmentation. The weighting CNN is trained to estimate
the weights of the specialized experts depending on an input
image. The aggregating CNN is trained to estimate the ﬁnal
segmentation results of the target area, which aggregates the
experts using the estimated weights. Given a test image, the
trained weighting CNN ﬁrst estimates the weights, and then
the trained integrated network predicts the ﬁnal segmenta-
tion result.

5. Experiments

We evaluated our method on two segmentation problems
from whole slide images (WSI), including two-class seg-
mentation into tumor and normal, and multi-subtype seg-
mentation in lung adenocarcinoma. For these experiments,
we compared the segmentation accuracy with the following
state-of-the-art methods: U-net [25][36], SegNet [3][24],
Dilated-net [46], DeepLabv3+ [9][23], and Hard-Switch-
CNN (HS) [37] that adaptively selects an expert net-
work (does not aggregate multiple images). For the pro-
posed method, we evaluated two versions: Ours (Adaptive)
is Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View CNN (AWMF-
CNN), and Ours (Fixed) is the Multi-Field-of-View CNN
that uses the ﬁxed weight 1.0 for aggregation, where the
other setup was same as AWMF-CNN.

i,c|k = 1, ..., 3, c = 1, ..., M }Nx

stride size was 256 pixels, and the magniﬁcations were
(20x, 10x, 5x)2. The corresponding scaled annotation mask
images {T k
i=1 were used for
the label data. The image patches were randomly ﬂipped
along the horizontal axis and vertical axis for data augmen-
tation. We experimented using ﬁve-fold cross-validation;
the 29 WSIs were divided into ﬁve sets. After that, each
WSI image was split into image patches. The image patches
of one set were used in the test, and the other patches were
used for training. We used 167,766 image patches for train-
ing the two-class segmentation and 20,848 image patches
for training four-class segmentation.The class ratios of the
training images were [Normal, Tumor] = [0.67, 0.33] and
[Lepidic, Acinar/Papillary, Micro Papillary, Solid] = [0.25,
0.29, 0.23, 0.23] at 20x magniﬁcation. Twenty percent of
the randomly selected training data was used as validation
data to prevent overﬁtting. This validation data was also
used as the training data X ′ for the weighting CNN. In
the weighting CNN, we used the second magniﬁcation im-
ages as the inputs in all experiments because this setup was
slightly better than the case when all magniﬁcation images
were used. The ﬁve-fold data set was used to evaluate all the
compared methods. We used Nadam optimizer [16] with a
learning rate of 10−4. The optimization was performed un-
til 50 epochs or convergence.

5.3. Experimental results

Images of sliced lung adenocarcinoma stained by hema-
toxylin and eosin (H&E) were captured using a virtual slide
scanner with a maximum magniﬁcation of 40x, and 29
WSIs were used in the experiments. All images were taken
from different patients and the sizes of the images were up
to 54, 000 × 108, 000. To generate the training and test data,
pathologists manually annotated the regions of ﬁve cancer
subtypes: 1. Normal, 2. Lepidic, 3. Acinar/Papillary1, 4.
Micropapillary, and 5. Solid, where ‘Normal’ indicates the
region of outside the tumors, and the other four classes are
tumor subtypes. To segment the images into multi-subtype
regions, they were ﬁrst segmented using the two-class seg-
mentation and the tumor regions were then segmented into
subtype regions. Figure 4 shows a typical WSI and the cor-
responding annotated mask image. Some of the tumor re-
gions cannot be identiﬁed with any subtype. These regions
are shown in black, so in total there are six classes (four
subtypes, normal and unclear labeled tumors).

5.2. Training

To train our AWMF-CNN model, we extracted a set
of three different-magniﬁcation patches {X 1
i=1,
corresponding to the same regions, from the WSIs (Fig-
ure 1), where the window size was 256 × 256 pixels, the

Figure 5 shows examples of the results in comparison.
These were generated by overlaying multi-subtype segmen-
tation results in the tumor region of the two-class seg-
mentation. The results of U-net, SegNet, Dilated-net, and
Hard-Switch-CNN contain many fragmented regions (Fig-
ure 5 (c), (d), (e), and (g)). Of the compared methods,
DeepLabv3+ (f) produced best results. Both of our meth-
ods gave better results than DeepLabv3+. Their results in
the two-class image segmentation task (Figure 5 (h) and (i))
were qualitatively similar, but the adaptive weight version
was better than the ﬁxed weight version in the semantic seg-
mentation task, as shown in the enlarged images of Figure 5.
We also evaluated three metrics; the overall pixel (OP)
accuracy, the mean of the per-class (PC) accuracy, and the
mean of the intersection over the union (mIoU) for two-
class and four-class segmentation tasks. These metrics [14]
are deﬁned as:

image features from the different-magniﬁcation images de-
pending on the input image. This made it more accurate
than the other methods.

The performance metrics of each method are shown in
Table 1 and 2.
In the two-class segmentation task, both
of our CNNs had better metrics in all case in comparison
with U-net, SegNet, Dilated-net, and Hard-Switch-CNN.
Their performance and that of the best ﬁeld of view (5x)
of DeepLabv3+ were not signiﬁcantly different. As shown
in the left image in Figure 2, each individual expert had high
accuracy by itself, and the results of these experts were very
similar. In this case, we consider that the adaptive weight-
ing strategy was not so effective, but the multi-ﬁeld-of-view
strategy improved the performance compared with those of
the individual experts. Consequently, we consider that our
methods had similar performance and were better than the
others.

In the multiple-subtypes

segmentation tasks, our
AWMF-CNN achieved the best performance and the ﬁxed
version was second best. The improvement was larger than
in the two-class segmentation task. As shown in the right
image in Figure 2, the results of these experts had the dif-
ferent regions and the union of the experts was much larger
than the region identiﬁed by a single expert. In this case,
we consider that our AWMF-CNN can adaptively use the

5.4. Changing expert CNNs in end to end training

Figure 6 shows the change in the correct answer rate
for individually pre-trained expert CNNs (top) and after the
end-to-end learning (bottom). Through end-to-end learn-
ing, the union of the prediction results of the experts be-
came large. In particular, the end-to-end learning more im-
proved the union of micro-papillary that had the smallest
union than the others. Although the circle of each expert
became small on average after the end-to-end learning, it is
considered that performance improved overall because all
experts work complementarily. Overall, the union of the
correct answer rates was 7% higher than that of the union
of the individual experts. We consider that this specializa-
tion of each expert by our model contributed to improving
the performance.

5.5. Varying expert networks

To demonstrate that our AWMF-CNN can be adapted to
any network, we trained it using U-net, SegNet, Dilated-
net, and DeepLabv3+ as the expert networks for the subtype
segmentation task; the training and test data sets were the

same as in the above experiments. Table 3 shows that ev-
ery AWMF-CNN trained by every type of expert was 3% to
16% more accurate than the corresponding individual net-
work with the best magniﬁcation that produced the highest
performance (Table 2).

6. Conclusion

We proposed a novel Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-
of-View CNN that can adaptively use image features from
different-magniﬁcation images depending on the input im-
age to segment multiple cancer subtype regions in pathol-
ogy. Our method mimics that pathologists check images
by changing their magniﬁcation adaptively depending on
the characteristic of the target image to make pathologi-
cal diagnoses. In experiments, we analyzed how each ex-
pert was specialized after the end-to-end learning; experts
were re-trained to work complementarily, as a result, it in-
creased the cases that either expert can predict a correct an-
swer. Our method outperformed state-of-the-art segmenta-

tion networks on multiple-subtypes segmentation tasks. We
also showed that it can be applied to any type of network.
In addition to magniﬁcations (experts), the importance of
subtypes (channels) and locations (pixels) may depend on
the characteristics of the input image. In the future work,
we will develop a method that can weight the combination
of magniﬁcations, subtypes, and locations.
