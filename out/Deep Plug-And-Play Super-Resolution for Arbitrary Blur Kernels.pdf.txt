Abstract

While deep neural networks (DNN) based single image
super-resolution (SISR) methods are rapidly gaining popu-
larity, they are mainly designed for the widely-used bicubic
degradation, and there still remains the fundamental chal-
lenge for them to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) image
with arbitrary blur kernels.
In the meanwhile, plug-and-
play image restoration has been recognized with high ﬂex-
ibility due to its modular structure for easy plug-in of de-
noiser priors. In this paper, we propose a principled for-
mulation and framework by extending bicubic degradation
based deep SISR with the help of plug-and-play framework
to handle LR images with arbitrary blur kernels. Speciﬁcal-
ly, we design a new SISR degradation model so as to take
advantage of existing blind deblurring methods for blur k-
ernel estimation. To optimize the new degradation induced
energy function, we then derive a plug-and-play algorith-
m via variable splitting technique, which allows us to plug
any super-resolver prior rather than the denoiser prior as a
modular part. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on
synthetic and real LR images demonstrate that the proposed
deep plug-and-play super-resolution framework is ﬂexible
and effective to deal with blurry LR images.

1. Introduction

Single image super-resolution (SISR), with the goal of
estimating the clean high-resolution (HR) counterpart x of
a given low-resolution (LR) image y, is a classical problem
with highly academic and practical values [3]. Basically, the
relationship between LR and HR images is characterized by
the degradation model which deﬁnes how the LR image is
degraded from an HR image. Empirical and theoretical s-
tudies have proven that an accurate degradation model is
crucial for the success of SISR [20, 60]. Thus, it is impor-
tant to ﬁrst review the degradation model for SISR.

In fact, most existing SISR methods are designed under
the assumption of certain degradation model. There are two
widely-used degradation models. The ﬁrst one, which is
acknowledged as a general degradation model for SISR, is
given by

y = (x ⊗ k) ↓s + n,

(1)
where x⊗ k represents the convolution between blur kernel
k and HR image x, ↓s is a subsequent downsampling oper-
ation with scale factor s, and n is additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) with noise level σ. Such degradation mod-
el has been extensively studied on developing model-based
optimization methods [13, 19]. However, these methods
mostly assume a priori known blur kernel which in prac-
tice is difﬁcult to estimate. Although several works such
as [41, 53] focus on estimating blur kernel, their source
codes are unfortunately not publicly available.

The second and perhaps the most widely-used one which

we refer to as bicubic degradation is formalized as

y = x ↓s .

(2)

Here, unless otherwise speciﬁed, ↓s instead represents the
bicubic downsampler (Matlab default function imresize)
with scale factor s. Due to its simplicity, bicubic degra-
dation model has become the benchmark setting to eval-
uate SISR methods [29, 36].
In particular, it greatly fa-
cilities the development of powerful deep neural networks
(DNN) for SISR [2]. However, such a simple degradation
inevitably gives rise to poor results in many practical sce-
narios [20, 65]. Nevertheless, little work has been done on
extending to more realistic degradation models.

Given the above considerations, it is very necessary to
address the following two issues: 1) designing an alterna-
tive degradation model, and 2) extending existing DNN-
based methods for bicubic degradation to the new degrada-
tion model so as to exploit the power of DNN. To this end,
we ﬁrst propose a simple yet effective degradation model
which assumes the LR image is a bicubicly downsampled,
blurred and noisy version of an HR image. Compared to the

1671

general degradation model given by Eqn. (1), the proposed
one offers two favorable merits. First, it generalizes the
well-studied bicubic degradation model given by Eqn. (2).
Second, it enables us to adopt the available blind deblurring
methods to estimate the blur kernel from the given LR im-
age. In order to extend DNN-based SISR methods to the
new degradation model, we propose a well-principled deep
plug-and-play super-resolution (DPSR) framework which
integrates DNN-based super-resolver into a variable split-
ting based iterative optimization scheme. It turns out that
the distortion of blur can be effectively handled in Fourier
domain. For this reason, it is possible to deal with arbi-
trary blur kernels, which is one of the main goals in this pa-
per. Moreover, different from existing plug-and-play frame-
work [13] which generally plugs the off-the-shelf Gaussian
denoiser as a modular part, the proposed instead achieves
the plug-in step by applying any existing DNN-based super-
resolvers with only a small modiﬁcation.

By far, it is worth emphasizing that we mainly focus
on non-blind SISR for arbitrary uniform blur kernels rather
than blind SISR for arbitrary non-uniform blur kernels. On
the one hand, non-blind SISR is important to blind SIS-
R which generally involves alternatively updating the blur
kernel and applying non-blind SISR to update the super-
resolved image. While some recent works attempt to train
DNN to directly estimate the clean image for blind deblur-
ring, their practicability needs further evaluations. On the
other hand, although the non-uniform blur kernel tends to
be a more realistic assumption, it is too complex and still
remains to be a difﬁcult problem for image deblurring [31].
In fact, the arbitrary uniform blur kernel assumption is al-
ready a much better choice than the simple bicubic kernel
for practical applications. Brieﬂy speaking, our work makes
a valuable intermediate step from existing bicubic degrada-
tion based SISR to ultimate blind SISR.

The contribution of this work is summarized as follows:

• A more realistic degradation model than bicubic degra-
dation model for SISR is proposed. It considers arbi-
trary blur kernels and enables to use existing deblur-
ring methods for blur kernel estimation.

• A deep plug-and-play super-resolution framework is
proposed to solve SISR with the new degradation mod-
el. DPSR is applicable beyond bicubic degradation and
can handle LR images with arbitrary blur kernels.

• The proposed DPSR is well-principled as the iterative
scheme aims to solve the new degradation induced en-
ergy function.

• The proposed DPSR extends existing plug-and-play
framework, showing that the plug-and-play prior for
SISR is not limited to Gaussian denoiser.

2.1. DNN based SISR

1) Bicubic degradation. The ﬁrst DNN-based SISR
method, termed as SRCNN [17], employs a relatively shal-
low network and follows the previous SISR methods such
as A+ [55] and ScSR [61] to synthesize LR images with
bicubic interpolation. Since then, by ﬁxing the degradation
model to bicubic degradation, some researchers began to
improve SISR performance via DNN from different aspect-
s, including PSNR and SSIM values, efﬁciency, and percep-
tual visual quality at a large scale factor.

To improve the SISR performance in terms of PSNR and
SSIM, the very deep super-resolution (VDSR) network pro-
posed by Kim et al. [29] shows that the most direct way is
to increase the network depth. However, VDSR operates on
the bicubicly interpolated LR images which hinders the efﬁ-
ciency. To that end, the FSRCNN [18] and ESPCN [50] are
proposed to directly manipulate the LR input and adopt an
upscaling operation at the end of the network. Considering
the fact that the visual results tend to be oversmoothed at
a large scale factor (e.g., 4), VGG [52] loss and generative
adversarial network (GAN) [24] loss are utilized to improve
the perceptual visual quality in [34, 49, 58].

While achieving great success on bicubic degrada-
tion [36, 44, 68], these methods perform poorly on most
of real images due to the mismatch of degradation models.

In [20],

2) Beyond bicubic degradation.
the authors
pointed out that an accurate estimate of the blur kernel is
more important than sophisticated image prior. Since then,
several attempts have been made to tackle with LR images
beyond bicubic degradation. Zhang et al. [63] proposed
a plug-and-play framework (IRCNN) to solve the energy
function induced by Eqn. (1). Although in theory IRCNN
can handle arbitrary blur kernel (please refer to [13]), the
blur kernel of such degradation model in practice is difﬁcult
to estimate. Zhang et al. [65] proposed a general DNN-
based solution (SRMD) which takes two key degradation
parameters as input. However, SRMD only considers the
Gaussian blur kernels. In [51], the authors proposed a zero-
shot super-resolution (ZSSR) method which trains image-
speciﬁc DNN on the testing LR image and can also take the
degradation parameters, such as the estimated blur kernel,
to improve the performance. While showing impressive re-
sults for LR image with internal repetitive structures, ZSSR
is less effective for severely blurred LR image.

As discussed, the above methods have two main draw-
backs. First, they have difﬁculty in blur kernel estimation.
Second, they are generally designed for Gaussian-like blur
kernel and thus cannot effectively handle severely blurred
LR image. It should be noted that a deep blind SISR method
for motion blur is proposed in [66]. However, it has limited
ability to handle the distortion of arbitrary blur kernels.

2.2. Plug and play image restoration

The plug-and-play image restoration which was ﬁrst in-
troduced in [15, 57, 69] has attracted signiﬁcant attention-
s due to its ﬂexibility and effectiveness in handling vari-
ous inverse problems. Its main idea is to unroll the energy
function by variable splitting technique and replace the pri-
or associated subproblem by any off-the-shelf Gaussian de-
noiser. Different from traditional image restoration method-
s which employ hand-crafted image priors, it can implicitly
deﬁne the plug-and-play prior by the denoiser. Remarkably,
the denoiser can be learned by DNN with large capability
which would give rise to promising performance.

During the past few years, a ﬂurry of plug-and-play
works have been developed from the following aspect-
s: 1) different variable splitting algorithms, such as half-
quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm [1], alternating di-
rection method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm [8],
FISTA [4], and primal-dual algorithm [11, 42]; 2) different
applications, such as Poisson denoising [47], demosaick-
ing [26], deblurring [56], super-resolution [9, 13, 28, 63],
and inpainting [40]; 3) different types of denoiser priors,
such as BM3D [14, 21], DNN-based denoisers [6, 62] and
their combinations [25]; and 4) theoretical analysis on the
convergence from the aspect of ﬁxed point [13, 37, 38] and
Nash equilibrium [10, 16, 45].

To the best of our knowledge, existing plug-and-play im-
age restoration methods mostly treat the Gaussian denoiser
as the prior. We will show that, for the application of plug-
and-play SISR, the prior is not limited to Gaussian denois-
er. Instead, a simple super-resolver prior can be employed
to solve a much more complex SISR problem.

3. Method

3.1. New degradation model

In order to ease the blur kernel estimation, we propose

the following degradation model

y = (x↓s) ⊗ k + n,

(3)

where ↓s is the bicubic downsampler with scale factor s.
Simply speaking, Eqn. (3) conveys that the LR image y is
a bicubicly downsampled, blurred and noisy version of a
clean HR image x.

Since existing methods widely use bicubic downsampler
to synthesize or augment LR image, it is a reasonable as-
sumption that bicubicly downsampled HR image (i.e., x↓s)
is also a clean image. Following this assumption, Eqn. (3)
actually corresponds to a deblurring problem followed by a
SISR problem with bicubic degradation. Thus, we can ful-
ly employ existing well-studied deblurring methods to es-
timate k. Clearly, this is a distinctive advantage over the
degradation model given by Eqn. (1).

Once the degradation model is deﬁned, the next step is
to formulate the energy function. According to Maximum
A Posteriori (MAP) probability, the energy function is for-
mally given by

min x

1
2σ2ky − (x↓s) ⊗ kk2 + λΦ(x),

(4)

where 1
2σ2ky− (x↓s)⊗ kk2 is the data ﬁdelity (likelihood)
term1 determined by the degradation model of Eqn. (3),
Φ(x) is the regularization (prior) term, and λ is the regu-
larization parameter. For discriminative learning method-
s, their inference models actually correspond to an energy
function where the degradation model is implicitly deﬁned
by the training LR and HR pairs. This explains why existing
DNN-based SISR methods trained on bicubic degradation
perform poorly for real images.

3.2. Deep plug and play SISR

To solve Eqn. (4), we ﬁrst adopt the variable splitting
technique to introduce an auxiliary variable z, leading to the
following equivalent constrained optimization formulation:

ˆx = arg min x

1
2σ2ky − z ⊗ kk2 + λΦ(x),
subject to z = x↓s .

(5)

We then address Eqn. (5) with half quadratic splitting
(HQS) algorithm. Note that other algorithms such as AD-
MM can also be exploited. We use HQS for its simplicity.

Typically, HQS tackles with Eqn. (5) by minimizing the
following problem which involves an additional quadratic
penalty term

1
2σ2ky−z⊗kk2+λΦ(x)+

µ
2 kz−x↓sk2, (6)
Lµ(x, z) =
where µ is the penalty parameter, and a very large µ will
enforce z approximately equals to x↓s. Usually, µ varies in
a non-descending order during the following iterative solu-
tion to Eqn. (6)

(zk+1 = arg min zky − z⊗kk2 + µσ2kz − xk ↓sk2, (7)

µ
2 kzk+1 − x↓sk2 + λΦ(x).

xk+1 = arg min x

(8)

It can be seen that Eqn. (7) and Eqn. (8) are alternating min-
imization problems with respect to z and x, respectively. In
particular, by assuming the convolution is carried out with
circular boundary conditions, Eqn. (7) has a fast closed-
form solution

zk+1 = F −1 F(k)F(y) + µσ2F(xk ↓s)

F(k)F(k) + µσ2

! ,

(9)

1In order to facilitate and clarify the parameter setting, we empha-
size that, from the Bayesian viewpoint, the data ﬁdelity term should be

1

2σ

2 ky − (x ↓s) ⊗ kk2 rather than 1

2 ky − (x ↓s) ⊗ kk2.

1673

where F(·) and F −1(·) denote the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and inverse FFT, F(·) denotes complex conjugate of
F(·).
To analyze Eqn. (8) from a Bayesian perspective, we
rewrite it as follows

1

xk+1 = arg min x

2(p1/µ)2kzk+1 − x↓sk2 + λΦ(x).

(10)
Clearly, Eqn. (10) corresponds to super-resolving zk+1 with
a scale factor s by assuming zk+1 is bicubicly downsam-
pled from an HR image x, and then corrupted by AWGN

with noise levelp1/µ. From another viewpoint, Eqn. (10)

solves a super-resolution problem with the following simple
bicubic degradation model

y = x↓s + n.

(11)

As a result, one can plug DNN-based super-resolver trained
on the widely-used bicubic degradation with certain noise
levels to replace Eqn. (10). For brevity, Eqn. (8) and E-
qn. (10) can be further rewritten as

xk+1 = SR(zk+1, s,p1/µ).

(12)

we refer to it as super-resolver prior.

Since the prior term Φ(x) is implicitly deﬁned in SR(·),
So far, we have seen that the two sub-problems given
by Eqn. (7) and Eqn. (8) are relatively easy to solve.
In
fact, they also have clear interpretation. On the one hand,
since the blur kernel k is only involved in the closed-form
solution, Eqn. (7) addresses the distortion of blur. In other
words, it pulls the current estimation to a less blurry one.
On the other hand, Eqn. (8) maps the less blurry image to a
more clean HR image. After several alternating iterations,
it is expected that the ﬁnal reconstructed HR image contains
no blur and noise.

3.3. Deep super resolver prior

In order to take advantage of the merits of DNN, we
need to specify the super-resolver network which should
take the noise level as input according to Eqn. (12). Inspired
by [23, 64], we only need to modify most of the existing
DNN-based super-resolvers by taking an additional noise
level map as input. Alternatively, one can directly adopt S-
RMD as the super-resolver prior because its input already
contains the noise level map.

Since SRResNet [34] is a well-known DNN-based super-
resolver, in this paper we propose a modiﬁed SRResNet,
namely SRResNet+, to plug in the proposed DPSR frame-
work. SRResNet+ differs from SRResNet in several aspect-
s. First, SRResNet+ additionally takes a noise level map M
as input. Second, SRResNet+ increases the number of fea-
ture maps from 64 to 96. Third, SRResNet+ removes the
batch normalization layer [27] as suggested in [58].

Before training a separate SRResNet+ model for each
scale factor, we need to synthesize the LR image and it-
s noise level map from a given HR image. According to
the degradation model given by Eqn. (11), the LR image
is bicubicly downsampled from an HR image, and then cor-
rupted by AWGN with a noise level σ from predeﬁned noise
level range. For the corresponding noise level map, it has
the same spatial size of LR image and all the elements are σ.
Following [65], we set the noise level range to [0, 50]. For
the HR images, we choose the 800 training images from
DIV2K dataset [2].

We adopt Adam algorithm [30] to optimize SRResNet+
by minimizing the ℓ1 loss function. The leaning rate starts
from 10−4, then decreases by half every 5 × 105 iterations
and ﬁnally ends once it is smaller than 10−7. The mini-
batch size is set to 16. The patch size of LR input is set
to 48×48. The rotation and ﬂip based data augmentation
is performed during training. We train the models with Py-
Torch on a single GTX 1080 Ti GPU.

Since this work mainly focuses on SISR with arbitrary
blur kernels. We omit the comparison between SRResNet+
and other methods on bicubic degradation. As a simple
comparison, SRResNet+ can outperform SRResNet [34] by
an average PSNR gain of 0.15dB on Set5 [5].

3.4. Comparison with related methods

In this section, we emphasize the fundamental differ-
ences between the proposed DPSR and several closely re-
lated DNN-based methods.

1) Cascaded deblurring and SISR. To super-resolve L-
R image with arbitrary blur kernels, a heuristic method is
to perform deblurring ﬁrst and then super-resolve the de-
blurred LR image. However, such a cascaded two-step
method suffers from the drawback that the perturbation er-
ror of the ﬁrst step would be ampliﬁed at the second step.
On the contrary, DPSR optimizes the energy function given
by Eqn. (4) in an iterative manner. Thus, DPSR tends to
deliver better performance.

2) Fine-tuned SISR model with more training data. Per-
haps the most straightforward way is to ﬁne-tune existing
bicubic degradation based SISR models with more train-
ing data generated by the new degradation model (i.e., E-
qn. (3)), resulting in the so-called blind SISR. However, the
performance of such methods deteriorates seriously espe-
cially when large complex blur kernels are considered, pos-
sibly because the distortion of blur would further aggravate
the pixel-wise average problem [34]. As for DPSR, it takes
the blur kernel as input and can effectively handle the dis-
tortion of blur via Eqn. (9).

3) Extended SRMD or DPSR with end-to-end training.
Inspired by SRMD [65], one may attempt to extend it by
considering arbitrary blur kernels. However, it is difﬁcult

1674

to sample enough blur kernels to cover the large kernel s-
pace. In addition, it would require a large amount of time
to train a reliable model. By contrast, DPSR only needs to
train the models on the bicubic degradation, thus it involves
much less training time. Furthermore, while SRMD can ef-
fectively handle the simple Gaussian kernels of size 15× 15
with many successive convolutional layers, it loses effec-
tiveness to deal with large complex blur kernels. Instead,
DPSR adopts a more concise and specialized modular by
FFT via Eqn. (9) to eliminate the distortion of blur. Alter-
natively, one may take advantage of the structure beneﬁts of
DPSR and resort to jointly training DPSR in an end-to-end
manner. However, we leave this to our future work.

From the above discussions, we can conclude that our
DPSR is well-principled, structurally simple, highly inter-
pretable and involves less training.

4. Experiments

4.1. Synthetic LR images

Following the common setting in most of image restora-
tion literature, we use synthetic data with ground-truth to
quantitatively analyze the proposed DPSR, as well as mak-
ing a relatively fair comparison with other competing meth-
ods.

Blur kernel. For the sake of thoroughly evaluating the ef-
fectiveness of the proposed DPSR for arbitrary blur kernels,
we consider three types of widely-used blur kernels, includ-
ing Gaussian blur kernels, motion blur kernels, and disk
(out-of-focus) blur kernels [12, 59]. The speciﬁcations of
the blur kernels are given in Table 1. Some kernel examples
are shown in Fig. 1. Note that the kernel sizes range from
5×5 to 35×35. As shown in Table 2, we further consid-
er Gaussian noise with two different noise levels, i.e., 2.55
(1%) and 7.65 (3%), for scale factor 3.

Parameter setting.
In the alternating iterations between
Eqn. (7) and Eqn. (8), we need to set λ and tune µ to ob-
tain a satisfying performance. Setting such parameters has
been considered as a non-trivial task [46]. However, the
parameter setting of DPSR is generally easy with the fol-
lowing two principles. First, since λ is ﬁxed and can be
absorbed into σ, we can instead multiply σ by a scalar √λ
and therefore ignore the λ in Eqn. (8). Second, since µ has
a non-descending order during iterations, we can instead

to indirectly determine µ in each iteration. Empirically, a
good rule of thumb is to set λ to 1/3 and exponentially de-

set the p1/µ from Eqn. (12) with a non-ascending order
crease p1/µ from 49 to a small σ-dependent value (e.g.,

max(2.55, σ)) for a total of 15 iterations.

Compared methods. We compare the proposed DPSR
with six methods, including two representative DNN-based
methods for bicubic degradation (i.e., VDSR [29] and R-
CAN [67]), two cascaded deblurring and SISR method-
s (i.e., IRCNN+RCAN and DeblurGAN+RCAN), and t-
wo specially designed methods for blurry LR images (i.e.,
GFN [66] and ZSSR [51]). To be speciﬁc, VDSR is
the ﬁrst very deep network for SISR; RCAN consists of
more than 400 layers and achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance for bicubic degradation; IRCNN is a plug-and-play
method with deep denoiser prior that can handle non-blind
image deblurring; DeblurGAN [32] is a deep blind de-
blurring method based on generative adversarial network
(GAN) [24]; GFN is a DNN-based method for joint blind
motion deblurring and super-resolution; ZSSR is an unsu-
pervised DNN-based method that can super-resolve blurry
and noisy LR images. Note that IRCNN, ZSSR and DP-
SR can take the blur kernel and noise level as input. For a
fair comparison, we modify ZSSR to our new degradation
model.

Quantitative results. The PSNR and SSIM results of dif-
ferent methods for different degradation settings on the col-
or BSD68 dataset [39, 48, 62] are shown in Table 2, from
which we have several observations. First, while RCAN
outperforms VDSR by a large margin for bicubic degra-
dation (see [67]), it has comparable performance to VD-
SR and even bicubic interpolation for the complex degra-
dations settings. Such phenomenon has also been reported
in [51, 65]. Second, after a deblurring step by IRCNN, IRC-
NN+RCAN can signiﬁcantly improve the PSNR and SSIM
values. Third, DeblurGAN+RCAN and GFN give rise to
poor performance which may be attributed to the limited ca-
pability of successive convolutional layers in handling dis-
tortion of large complex blur. Fourth, ZSSR is less effective
for large complex blur kernels due to the lack of recurrence
property of the blurry LR image. Last, our DPSR achieves
the best performance since it directly optimizes the energy
function for the given degradation and can effectively han-
dle the distortion of blur via Eqn. (9).

Visual results. Fig. 2 shows the visual comparison of d-
ifferent methods for super-resolving LR image with Gaus-
sian blur by a scale factor of 4. As one can see, VDSR
and RCAN undoubtedly produce unpleasant results due to
the degradation mismatch. DeblurGAN+RCAN generates
very unpleasant artifacts and does not alleviate the blurri-
ness compared to the LR image. GFN does not perform
well and ZSSR is less effective for super-resolving the very
blurry LR image. While IRCNN+RCAN produces better
results than DeblurGAN+RCAN, GFN and ZSSR, it gener-
ates some noise-like artifacts which is possibly introduced
by IRCNN and then ampliﬁed by RCAN. In comparison,
our DPSR produces the most visually pleasant results.

consistently gives rise to the best visual results. Particular-
ly, although GFN can deal with the motion blur to some
degree, its visual result is signiﬁcantly inferior to those of
IRCNN+RCAN and DPSR. The underlying reason is that it
has limited ability to blindly handle the distortion of blur via
successive convolutional layers. We note that other learning
based methods (e.g., [54]) also suffer from such problem.

Convergence. Since our DPSR is a special case of plug-
and-play framework for SISR, one may refer to [10, 45] to
analyze the theoretical convergence. In this paper, we on-
ly provide an empirical evidence to show the convergence
of DPSR. Fig. 5 shows the convergence curves of the pro-
posed DPSR on image “102061” with respect to different
types of blur kernels and different noise levels. In Fig. 5(a),
we ﬁx the noise level to 0 and choose the third kernel for
each kernel type. In Fig. 5(b), we ﬁx the blur kernel to the
third Gaussian kernel and choose three different noise level-
s, including 0, 2.55 and 7.65. It can be observed that DPSR
converges very fast.

It is worth pointing out, in order to reduce the compu-
tational cost, our DPSR does not necessarily need iterative
solution for bicubic degradation since our adopted super-
resolver prior is already trained end-to-end on such degra-
dation. Obviously, this is also an advantage over existing
plug-and-play SISR. For the case of other degradations, the
run time of our DPSR mainly depends on the total number
of iterations. On a single GPU, it takes about 1.8 seconds
for DPSR to super-resolve an LR image of size 256×256 by
different scale factors. As a comparison, ZSSR spends 12,
14 and 18 seconds for scale factor 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
In practice, one can tune the total number of iterations to
balance the performance and speed.

Super-resolver prior with GAN.
In the above experi-
ments, SRResNet+ is trained by ℓ1 loss.
It is natural to
rise the question: does the proposed method perform well
if the super-resolver prior is trained with GAN loss? Fol-
lowing the training strategy of [58], we trained a SRGAN+
model for scale factor 4 by a weighted combination of L1
loss, VGG loss and GAN loss. For convenience, we refer to
the proposed method with SRGAN+ as DPSRGAN. In this
special case, we compare DPSRGAN with IRCNN+RCAN
and four GAN-related methods, including ESRGAN [58],
IRCNN+ESRGAN and RCAN+DeblurGAN.

Fig. 6. The visual comparison of different methods on “chip” with scale factor 4 (ﬁrst row), “frog” with scale factor 3 (second row) and
“colour” with scale factor 2 (third row). The estimated blur kernel is shown on the upper-left corner of the LR image. Note that we assume
the noisy image “frog” has no blur.

Fig. 4 shows the visual comparison of different method-
s. It can be seen that directly super-resolving the blurry LR
image by ESRGAN does not improve the visual quality. By
contrast, IRCNN+ESRGAN can deliver much better visual
results as the distortion of blur is handled by IRCNN. Mean-
while, it ampliﬁes the perturbation error of IRCNN, result-
ing in unpleasant visual artifacts. Although DeblurGAN is
designed to handle motion blur, RCAN+DeblurGAN does
not perform as well as expected. In comparison, our DPSR-
GAN produces the most visually pleasant HR images with
sharpness and naturalness.

4.2. LR images with estimated kernel

In this section, we focus on experiments on blurry LR
images with estimated blur kernel. Such experiments can
help to evaluate the feasibility of the new degradation mod-
el, the practicability and kernel sensitivity of the proposed
DPSR. It is especially noteworthy that we do not know the
HR ground-truth of the LR images.

Fig. 6 shows the visual comparison with state-of-the-
art SISR methods (i.e., RCAN [67], SRMD [63] and
ZSSR [51]) on classical image “chip” [22], noisy image
“frog” [33] and blurry image “colour” [43]. For the “chip”
and “colour”, the blur kernel is estimated by [43]. For the
noisy “frog”, we assume it has no blur and directly adopt
our super-resolver prior to obtain the HR image. Note that
once the blur kernel is estimated, our DPSR can reconstruct
HR images with different scale factors, whereas SRMD and
ZSSR with Eqn. (1) need to estimate a separate blur kernel
for each scale factor.

From Fig. 6, we can observe that RCAN has very limited
ability to deal with blur and noise because of its oversimpli-
ﬁed bicubic degradation model. With a more general degra-
dation model, SRMD and ZSSR yield better results than

RCAN on “chip” and “frog”. However, they cannot recover
the latent HR image for the blurry image “colour” which
is blurred by a large complex kernel. In comparison, our
DPSR gives rise to the most visually pleasant results. As a
result, our new degradation model is a feasible assumption
and DPSR is an attractive SISR method as it can handle a
wide variety of degradations.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a well-principled deep plug-
and-play super-resolution method for LR image with arbi-
trary blur kernels. We ﬁrst design an alternative degradation
model which can beneﬁt existing blind deblurring methods
for kernel estimation. We then solve the corresponding en-
ergy function via half quadratic splitting algorithm so as to
exploit the merits of plug-and-play framework. It turns out
we can explicitly handled the distortion of blur by a special-
ized modular. Such a distinctive merit actually enables the
proposed method to deal with arbitrary blur kernels. It also
turns out that we can plug super-resolver prior rather than
denoiser prior into the plug-and-play framework. As such,
we can fully exploit the advances of existing DNN-based
SISR methods to design and train the super-resolver prior.
Extensive experimental results demonstrated the feasibility
of the new degradation model and effectiveness of the pro-
posed method for super-resolving LR images with arbitrary
blur kernels.
