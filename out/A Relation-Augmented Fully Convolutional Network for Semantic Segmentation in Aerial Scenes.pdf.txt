Abstract

Most current semantic segmentation approaches fall
back on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). How-
ever, their use of convolution operations with local recep-
tive ﬁelds causes failures in modeling contextual spatial re-
lations. Prior works have sought to address this issue by
using graphical models or spatial propagation modules in
networks. But such models often fail to capture long-range
spatial relationships between entities, which leads to spa-
tially fragmented predictions. Moreover, recent works have
demonstrated that channel-wise information also acts a piv-
otal part in CNNs.
In this work, we introduce two sim-
ple yet effective network units, the spatial relation module
and the channel relation module, to learn and reason about
global relationships between any two spatial positions or
feature maps, and then produce relation-augmented feature
representations. The spatial and channel relation modules
are general and extensible, and can be used in a plug-and-
play fashion with the existing fully convolutional network
(FCN) framework. We evaluate relation module-equipped
networks on semantic segmentation tasks using two aerial
image datasets, which fundamentally depend on long-range
spatial relational reasoning. The networks achieve very
competitive results, bringing signicant improvements over
baselines.

1. Introduction

Semantic segmentation of an image involves a prob-
lem of inferring every pixel in the image with the se-
mantic category of the object to which it belongs. The
emergence of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
[19, 33, 12, 16, 1, 40] and massive amounts of labeled data
has brought signiﬁcant progress in this direction. How-
ever, although with more complicated and deeper networks
and more labeled samples, there is a technical hurdle in

the application of CNNs to semantic image segmentation—
contextual information.

It has been well recognized in the computer vision com-
munity for years that contextual information, or relation, is
capable of offering important cues for semantic segmenta-
tion tasks [11, 39]. For instance, spatial relations can be
considered semantic similarity relationships among regions
in an image. In addition, spatial relations also involve com-
patibility and incompatibility relationships, i.e., a vehicle is
likely to be driven or parked on pavements, and a piece of
lawn is unlikely to appear on the roof of a building. Unfor-
tunately, only convolution layers cannot model such spatial
relations due to their local valid receptive ﬁeld1.

Nevertheless, under some circumstances, spatial rela-

1Feature maps from deep CNNs like ResNet usually have large recep-
tive ﬁelds due to deep architectures, whereas the study of [43] has shown
that CNNs are apt to extract information mainly from smaller regions in
receptive ﬁelds, which are called valid receptive ﬁelds.

tions are of paramount importance, particularly when a re-
gion in an image exhibits signiﬁcant visual ambiguities. To
address this issue, several attempts have been made to intro-
duce spatial relations into networks by using either graphi-
cal models or spatial propagation networks. However, these
methods seek to capture global spatial relations implicitly
with a chain propagation way, whose effectiveness depends
heavily on the learning effect of long-term memorization.
Consequently, these models may not work well in some
cases like aerial scenes (see Figure 5 and Figure 6), in
which long-range spatial relations often exist (cf. Figure 1).
Hence, explicit modeling of long-range relations may pro-
vide additional crucial information but still remains under-
explored for semantic segmentation.

This work is inspired by the recent success of relation
networks in visual question answering [31], object detec-
tion [13], and activity recognition in videos [42]. Being able
to reason about relationships between entities is momentous
for intelligent decision-making. A relation network is capa-
ble of inferring relationships between an individual entity
(e.g., a patch in an image) and a set of other entities (e.g.,
all patches in the image) by agglomerating information. The
relations vary at both long-range and short-range scales and
are learned automatically, driven by tasks. Moreover, a re-
lation network can model dependencies between entities,
without making excessive assumptions on their feature dis-
tributions and locations.

In this work, our goal is to increase the representation
capacity of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for seman-
tic segmentation in aerial scenes by using relation modules:
describing relationships between observations in convolved
images and producing relation-augmented feature represen-
tations. Given that convolutions operate by blending spa-
tial and cross-channel information together, we capture re-
lations in both spatial and channel domains. More speciﬁ-
cally, two plug-and-play modules—a spatial relation mod-
ule and a channel relation module—are appended on top
of feature maps of an FCN to learn different aspects of
relations and then generate spatial relation-augmented and
channel relation-augmented features, respectively, for se-
mantic segmentation. By doing so, relationships between
any two spatial positions or feature maps can be modeled
and used to further enhance feature representations. Fur-
thermore, we study empirically two ways of integrating two
relation modules—serial and parallel.

Contributions. This work’s contributions are threefold.

• We propose a simple yet effective and interpretable
relation-augmented network that enables spatial and
channel relational reasoning in networks for semantic
segmentation on aerial imagery.

• A spatial relation module and a channel relation mod-
ule are devised to explicitly model global relations,

which are subsequently harnessed to produce spatial-
and channel-augmented features.

• We validate the effectiveness of our relation modules

through extensive ablation studies.

2. Related Work

Semantic segmentation of aerial imagery. Earlier stud-
ies [35] have focused on extracting useful low-level, hand-
crafted visual features and/or modeling mid-level semantic
features on local portions of images ([17, 26, 38, 27, 28, 44,
15] employ deep CNNs and have made a great leap towards
end-to-end aerial image parsing.
In addition, there are
numerous contests aiming at semantic segmentation from
overhead imagery recently, e.g., Kaggle2, SpaceNet3, and
DeepGlobal4.

Graphical models. There are many graphical model-based
methods being employed to achieve better semantic seg-
mentation results. For example, the work in [5] makes use
of a CRF as post-processing to improve the performance
of semantic segmentation. [41] and [22] further make the
CRF module differentiable and integrate it as a joint-trained
part within networks. Moreover, low-level visual cues, e.g.,
object contours, have also been considered structure infor-
mation [3, 4]. These approaches, however, are sensitive to
changes in appearance and expensive due to iterative infer-
ence processes required.

Spatial propagation networks. Learning spatial propaga-
tion with networks for semantic segmentation have attracted
high interests in recent years. In [25], the authors try to pre-
dict entities of an afﬁnity matrix directly by learning a CNN,
which presents a good segmentation performance, while the
afﬁnity is followed by a nondifferentiable solver for spectral
embedding, which results in the fact that the whole model
cannot be trained end-to-end. The authors of [20] train a
CNN model to learn a task-dependent afﬁnity matrix by
converting the modeling of afﬁnity to learning a local lin-
ear spatial propagation. Several recent works [18, 21, 6]
focus on the extension of this work. In [2, 29], spatial rela-
tions are modeled and reinforced via interlayer propagation.
[2] proposes an Inside-Outside Net (ION) where four inde-
pendent recurrent networks that move in four directions are
used to pass information along rows or columns. [29] uti-
lizes four slice-by-slice convolutions within feature maps,
enabling message passings between neighboring rows and
columns in a layer. The spatial propagation of these meth-
ods is serial in nature, and thus each position could only
receive information from its neighbors.

Relation networks. Recently, the authors of [31] propose a
relational reasoning network for the problem of visual ques-
tion answering, and this network achieves a super-human
performance. Later, [42] proposes a temporal relation net-
work to enable multi-scale temporal relational reasoning in
networks for video classiﬁcation tasks. In [13], the authors
propose an object relation module, which allows model-
ing relationships among sets of objects, for object detection
tasks. Our work is motivated by the recent success of these
works, but we focus on modeling spatial and channel rela-
tions in a CNN for semantic segmentation.

Unlike graphical model-based [9, 37] and spatial propa-
gation network-based methods, we explicitly take spatial re-
lations and channel relations into account, so that semantic
image segmentation could benet from short- and long-range
relational reasoning.

3. Our Approach

In this section, an overview of the proposed relational
context-aware network is given to present a comprehensive
picture. Afterwards, two key components, the spatial re-
lation module and the channel relation module, are intro-
duced, respectively. Finally, we describe the strategy of in-
tegrating these modules for semantic segmentation.

3.1. Overview

As illustrated in Fig. 2,

the proposed network takes
VGG-16 [34] as a backbone to extract multi-level features.
Outputs of conv3, conv4, and conv5 are fed into the chan-
nel and spatial relation modules (see Figure 2) for generat-
ing relation-augmented features. These features are subse-
quently fed into respective convolutional layers with 1 × 1
ﬁlters to squash the number of channels to the number of
categories. Finally, the convolved feature maps are upsam-
pled to a desired full resolution and element-wise added to
generate ﬁnal segmentation maps.

3.2. Spatial Relation Module

In order to capture global spatial relations, we employ a
spatial relation module, where the spatial relation is deﬁned
as a composite function with the following equation:

SR(xi, xj) = fφs (gθs (xi, xj)) .

(1)

Denote by X ∈ RC×H×W a random variable represent-
ing a set of feature maps. xi and xj are two feature-map
vectors and identiﬁed by spatial positions indices i and j.
The size of xi and xj is C × 1 × 1. To model a compact re-
lationship between these two feature-map vectors, we make
use of an embedding dot production as gθs instead of a mul-
tilayer perceptron (MLP), and the latter is commonly used
in relational reasoning modules [31, 42]. Particularly, gθs is
deﬁned as follows:

gθs (xi, xj) = us(xi)T vs(xj) ,

(2)

xi and vs(xj) = Wvs

where us(xi) = Wus
xj . Wus
and Wvs are weight matrices and can be learned during the
training phase. Considering computational efﬁciency, we
realize Eq. (2) in matrix format with the following steps:

1. Feature maps X are fed into two convolutional layers
with 1 × 1 ﬁlters to generate us(X) and vs(X), re-
spectively.

2. Then us(X) and vs(X) are reshaped (and transposed)

into HW × C and C × HW , correspondingly.

3. Eventually, the matrix multiplication of us(X) and
vs(X) is conducted to produce a HW × HW matrix,
which is further reshaped to form a spatial relation fea-
ture of size HW × H × W .

It is worth nothing that the spatial relation feature is not
further synthesized (e.g., summed up), as ﬁne-grained con-
textual characteristics are essential in semantic segmenta-
tion tasks. Afterwards, we select the ReLU function as fφs
to eliminate negative spatial relations.

However, relying barely on spatial relations leads to a
partial judgment. Therefore, we further blend the spatial
relation feature and original feature maps X as follows:

Xs = [X, SR(X)] .

(3)

12418

Here we simply use a concatenation operation, i.e., [·, ·],
to enhance original features with spatial relations. By doing
so, output features are abundant in global spatial relations,
while high-level semantic features are also preserved.

3.3. Channel Relation Module

Although the spatial relation module is capable of cap-
turing global contextual dependencies for identifying vari-
ous objects, misdiagnoses happen when objects share simi-
lar distribution patterns but vary in channel dimensionality.
In addition, a recent work [14] has shown the beneﬁt of en-
hancing channel encoding in a CNN for image classiﬁcation
tasks. Therefore, we propose a channel relation module to
model channel relations, which can be used to enhance fea-
ture discriminabilities in the channel domain. Similar to the
spatial relation module, we deﬁne the channel relation as a
composite function with the following equation:

CR(Xp, Xq) = fφc (gθc (Xp, Xq)) ,

(4)

is a set of

feature maps X =
where the input
{X1, X2, · · · , XC}, and Xp as well as Xq represents the
p-th and the q-th channels of X. Embedding dot production
is employed to be gθc , deﬁned as

gθc (Xp, Xq) = uc(GAP(Xp))T vc(GAP(Xq)) ,

(5)

for capturing global relationships between feature map
pairs, where GAP(·) denotes the global average pooling
function. Notably, considering that the preservation of spa-
tial structural information distracts the analysis of chan-
nel inter-dependencies, we adopt averages of Xp and Xq
as channel descriptors before performing dot production.
More speciﬁcally, we feed feature maps into a global aver-
age pooling layer for generating a set of channel descriptors
of size C × 1 × 1, and then exploit two convolutional layers
with 1×1 ﬁlters to produce uc(X) and vc(X), respectively.
Afterwards, an outer production is performed to generate a
C × C channel relation feature, where the element located
at (p, q) indicates gθc (Xp, Xq).

Furthermore, we emphasize class-relevant channel rela-
tions as well as suppress irrelevant channel dependencies by
adopting a softmax function as fφc , formulated as

With this design, the input features are enhanced with
channel relations and embedded with not only initial dis-
criminative channel properties but also global inter-channel
correlations. Eventually, Xc is reshaped to C × H × W and
fed into subsequent procedures.

3.4. Integration of Relation Modules

In order to jointly enjoy beneﬁts from spatial and chan-
nel relation modules, we further aggregate features Xs and
Xc to generate spatial and channel relation-augmented fea-
tures. As shown in Fig. 4, we investigate two integration
patterns, namely serial integration and parallel integration,
to blend Xs and Xc. For the former, we append the spa-
tial relation module to the channel relation module and in-
fer Xs from Xc instead of X, as presented in Eq. (1) and
Eq. (7). For the latter, spatial relation-augmented features
and channel relation-augmented features are obtained si-
multaneously and then aggregated by performing concate-
nation.
Inﬂuences of different strategies are discussed in
Section 4.2.

where we take Xp as an example. Consequently, a discrimi-
native channel relation map CR(X) can be obtained, where
each element represents the corresponding pairwise channel
relation.

To integrate CR(X) and original feature maps X, we
reshape X into a matrix of C × HW and employ a matrix
multiplication as follows:

Xc = X T CR(X) .

(7)

To verify the effectiveness of long-range relation mod-
eling in our network, aerial image datasets are used in ex-
periments. This is because aerial images are taken from
nadir view, and the spatial distribution/relation of objects in
these images is diverse and complicated, as shown in Fig-
ure 1. Thus, we perform experiments on two aerial image
semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen and
Potsdam datasets, and results are discussed in subsequent
sections.

4.1. Experimental Setup

Datasets. The Vaihingen dataset5 is composed of 33 aerial
images collected over a 1.38 km2 area of the city, Vaihin-
gen, with a spatial resolution of 9 cm. The average size of
each image is 2494 × 2064 pixels, and each of them has
three bands, corresponding to near infrared (NIR), red (R),
and green (G) wavelengths. Notably, DSMs, which indi-
cate the height of all object surfaces in an image, are also
provided as complementary data. Among these images, 16
of them are manually annotated with pixel-wise labels, and
each pixel is classiﬁed into one of six land cover classes.
Following the setup in [24, 36, 32, 27], we select 11 images
for training, and the remaining ﬁve images (image IDs: 11,
15, 28, 30, 34) are used to test our model.

The Potsdam dataset6 consists of 38 high resolution
aerial images, which covers an area of 3.42 km2, and each
aerial image is captured in four channels (NIR, R, G, and
blue (B)). The size of all images is 6000 × 6000 pixels,
which are annotated with pixels-level labels of six classes
as the Vaihingen dataset. The spatial resolution is 5 cm, and
coregistered DSMs are available as well. To train and eval-
uate networks, we utilize 10 images for training and build
the test set with the remaining images (image IDs: 02 11,
02 12, 04 10, 05 11, 06 07, 07 08, 07 10), which follows
the setup in [24, 32].

Implementation. The proposed network is initialized with
separate strategies with respect to two dominant compo-
nents:
the feature extraction module is initialized with
CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet dataset [7], while convolu-
tional layers in relation modules are initialized with a Glorot
uniform initializer. Notably, weights in the feature extrac-
tion module are trainable and ﬁne-tuned during the training
phase.

Regarding the used optimizer, we choose Nestrov

validation loss is saturated. The loss of our network is sim-
ply deﬁned as categorical cross-entropy. We implement the
network on TensorFlow and train it on one NVIDIA Tesla
P100 16GB GPU for 250k iterations. The size of the train-
ing batch is 5, and we stop training when the validation loss
fails to decrease.

Evaluation metric. To evaluate the performance of net-
works, we calculate F1 score with the following formula:

F1 = (1 + β 2) ·

precision · recall

β 2 · precision + recall

,

β = 1,

(8)

for each category. Furthermore, mean F1 score is computed
by averaging all F1 scores to assess models impartially. No-
tably, a large F1 score suggests a better result. Besides,
mean IoU (mIoU) and overall accuracy (OA) that indicates
overall pixel accuracy, are also calculated for a comprehen-
sive comparison with different models.

4.2. An Ablation Study for Relation Modules

In our network, spatial and channel relation modules are
employed to explore global relations in both spatial and
channel domains. To validate the effectiveness of these
modules, we perform ablation experiments (cf. Table 1).
Particularly, instead of being utilized simultaneously, spa-
tial and channel relation modules are embedded on top of
the backbone (i.e., VGG-16), respectively. Besides, we also
discuss different integration strategies (i.e., parallel and se-
rial) of relation modules in Table 1.

The ablation experiments are conducted on the Vaihin-
gen dataset. As can be seen in Table 1, relation modules
bring a signiﬁcant improvement as compared to the base-
line FCN (VGG-16), and various integration schemes lead

to a slight inﬂuence on the performance of our network. In
detailed, the use of only the channel relation module yields
a result of 87.24% in the mean F1 score, which brings
a 3.50% improvement. Meanwhile, RA-FCN with only
the spatial relation module outperforms the baseline by a
4.62% gain in the mean F1 score. In addition, we note that
squeeze-and-excitation module [14] can also model depen-
dencies between channels. However, in our experiments,
the proposed channel relation module performs better.

Moreover, by taking advantage of spatial relation-

augmented and channel relation-augmented features si-
multaneously, the performance of our network is further
boosted up. The parallel integration of relation modules
brings increments of 1.26% and 0.14% in the mean F1 score
with respect to RA-FCN-crm and RA-FCN-srm. Besides, a
serial aggregation strategy is discussed, and results demon-
strate that it behaves superiorly as compared to other mod-
els. To be more speciﬁc, such design achieves the highest
mean F1 score, 88.54%, as well as the highest overall accu-
racy, 89.23%. To conclude, spatial- and channel-augmented

features extracted from relation modules carry out not only
high-level semantics but also global relations in spatial and
channel dimensionalities, which reinforces the performance
of a network for semantic segmentation in aerial scenes.

4.3. Comparing with Existing Works

For a comprehensive evaluation, we compare our model
with six existing methods, including FCN [23], FCN with
fully connected CRF (FCN-dCRF) [5], spatial propagation
CNN (SCNN) [29], FCN with atrous convolution (Dilated
FCN) [5], FCN with feature rearrangement (FCN-FR) [24],
CNN with full patch labeling by learned upsampling (CNN-
FPL) [36], RotEqNet [27], PSPNet with VGG16 as back-
bone [40], and several traditional methods [10, 30].

Numerical results on the Vaihingen dataset are shown in

Table 2. It is demonstrated that RA-FCN outperforms other
methods in terms of mean F1 score, mean IoU, and overall
accuracy. Speciﬁcally, comparisons with FCN-dCRF and
SCNN, where RA-FCN-srm obtains increments of 4.98%
and 3.69% in mean F1 score, respectively, validate the high
performance of the spatial relation module in our network.
Besides, compared to FCN-FR, RA-FCN reaches improve-
ments of 1.96% and 1.57% in mean F1 score and overall ac-
curacy, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating the
spatial relation module and channel relation module. Fur-
thermore, per-class F1 scores are calculated to assess the
performance of recognizing different objects. It is notewor-
thy that our method remarkably surpasses other competi-
tors in identifying scattered cars for its capacity of capturing
long-range spatial relation.

4.4. Qualitative Results

Fig. 5 shows a few examples of segmentation results.
The second row demonstrates that networks with local re-
ceptive ﬁelds or relying on fully connected CRFs and spatial
propagation modules fail to recognize impervious surfaces
between two buildings, whereas our models make relatively
accurate predictions. This is mainly because in this scene,
the appearance of impervious surfaces is highly similar to
that of the right building, which leads to a misjudgment of
rival models. Thanks to the spatial relation module, RA-
FCN-srm or RA-FCN is able to effectively capture useful
visual cues from more remote regions in the image for an
accurate inference. Besides, examples in the third row il-
lustrate that RA-FCN is capable of identifying dispersively
distributed objects as expected.

4.5. Results on the Potsdam Dataset

In order to further validate the effectiveness of our net-
work, we conduct experiments on the Potsdam dataset, and
numerical results are shown in Table 3. The spatial relation
module contributes to improvements of 2.25% and 2.67% in
the mean F1 score with respect to FCN-dCRF and SCNN,
and the serial integration of both relation modules brings in-
crements of 1.39% and 1.54% in the mean F1 score, mean

IoU, and overall accuracy, respectively.

Moreover, qualitative results are presented in Figure 6.
As shown in the ﬁrst row, although low vegetation regions
comprise intricate local contextual information and are li-
able to be misidentiﬁed, RA-FCN obtains more accurate re-
sults in comparison with other methods due to its remark-
able capacity of exploiting global relations to solve visual
ambiguities. The fourth row illustrates that outliers, i.e., the
misclassiﬁed part of the building, can be eliminated by RA-
FCN, while it is not easy for other competitors. To provide a
thorough view of the performance of our network, we also
exhibit a large-scale aerial scene as well as semantic seg-
mentation results in Figure 7.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced two effective network
modules, namely the spatial relation module and the chan-
nel relation module, to enable relational reasoning in net-
works for semantic segmentation in aerial scenes. The com-
prehensive ablation experiments on aerial datasets where
long-range spatial relations exist suggest that both relation
modules have learned global relation information between
objects and feature maps. However, our understanding of
how these relation modules work for segmentation prob-
lems is preliminary and left as future works.
