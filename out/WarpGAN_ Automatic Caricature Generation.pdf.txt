Abstract

We propose, WarpGAN, a fully automatic network that
can generate caricatures given an input face photo. Be-
sides transferring rich texture styles, WarpGAN learns to
automatically predict a set of control points that can warp
the photo into a caricature, while preserving identity. We
introduce an identity-preserving adversarial loss that aids
the discriminator to distinguish between different subjects.
Moreover, WarpGAN allows customization of the gener-
ated caricatures by controlling the exaggeration extent and
the visual styles. Experimental results on a public domain
dataset, WebCaricature, show that WarpGAN is capable of
generating caricatures that not only preserve the identities
but also outputs a diverse set of caricatures for each in-
put photo. Five caricature experts suggest that caricatures
generated by WarpGAN are visually similar to hand-drawn
ones and only prominent facial features are exaggerated.

1. Introduction

acteristics are exaggerated in order to create a comic or
grotesque effect” [1]. Paradoxically, caricatures are images
with facial features that represent the face more than the
face itself. Compared to cartoons, which are 2D visual art
that try to re-render an object or even a scene in a usually
simpliﬁed artistic style, caricatures are portraits that have
exaggerated features of a certain persons or things. Some
example caricatures of two individuals are shown in Fig-
ure 1. The fascinating quality of caricatures is that even
with large amounts of distortion, the identity of person in
the caricature can still be easily recognized by humans. In
fact, studies have found that we can recognize caricatures
even more accurately than the original face images [2].

Caricature artists capture the most important facial fea-
tures, including the face and eye shapes, hair styles, etc.
Once an artist sketches a rough draft of the face, they will
start to exaggerate person-speciﬁc facial features towards a
larger deviation from an average face. Nowadays, artists
can create realistic caricatures through computer softwares
through: (1) warping the face photo to exaggerate the shape

A caricature is deﬁned as “a picture, description, or im-
itation of a person or a thing in which certain striking char-

and (2) re-rendering the texture style [3]. By mimicking
this process, researchers have been working on automatic
caricature generation [4, 5]. A majority of the studies fo-
cus on designing a good structural representation to warp
the image and change the face shape. However, neither
the identity information nor the texture differences between
a caricature and a face photo are taken into consideration.
In contrast, numerous works have made progress with deep
neural networks to transfer image styles [6, 7]. Still these
approaches merely focus on translating the texture style for-
going any changes in the facial features.

In this work, we aim to build a completely automated
system that can create new caricatures from photos by uti-
lizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gener-
ative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Different from previ-
ous works on caricature generation and style transfer, we
emphasize the following challenges in our paper:

• The caricature generation involves both texture

changes and shape deformation.

• The faces need to be exaggerated in a manner such that

they can still be recognized.

• Caricature samples exist in various visual and artistic

styles (see Figure 1).

In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a new
type of style transfer network, named WarpGAN, which de-
couples the shape deformation and texture rendering into
two tasks. Akin to a human operating an image processing
software, the generator in our system automatically predicts
a set of control points that warp the input face photo into
the closest resemblance to a caricature and also transfers
the texture style through non-linear ﬁltering. The discrim-
inator is trained via an identity-preserving adversarial loss
to distinguish between different identities and styles, and
encourages the generator to synthesize diverse caricatures
while automatically exaggerating facial features speciﬁc to
the identity. Experimental results show that compared to
state-of-the-art generation methods, WarpGAN allows for
texture update along with face deformation in the image
space, while preserving the identity. Compared to other
style transfer GANs [13, 7], our method not only permits a
transfer in texture style, but also deformation in shape. The
contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:

• A domain transfer network that decouples the texture
style and geometric shape by automatically estimating
a set of sparse control points to warp the images.

• A joint learning of texture style transfer and image

warping for domain transfer with adversarial loss.

• A quantitative evaluation through face recognition per-
formance shows that the proposed method retains iden-
tity information after transferring texture style and

In addition, we conducted two percep-
tual studies where ﬁve caricature experts suggest that
WarpGAN generates caricatures that are (1) visually
appealing, (2) realistic; where only the appropriate fa-
cial features are exaggerated, and (3) our method out-
performs the state-of-the-art.

2.1. Automatic Image Warping

Many works have been proposed to enhance the spa-
tial variability of neural networks via automatic warping.
Most of them warp images by predicting a set of global
transformation parameters [14, 16] or a dense deforma-
tion ﬁeld [17]. Parametric methods estimate a small num-
ber of global transformation parameters and therefore can-
not handle ﬁne-grained local warping while dense deforma-
tion needs to predict all the vertices in a deformation grid,
most of which are useless and hard to estimate. Cole et
al. [18] ﬁrst proposed to use spline interpolation in neu-
ral networks to allow control point-based warping, but their
method requires pre-detected landmarks as input. Several
recent works have attempted to combine image warping
with GANs to improve the spatial variability of the genera-
tor, however these methods either train the warping mod-
ule separately [15, 12], or need paired data as supervi-
sion [15, 19]. In comparison, our warping module can be
inserted as an enhancement of a normal generator and can
be trained as part of an end-to-end system without further

facial landmarks for generating caricatures.

modiﬁcation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
ﬁrst work on automatic image warping with self-predicted
control points using deep neural networks. An overview of
different warping methods are shown in Figure 2.

2.2. Style Transfer Networks

Stylizing images by transferring art characteristics has
been extensively studied in literature. Given the effec-
tive ability of CNNs to extract semantic features [20, 21,
22, 23], powerful style transfer networks have been devel-
oped. Gatys et al. [24] ﬁrst proposed a neural style trans-
fer method that uses a CNN to transfer the style content
from the style image to the content image. A limitation
of this method is that both the style and content images
are required to be similar in nature which is not the case
for caricatures. Using Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) [25, 26] for image synthesis has been a promis-
ing ﬁeld of study, where state-of-the-art results have been
demonstrated in applications ranging from text to image
translation [27], image inpainting [28], to image super-
resolution [23]. Domain Transfer Network [29], Cycle-
GAN [13], StarGAN [30], UNIT [6], and MUNIT [7] at-
tempt image translation with unpaired image sets. All of
these methods only use a de-convolutional network to con-
struct images from the latent space and perform poorly
on caricature generation due to the large spatial varia-
tion [11, 12].

2.3. Caricature Generation

Studies on caricature generation can be mainly classiﬁed
into three categories: deformation-based, texture-based and

methods with both. Traditional works mainly focused on
exaggerating face shapes by enlarging the deviation of the
given shape representation from average, such as 2D land-
marks or 3D meshes [8, 4, 5, 9], whose deformation capa-
bility is usually limited as shape modeling can only happen
in the representation space. Recently, with the success of
GANs, a few works have attempted to apply style transfer
networks to image-to-image caricature generation [10, 11].
However, their results suffer from poor visual quality be-
cause these networks are not suitable for problems with
large spatial variation. Cao et al. [12] recently proposed to
decouple texture rendering and geometric deformation with
two CycleGANs trained on image and landmark space, re-
spectively. But with their face shape modeled in the PCA
subspace of landmarks, they suffer from the same prob-
lem of the traditional deformation-based methods. In this
work, we propose an end-to-end system with a joint learn-
ing of texture rendering and geometric warping. Compared
with previous works, WarpGAN can model both shapes and
textures in the image space with ﬂexible spatial variability,
leading to better visual quality and more artistic shape ex-
aggeration. The differences between caricature generation
methods are summarized in Table 1.

Let xp ∈ Xp be images from the domain of face photos,
xc ∈ Xc be images from the caricature domain and s ∈ S
be the latent codes of texture styles. We aim to build a net-
work that transforms a photo image into a caricature by both
transferring its texture style and exaggerating its geometric
shape. Our system includes one deformable generator (see

are summarized in Table 2.

3.1. Generator

The proposed deformable generator in WarpGAN is
composed of three sub-networks: a content encoder Ec,
a decoder R and a warp controller. Given any image
x ∈ RH×W ×C , the encoder outputs a feature map Ec(x).
Here H, W and C are height, width and number of chan-
nels respectively. The content decoder takes Ec(x) and a
random latent style code s ∼ N (0, I) to render the given
image into an image R(Ec(x), s) of a certain style. The
warp controller estimates the control points and their dis-
placements to warp the rendered images. An overview of
the deformable generator is shown in Figure 3.

Texture Style Transfer Since there is a large variation
in the texture styles of caricatures images (See Figure 1),
we adopt an unsupervised method [7] to disentangle the
style representation from the feature map Ec(x) so that
we can transfer the input photo into different texture styles

present in the caricature domain. During the training, the
latent style code s ∼ N (0, I) is sampled randomly from
a normal distribution and passed as an input into the de-
coder R. A multi-layer perceptron in R decodes s to gener-
ate the parameters of the Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) layers in R, which have been shown to be effec-
tive in controlling visual styles [31]. The generated images
R(Ec(x), s) with random styles are then warped and passed
to the discriminator. Various styles obtained from Warp-
GAN can be seen in Figure 5.

To prevent Ec and R from losing semantic information
during texture rendering, we combine the identity mapping
loss [29] and reconstruction loss [7] to regularize Ec and
R.
In particular, a style encoder Es is used to learn the
mapping from the image space to the style space S. Given
its own style code, both photos and caricatures should be
reconstructed from the latent feature map:

idt = Ex

Automatic Image Warping The warp controller is a sub-
network of two fully connected layers. With latent fea-
ture map Ec(x) as input, the controller learns to estimate
k control points p = {p1, p2, ...., pk} and their displace-
ment vectors ∆p = {∆p1, ∆p2, ...∆pk}, where each pi
and ∆pi is a 2D vector in the u-v space. The points are
then fed into a differentiable warping module [18]. Let
p′ = {p′
k} be the destination points, where
p′
i = pi + ∆pi. A grid sampler of size H × W can then be
computed via thin-plate spline interpolation:

entire warping module is differentiable and can be trained
as part of an end-to-end system.

3.2. Discriminator

Patch Adversarial Loss We ﬁrst used a fully convolu-
tional network as a patch discriminator [7, 13]. The patch
discriminator is trained as a 3-class classiﬁer to enlarge the
difference between the styles of generated images and real
photos [29]. Let D1, D2 and D3 denote the logits for the
three classes of caricatures, photos and generated images,
respectively. The patch adversarial loss is as follows:

Identity-Preservation Adversarial Loss Although patch
discriminator is suitable for learning visual style transfer, it
fails to capture the distinguishing features of different iden-
tities. The exaggeration styles for different people could
actually be different based on their facial features (See Sec-
tion 4.3). To combine the identity-preservation and identity-
speciﬁc style learning, we propose to train the discriminator
as a 3M -class classiﬁer, where M is the number of identi-
ties. The ﬁrst, second, and third M classes correspond to
different identities of real photos, real caricatures and fake
caricatures, respectively. Let yp, yc ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...M } be the

Dataset We use the images from a public domain dataset,
WebCaricature [33]2, to conduct the experiments. The
dataset consists of 6, 042 caricatures and 5, 974 photos from
252 identities. We align all the images with ﬁve landmarks.
Then, the images are aligned through similarity transforma-
tion using the ﬁve landmarks and are resized to 256 × 256.
We randomly split the dataset into a training set of 126 iden-
tities (3, 016 photos and 3, 112 caricatures) and a testing set
of 126 identities (2, 958 photos and 2, 930 caricatures). All
the testing images in this paper are from identities in the
testing set.

Training Details We use ADAM optimizers in Tensor-
ﬂow with β1 = 0.5 and β2 = 0.9 for the whole network.
Each mini-batch consists of a random pair of photo and car-
icature. We train the network for 100, 000 steps. The learn-
ing rate starts with 0.0001 and is decreased linearly to 0
after 50, 000 steps. We empirically set λg = 1.0, λp = 2.0,
λidt = 10.0 and number of control points k = 16. We con-
duct all experiments using Tensorﬂow r1.9 and one Geforce
GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The average speed for generating one
caricature image on this GPU is 0.082s. The details of the
architecture are provided in the supplementary material.

plexity of this task, it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to train
them and they usually result in generating collapsed images.

4.2. Ablation Study

To analyze the function of different modules in our sys-
tem, we train three variants of WarpGAN for comparison
by removing Lg, Lp and Lidt, respectively. Figure 6 shows
a comparison of WarpGAN variants that include all the loss
functions. Without the proposed identity-preservation ad-
versarial loss, the discriminator only focuses on local tex-
ture styles and therefore the geometric warping fails to cap-
ture personal features and is close to randomness. Without
the patch adversarial loss, the discriminator mainly focuses
on facial shape and the model fails to learn diverse texture
styles. The model without identity mapping loss still per-
forms well in terms of texture rendering and shape exag-
geration. We keep the identity loss to improve the visual
quality of the generated images.

4.3. Shape Exaggeration Styles

Caricaturists usually deﬁne a set of prototypes of face
parts and have certain modes on how to exaggerate
them [34]. In WarpGAN we do not adopt any method to
exaggerate the facial regions explicitly, but instead we in-
troduce the identity preservation constraint as part of the
adversarial loss. This forces the network to exaggerate the
faces to be more distinctive from other identities and implic-
itly encourages the network to learn different exaggeration
styles for people with different salient features. Some ex-
ample exaggeration styles learned by the network are shown
in Figure 7.

and Multimodal UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation
(MUNIT) [7] for style transfer approaches3. We ﬁnd that
among all the three baseline style transfer networks, Cycle-
GAN and MUNIT demonstrate the most visually appealing
texture styles (see Figure 5). StarGAN and UNIT produce
very photo-like images with minimal or erroneous changes
in texture. Since all these networks focus only on transfer-
ring the texture styles, they fail to deform the faces into car-
icatures, unlike WarpGAN. The other issue with the base-
lines methods is that they do not have a module for warping
the images and therefore, they try to compensate for defor-
mations in the face using only texture. Due to the com-

4.4. Customizing the exaggeration

Although the WarpGAN is trained as a deterministic
model, we introduce a parameter α during deployment to al-
low customization of the exaggeration extent. Before warp-
ing, the displacement of control points ∆p will be scaled by
α to control how much the face shape will be exaggerated.
The results are shown in Figure 8. When α = 0.0, only the
texture is changed and α = 1.0 leads to the original output
of the WarpGAN. Even when changing α to 2.0, the result-
ing images appear as caricatures, but only the distinguishing
facial features are exaggerated. Since the texture styles are
learned in a disentangled way, WarpGAN can generate var-
ious texture styles. Figure 5 shows results from WarpGAN
with three randomly sampled styles.

Face Recognition In order to quantify identity preser-
vation accuracy for caricatures generated by WarpGAN,
we evaluate automatic face recognition performance us-
ing two state-of-the-art face matchers: (1) a Commercial-
Off-The-Shelf (COTS) matcher4 and (2) an open source
SphereFace [35] matcher.

An identiﬁcation experiment is conducted where one
photo of the identity is kept in the gallery while all remain-
ing photos, or all hand-drawn caricatures, or all synthesized
caricatures for the same identity are used as probes. We
evaluate the Rank-1 identiﬁcation accuracy using 10-fold
cross validation and report the mean and standard devia-
tion across the folds in Table 3. We ﬁnd that the gener-
ated caricatures can be matched to real face images with a
higher accuracy than hand-drawn caricatures. We also ob-
serve the same trend for both the matchers, which suggests
that recognition on synthesized caricatures is consistent and
matcher-independent.

Perceptual Study We conducted two perceptual studies
by recruiting 5 caricature artists who are experts in their
ﬁeld to compare hand-drawn caricatures with images syn-
thesized by our baselines along with our WarpGAN. A car-
icature is generated from a random image for each 126 sub-
jects in the WebCaricature testing set. The ﬁrst perceptual
study uses 30 of them and 96 are used for the second. Ex-
perts do not have any knowledge of the source of the cari-
catures and they rely solely on their perceptual judgment.

The ﬁrst study assesses the overall similarity of the gen-
erated caricatures to the hand-drawn ones. Each carica-
ture expert was shown a face photograph of a subject along
with three corresponding caricatures generated by Cycle-
GAN, MUNIT, and WarpGAN, respectively. The experts
then rank each of the three generated caricatures from “most
visually closer to a hand-drawn caricature” to “least similar
to a hand-drawn caricature”. We ﬁnd that caricatures gen-
erated by WarpGAN is ranked as the most similar to a real
caricature 99% of the time, compared to 0.5% and 0.5% for
CycleGAN and MUNIT, respectively.

In the second study, experts scored the generated cari-
catures according to two criteria: (i) visual quality, and (ii)
whether the caricatures are exaggerated in proper manner
where only prominent facial features are deformed. Experts
are shown three photographs of a subject along with a car-
icature image that can either be (i) a real hand-drawn car-
icature, or (ii) generated using one of the three automatic
style transfer methods. From Table 4 we ﬁnd that Warp-
GAN receives the best perceptual scores out of the three
methods. Even though hand-drawn caricatures rate higher,
our approach, WarpGAN, has made a tremendous leap in
automatically generating caricatures, especially when com-
pared to state-of-the-art.

Joint Rendering and Warping Learning Unlike other
visual style transfer tasks [29, 13, 7], transforming photos
into caricatures involves both texture difference and geo-
metric transition. Texture is import in exaggerating local
ﬁne-grained features such as depth of the wrinkles while
geometric deformation allows exaggeration of global fea-
tures such as face shape. Conventional style transfer net-
works [29, 13, 7] aims to reconstruct an image from feature
space using a decoder network. Because the decoder is a
stack of nonlinear local ﬁlters, they are intrinsically inﬂex-
ible in terms of spatial variation and the decoded images
usually suffer from poor quality and severe information loss
when there is a large geometric discrepancy between the in-
put and output domain. On the other hand, warping-based
methods are limited by nature to not being able to change
the content and ﬁne-grained details. Therefore, both style
transfer and warping module are necessary parts for our ad-
versarial learning framework. As shown in Figure 6, with-
out either module, the generator will not be able to close the
gap between photos and caricatures and the balance of com-
petition between generator and discriminator will be bro-
ken, leading to collapsed results.

Identity-preservation Adversarial Loss The discrimi-
nator in conventional GANs are usually trained as a bi-
nary [13] or ternary classiﬁers [29], with each class rep-
resenting a visual style. However, we found that because of
the large variation of shape exaggeration in the caricatures,
treating all the caricatures as one class in the discrimina-
tor would lead to the confusion of the generator, as shown
in Figure 6. However, we observe that caricaturists tend to
give similar exaggeration styles to the same person. There-
fore, we treat each identity-domain pair as a separate class
to reduce the difﬁculty of learning and also encourage the
identity-preservation after the shape exaggeration.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a new method of caricature
generation, namely WarpGAN, that addresses both style
transfer and face deformation in a joint learning frame-
work. Without explicitly requiring any facial landmarks,
the identity-preserving adversarial loss introduced in this
work appropriately learns to capture caricature artists’ style
while preserving the identity in the generated caricatures.
We evaluated the generated caricatures by matching syn-
thesized caricatures to real photos and observed that the
recognition accuracy is higher than caricatures drawn by
artists. Moreover, ﬁve caricature experts suggest that car-
icatures synthesized by WarpGAN are not only pleasing to
the eye, but are also realistic where only the appropriate fa-
cial features are exaggerated and that our WarpGAN indeed
outperforms the state-of-the-art networks.
