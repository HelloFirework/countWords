Abstract

The fundamental challenge of small inter-person vari-
ation requires Person Re-Identiﬁcation (Re-ID) models to
capture sufﬁcient ﬁne-grained features. This paper pro-
poses to discover diverse discriminative visual cues with-
out extra assistance, e.g., pose estimation, human parsing.
Speciﬁcally, a Class Activation Maps (CAM) augmenta-
tion model is proposed to expand the activation scope of
baseline Re-ID model to explore rich visual cues, where
the backbone network is extended by a series of ordered
branches which share the same input but output comple-
mentary CAM. A novel Overlapped Activation Penalty is
proposed to force the current branch to pay more atten-
tion to the image regions less activated by the previous
ones, such that spatial diverse visual features can be dis-
covered. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art re-
sults on three Re-ID datasets. Moreover, a visualization ap-
proach termed ranking activation map (RAM) is proposed
to explicitly interpret the ranking results in the test stage,
which gives qualitative validations of the proposed method.

1. Introduction

Figure 1: (a) and (b) show the proposed RAMs. The maps
highlight the discriminative visual cues used by the base-
line and the proposed model to rank the gallery images, re-
spectively. Images with green and red boundary denote true
positive and false positive. In (c), the 1st row shows images
of the same ID and the CAM in the 2nd row highlights the
image regions, i.e., handbag, used by the baseline model to
identify this person. The CAM in 3rd-4th rows show the
proposed method further discover more visual cues.

Person Re-Identiﬁcation (Re-ID) aims to identify a par-
ticular person across multiple non-overlapping cameras. It
has important application prospects, e.g., large-scale person
tracking and person search in video surveillance. Although
signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in the last decade, it
is still confronted with many challenges, e.g., various back-
ground clutters, large variations of illuminations and camera
views and articulated deformations of the human pose.

Moreover, the small inter-person variation makes it dif-
ﬁcult for the Re-ID models to distinguish persons with sim-
ilar appearance based on a small number of visual cues. As
illustrated in Fig. 1(a), all the top 5 images are not the same
identity with the queried one, as the baseline model mainly

pays attention to the black shorts, but neglects the other
key discriminative visual cues, e.g., white shoes and bag
strap. To further illustrate the point, a diagnostic analysis
is conducted on the baseline model. The analysis is based
on a recently proposed visualization analytical tool, i.e.,
CAM [55]. The 2nd row in Fig. 1(c) presents the CAM of
the person in Market1501 [49], which shows that the base-
line model tends to identify this person based on a small
number but discriminative cues, i.e., handbag. The small
number of cues may be sufﬁcient for distinguishing person
IDs in the training set, however, it is essential for a Re-ID
model to discover abundant discriminative visual cues so as
to form a full-scale characteristic of each identity.

(c)querytop 5 in ranking listaggregate(a)(b)BaselineOursTo discover abundant discriminative features from the
limited training data, 1) some methods adopt particularly
designed regularizations or constraints and proposed var-
ious metric learning losses beyond the classiﬁcation loss,
such as triplet loss [13], quadruplet loss [5], and group
similarities learning [4]; 2) some methods devote to dis-
cover more ﬁne-grained visual cues spread over the whole
human body, where multi-branch networks are often pro-
posed to learn ﬁne-grained features from multiple body
parts. These parts are obtained through either rigid spatial
divisions [42, 26, 46, 7], latent parts localization [23, 27],
pose estimation[39, 44, 33], human parsing [19], or atten-
tion map [48]; 3) some methods attempt to increase varia-
tions in the training data with data augmentation, e.g., ran-
dom cropping (mirroring) [22], synthesized samples [52] by
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [11] or adversari-
ally occluded samples [14].

The proposed approach belongs to the second class in
the above categorization which focuses on discovering dis-
persive ﬁne-grained visual feature over whole human body.
However, previous work needs an extra step for body parts
localization with rigid spatial division, pose estimation or
learning latent parts, which increases the complexities and
uncertainties of algorithms.
Inspired by the CAM in the
2nd row of Fig. 1(c), we propose to expand the activation
scope of the baseline model, so that sufﬁcient visual fea-
tures can be learned over whole human body. Here, the vi-
sual discriminative regions are located by Class Activation
Maps [55], thus the proposed model is named Class Activa-
tion Maps Augmentation (CAMA). In the CAMA, the back-
bone model is extended by a series of ordered branches,
where a new loss function named Overlapped Activation
Penalty (OAP) is introduced to force current branch to dis-
cover diverse visual cues from those regions less activated
by the previous branches, so as to acquire diverse discrim-
inative ﬁne-grained features. To better interpret the rank-
ing results, a visualization method i.e., Ranking Activation
Maps, is proposed to explicitly visualize the associated vi-
sual features between the query and the gallery images in
the ranking list. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst
attempt to interpret the ranking results of person Re-ID.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized
as threefold. (1) An end-to-end multi-branch model is pro-
posed to discover sufﬁcient and diverse discriminative ﬁne-
grained features ﬂexibly, without the need of rigid spatial
division or extra part localization modules. (2) A novel loss
function, i.e., OAP, is proposed to force different branches
in the CAMA to learn complementary visual feature from
different body regions effectively. (3) Extensive experimen-
tal results show that a superior performance can be achieved
over other state-of-the-art methods on three large datasets,
where a new visualization method, i.e., RAM, is proposed
to interpret the ranking results of Re-ID for the ﬁrst time.

2. Related Work

Person Re-ID. Most person Re-ID methods focus on learn-
ing an effective feature extractor [42, 40], or metric that
pulls the same identities closer while pushes different ones
away [9, 13, 5, 25, 36, 4]. Being ﬁrst introduced in [46, 25],
the deep learning based methods have been dominating the
person Re-ID community.

The metric learning based methods adopt some regular-
izations or constraints to guide the Re-ID model to obtain a
set of diverse features, such as triplet loss[13], group simi-
larities learning [4] or quadruplet loss [5], where the essen-
tial factor lies in the quality of hard sample mining.

To learn an effective feature extractor to capture abun-
dant discriminative features,
some methods aggregate
global and local representation and show promising perfor-
mances. They leverage explicit pose estimation [2], human
parsing [10], or Spatial Transform Networks (STN) [16] to
locate body parts [39, 44, 33, 19, 27, 23], or directly use
the predeﬁned rigid parts (horizontal stripes or grids) for
ﬁne-grained feature extraction [42, 26, 46, 7, 1]. Compared
to the above methods, the proposed approach does not de-
pend on any external parts localization models. However,
the global representation extracted from the top layer of the
person Re-ID classiﬁcation network does not adequately re-
tain visual clues that are crucial for person Re-ID, e.g., ﬁne-
grained attributes (sunglasses, shoes) and some texture/edge
features at lower semantic level [23, 3, 14]. Therefore, some
researchers [3, 43] propose to fuse discriminative visual fea-
tures at multiple semantic levels.

Some other methods, e.g., Huang et al. [14] augment the
variation of training data by generating occluded samples;
Song et al. [38] introduce segmentation masks as guidance
to extract features invariant to background clutters; Shen
et al. [34] aims to improve the post-processing (i.e., re-
ranking [53]) to make it possible to learn in an end-to-end
manner. Moreover, instead of measuring similarity with Eu-
clidean distance, a Kronecker Product Matching module is
employed to match feature maps of different persons [36].
Similar idea can alse be found in [37].
Network Visualization. Convolutional neural networks
(CNN) are usually treated as a black-box function that maps
a given input to a task-speciﬁc output. There has been much
work devoted to explore how the CNN works, e.g., Decon-
vNet [47] visualizes what patterns activate a speciﬁc neu-
rons, Network Inversion [30] sheds light on the information
represented at each layer by inverting them to synthesize an
input image, and Class Activation Map (CAM) is proposed
to visualize the input image regions used when CNN mak-
ing decisions [55]. In this work, we enhance the capability
of Re-ID model for capturing diverse ﬁne-grained knowl-
edge through inspecting the intrinsic working mechanisms
of a trained network, which is closely related with current
researches on network interpretability and visualization.

3. Methods

This section presents the technical details on the CAMA
model. As shown in Fig. 2, the CAMA model is a multi-
branch (MltB) neural network including a backbone and
a number of ordered branches. Without the need of extra
parts localizations and exhaustive searching of informative
regions, we propose to utilize a technique on visual expla-
nation of deep learning, i.e., the CAM [55], to indicate the
locations of informative parts and the richness of features
embedded in the Re-ID model (Sec. 3.1). The new extended
branches are guided by the a novel loss function called OAP
to discover discriminative features from those regions less
activated by the previous branches (Sec. 3.2). Finally, a vi-
sualization technique termed RAM is proposed to interpret
the ranking results of a query image(Sec. 3.4).

3.1. Baseline Model

The forward propagation of the ID-discriminative em-
bedding (IDE) model speciﬁed in [50] is as follows. Firstly,
the input image passes through the CNN to obtain a tensor

T ∈ Rh×w×d, which can be interpreted as dense h × w
grids of d-dimensional local features T (x, y) ∈ R1×d of
spatial location (x, y), or dense d channels of feature map
Tk ∈ Rh×w, then global average pooling (GAP) is applied

on T to obtain a feature vector, ﬁnally a fully-connected
(FC) layer is used to transfer the feature vector into the class

scores S ∈ R1×C . Here C is the number of training classes.

The above procedure can be formulated as

S = FC(GAP(T ))

(1)

The work [45] proposes to add a batch normalization (BN)
layer [15] after the global average pooling layer, which can
be formulated as

S = FC(BN(GAP(T )))

(2)

where BN is the vanilla batch normalization [15] for a 1D
input. The Eq. (2) is denoted as IDE+BN in this paper.
Since IDE+BN achieves better performance over the IDE,
we adopt IDE+BN as the baseline. It is noted that the BN
and the GAP are linear transformations, thus the order of
these two transformations can be exchanged without chang-
ing the ﬁnal results. Thus Eq. (2) is further formulated as

S = FC(BN(Px,y T (x, y)
h × w
= FC(Px,y BN(T (x, y))
h × w
= FC(Px,y F (x, y)

h × w

))

)

) = FC(GAP(F ))

(3)

where F (x, y) = BN(T (x, y)) and F ∈ Rh×w×d is a ten-

sor. Note that without this re-formulation, the following
mentioned CAM can not be conveniently integrated with
the BN augmented baseline, i.e., Eq. (2).
Class Activation Maps [55].
In Eq. (3), after applying
GAP on F , a feature f is obtained. Then a FC layer

W ∈ Rd×C is used to transfer f into the class scores
S ∈ RC . Since Wc ∈ Rd×1 is a weight vector that gen-
erates a score Sc for class c (c ∈ {1, 2, ..., C}). We can

is deﬁned as Mc, where Mc(x, y) = Pd
k=1 Wc,kFk(x, y).
Mc(x, y) indicates the score that local feature F (x, y) ∈
R1×1×d contributes to Sc.
Suppose that t is the target class of the input image, Mt
is the class activation map of target class which indicates
the decision evidence of the CNN model as identifying the
input image. In this paper, we explore the usage of CAM
for person Re-ID in twofold. 1) We utilize CAM to locate
discriminative visual cues, based on which a learning prin-
ciple aiming to augment the CAM is proposed to enhance
the Re-ID model. 2) Inspired by the CAM, we propose the
RAM for interpreting the ranking results in the test stage.

3.2. Overlapped Activation Penalty

For each training image I with label t, where t is the in-
dex of the target class. I passes through N branches respec-

tively to obtain CAM, i.e., M i ∈ Rh×w×C , for each branch
t ∈ Rh×w, corresponds to
i. The t-th channel of M i, i.e., M i
the activation map of class t, and we use it to further obtain
ai to specify the image regions that i-th branch focuses on.
Here, we traverse all spatial locations (x, y) of M i
t with the
Sigmoid function to obtain a mask ai ∈ Rh×w.

ai(x, y) =

1
1 + exp(−(M i
t (x, y) − σi))

(5)

where the threshold σi is the k-th largest element of M i
t .
The Sigmoid function maps the elements larger than σi in
M i

t approximately to 1 while others to 0.
Since we aim to guide different branches to activate dif-
ferent image regions, the non-zero regions of ai in differ-
ent branches should be non-overlapping. To achieve that,
the overlapped activation penalty is proposed to measure

the area of the overlapped regions of ai, i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N},

which is deﬁned as follows:

Loap =

1

N Xx,y (cid:0)a1 ⊙ a2 ⊙ ··· ⊙ aN(cid:1)

(6)

3.3. Objective function

After global average pooling over the class activation
maps M i, we obtain the class scores Si in branch i, which
is further normalized by softmax function into a probabil-

ity distribution yi ∈ RC . The identiﬁcation loss in branch
i is calculated as the Cross Entropy between the predicted
probability yi and the ground-truth.

(4)

Li
id = −log(yi
t),

i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}

(7)

where t is the index of the target class, and the Li
id, i ∈
{1, 2, . . . , N}, are summed to obtain the identiﬁcation loss
of the CAMA model, i.e., Lid =PN

The ﬁnal objective function for the CAMA model is the

weighted summation of Lid and Loap.

i=1 Li

id.

Ltotal = Lid + αLoap

(8)

where α is the trade-off weight and we use α = 1 in all
experiments below. Loap prefers that the activated regions
of different branches are non-overlapping, while Lid guides
the CAMA model to activate the discriminative image re-
gions rather than the background.

In the test stage,

the feature vectors in all branches

{f 1, f 2, ..., f N} generated by applying global average
pooling on the feature maps {F 1, F 2, ..., F N} are con-
catenated to obtain the ﬁnal image representation f , i.e.,
f = [ ˆf 1; ˆf 2; ...; ˆf N ], where ˆf i denotes the L2 normaliza-
tion of f i.

3.4. Ranking Activation Map

Since the original CAM can not be implemented on the
person IDs that are unseen during the training stage. To
better interpret the ranking results, we propose the RAM,
which can reveal the associated visual cues between the
query and the gallery images. Here, we describe the pro-
cedure for generating ranking activation map.

Suppose that Fq and Fg correspond to the feature maps
of a query and a gallery image respectively. The fea-
ture representation is obtained by fq = GAP(Fq), fg =
GAP(Fg), where GAP denotes global average pooling.
Then L2 normalization is performed on f to obtain ˆf , i.e.,
ˆf =
kf k . The Euclidean distance between L2

normalized fq and fg is deﬁned as

d(fq, fg) =qh ˆfq − ˆfg, ˆfq − ˆfgi

=qh ˆfq, ˆfqi + h ˆfg, ˆfgi − 2h ˆfq, ˆfgi
=q2 − 2h ˆfq, ˆfgi =s2 − 2 hfq, fgi

where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication and N is the
number of branches.

where h(cid:5), (cid:5)i indicates the inner product of two vectors. Since
the similarity is inversely proportional to the distance, we

can observe from Eq. (9) that the similarity between query
and gallery image should be proportional to hfq ,fgi

can be further formulated as

itive and false positive respectively.

where Rq
indicates the score that the

tween q and g. Speciﬁcally, Rq
q is obtained by replacing fg
with fq in Eq. (10). We call {Rq
q, Rq
g| g ∈ {1, 2, ...NG}} the
ranking activation maps correspond to the query image q,
where NG is the number of gallery images. By simply up-
sampling the RAMs to the size of the corresponding images,
we can visualize the importance of the image regions lead-
ing to the ranking result.

Based on the above approach, we show some examples
of the RAMs generated using baseline model in Fig. 4.
Here, we only show top 10 images in the ranking results. In
Fig. 4(a), the RAM of query image (1st column) indicates
that the most salient feature is related to the green pocket.
For another query, the most salient region corresponds to
the red backpack (Fig. 4 (b)). The RAMs of top 10 gallery
images highlight the regions of green pocket and parts with
red color for the two queries respectively, which are seman-
tically consistent with the corresponding query images.

4. Experiments

4.1. Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

Experiments are performed on DukeMTMC-reID [32],
Market-1501[49], CUHK03 [25]. We adopt the Cumula-
tive Matching Characteristic (CMC) [12] and mean Average
Precision (mAP) [49] for performance metrics. All the ex-
perimental evaluations follow the single-query setting [49].
Market1501 contains 1,501 identities captured by 5 high-
resolution and one low-resolution cameras with different
viewpoints, 12,936 images from 751 identities as used for

training, 3,368 query images and 19,732 gallery images
from another 750 identities for testing. DukeMTMC-reID
contains 1,404 identities, 16,522 images for training, 2,228
query images, and 17,661 gallery images. Training and
test sets both consist of 702 identities, and person bounding
boxes are manually cropped. CUHK03 consists of 13,164
images of 1,467 persons, and each identity only appears
in two disjoint camera views. We adopt the new train-
ing/testing protocol proposed in [53], in which 767 iden-
tities are used for training and 700 for testing. CUHK03
offers both labeled and detected bounding boxes, we per-
form experiments on both of them.

4.2. Implementation Details

Model. We adopt the ResNet-50 that pre-trained on Im-
ageNet [8] as the baseline model, which has a convolu-
tional layer (named conv1) and four residual blocks, i.e.,
conv2 ∼ 5. The common base model in Fig. 2 consists
of conv1 ∼ 4 and the conv5s in different branches do not
share parameters. The classiﬁer weights are randomly ini-
tialized. Note that we follow the setting in PCB [42] that re-
moves the last spatial down-sampling operation in ResNet-
50 to increase the spatial size of output feature maps.
Preprocessing. The input image size is ﬁxed to h × w =
256 × 128 for all experiments on three Re-ID datasets. For
data augmentation, standard random cropping and horizon-
tal ﬂipping are used during training.
Optimization. We use Pytorch [31] to implement the
CAMA model. The Adam [21] optimizer is used with batch
size of 32. We ﬁrstly ﬁne-tuning classiﬁer weights, i.e., W i
in Fig. 2, for 10 epochs with the learning rate gradually in-

4.3. Comparison with State of the art Methods.

We compare the 2-branch and 3-branch CAMA with
the state-of-the-art methods. The comparison methods can
be separated into handcrafted feature based methods (H),
deep learning methods with global feature (G) and deep
learning methods employing local feature with or without
global feature (L(+G)). The results show that the proposed
method achieves the best performance. Note that: 1) Com-
pared to methods with part-level feature, our method ex-
ceeds PCB+RPP [42], which demonstrates the advantage
of the proposed CAM-based multi-branches CNN approach
to learn diverse features and enhance the discriminative ca-
pability of Re-ID models. 2) Compared to methods with
global feature, our methods outperform the MLFN, which
uses a fusion architecture to fuse features of multiple se-
mantic levels. Furthermore, the idea of MLFN is compati-
ble with our idea of mining more discriminative features at
the high-level, which will be further studied in the future.

4.4. Discussion with attention based mechanisms.

Although recent video-based work [24] has proposed to
diversify attention maps, there are three main differences
between [24] and the proposed model. 1) The motivation
of [24] is to discover a set of discriminative body parts for
avoiding the features from being corrupted by occluded re-
gion. While we aim to discover rich or even redundant
discriminative features from limited training set so as to
enhance the discriminative capability of Re-ID model on
unseen test set. 2) On the learning process, [24] connects
multiple attention modules with one single branch CNN, so
the learned attention modules can be regarded as a set of
part detectors relying exactly on the same set of CNN fea-

tures. While we adopt a multi-branch network to extract
more features from training data, where the CAM is used
for diversifying the discriminative features not part detec-
tors. 3) In test stage, the attention modules learned by [24]
or other attention based methods, e.g., [17], DLPA [48] and
the RPP in [42], are also used to calculate the attention maps
of test images for weighting the CNN features. While the
learned CAM coefﬁcients cannot be used in test stage, as
the test person IDs are unseen in the training set. So only
the multi-branch CNN networks are adopted to extract fea-
tures without any additional weighting operations. Thus,
from the above three aspects, our method is signiﬁcantly
different from [24] and other attention based methods.

4.5. Effect of Overlapped Activation Penalty.

In this section, we investigate the effect of each com-
ponent of our method by conducting analytic experiments
on three person Re-ID datasets. The results are presented
in Table. 4. The difference between MltB+Lid and the
baseline model (IDE+BN) is that MltB+Lid extends a se-
ries of ordered branches. However, MltB+Lid achieves
only a small margin over the baseline model, which indi-
cates that the visual features captured by different branches
are almost the same. We can see from the results that
MltB+Lid + Loap achieves signiﬁcant improvement over
MltB+Lid, which validates the powerful capability of the
proposed overlapped activation penalty to force the new
branch to focus on non-overlapping image regions so as to
discover diverse and discriminative visual features.

4.6. Parameters Analysis

In this section, we carry out experiments to study the
effect of the threshold σi in Eq. (5) and the number of
branches N , where σi is the k-th largest value of corre-
sponding activation map M i
t .

Inﬂuence of k. The larger k means the larger the ac-
tivated regions reserved by each branch after the Sigmoid
function Eq. (5). Since the last spatial down-sampling op-
eration in ResNet-50 is removed, the CAMA model outputs
activation map with 128(16×8) spatial grids. As illustrated
in Fig. 5, the mAP and rank-1 accuracies ﬂuctuate in a small
range when k is less than 26, but sharply decrease when k is
greater than 26 ( 26
128 ≃ 20%). That is because when k be-
comes too large, the overlapped activation penalty will en-

set to 2. The (k, mAP) and (k, rank-1) results are reported.

force the current branch to activate non-discriminative im-
age regions, e.g., the background, as the most discriminative
image regions have been reserved by the previous branch.

The number of branches N . According to Fig. 6, the
CAMA model achieves the best mAP and rank-1 perfor-
mance when N reaches to 3 on Market1501. The proposed
approach does not always perform better with the increase
of N , which indicates that the number of discriminative
visual cues of person ID is ﬁnite. As N increasing to 3,
the CAMA model is able to discover new cues on the im-
ages. When N is too large, the activated region of the new
branch cannot satisfy the constraints of Lid (discriminative)
and Loap (non-overlapped with the image regions activated
by the old branches) simultaneously. In this case, the new
branch is harmful to the optimization of the overall network,
thus the performance will reach to a peak value at a certain
value of N, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

4.7. Why does CAMA Work?

We aim to make the multiple branches of the CAMA
model focusing on different regions of the input image dur-
ing the training stage. However, do these branches pro-

and quantitative analysis are conducted on the proposed ap-
proach with 3 branches.
Qualitative analysis.

In Fig. 8, the RAMs reveal the
associated visual cues between query and gallery images
for each branch. We can observe that for the same input
query image, the features learned by different branches are
indeed complementary. Speciﬁcally, the features learned
by 1st branch, i.e., f 1
q , are most related to the black shorts
which also activates the 1st ranking list, while the 2nd and
3rd branches focus on the head and the lower body respec-
tively. It indicates that the proposed CAMA model indeed
captures diverse discriminative visual cues, thus the con-
catenated version of features from different branches pro-
duces a better ranking result. The RAMs of i-th branch in
Fig. 8 are generated by replacing fq in Eq. (10) with f i
q.

Quantitative analysis. With the aim of capturing rich
visual cues for person Re-ID, the branches in the CAMA
model are forced to activate different discriminative image
regions. Table. 5 indicates that the mAP and rank-1 accu-
racy perform better as more number of branches are used for
testing. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst branch of the CAMA model
only achieves 79.0% mAP and 90.9% rank-1 accuracy, as
more branches are combined for testing, the mAP, and rank-
1 accuracy gradually rise to 84.5% and 94.7% respectively.
Furthermore, we choose a number of person IDs with
similar appearance from the test set of Market1501 to visu-
alize the feature distribution by t-SNE [29]. These persons
are wearing purple clothes with small inter-person variation
as shown in Fig. 7 (c). By comparing Fig. 7 (a) and (b), we

positive and false positive respectively.

can observe that for identities that are hard distinguished by
the baseline model, the proposed approach can better dis-
tinguish them, e.g. the 9-th, 15-th, and 16-th identities.

5. Conclusion

In this work, we propose a CAMA model to discover
discriminative and diverse visual features for person Re-ID
which can enhance traditional global representation. The
proposed overlapped activation penalty can be implemented
ﬂexibly in an end-to-end training framework. Moreover, we
introduce RAM to visualize the associated visual features
between query and gallery images in a ranking list. With the
help of CAM and RAM, we show that the CAMA model
indeed acquires more discriminative features, which gives
qualitative validations of the learned Re-ID model clearly
and gives some insights into the interpretability of person
Re-ID model. In this work, we show that it is a promis-
ing way to enhance the Re-ID model from a respect of in-
terpretable CNN. In the future, we will extend the idea on
more recognition tasks, e.g., zero-shot learning (ZSL).
