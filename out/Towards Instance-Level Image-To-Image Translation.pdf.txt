Abstract

Unpaired Image-to-image Translation is a new ris-
ing and challenging vision problem that aims to learn a
mapping between unaligned image pairs in diverse do-
mains. Recent advances in this ﬁeld like MUNIT [11]
and DRIT [17] mainly focus on disentangling content and
style/attribute from a given image ﬁrst, then directly adopt-
ing the global style to guide the model to synthesize new do-
main images. However, this kind of approaches severely in-
curs contradiction if the target domain images are content-
rich with multiple discrepant objects.
In this paper, we
present a simple yet effective instance-aware image-to-
image translation approach (INIT), which employs the ﬁne-
grained local (instance) and global styles to the target im-
age spatially. The proposed INIT exhibits three import
advantages: (1) the instance-level objective loss can help
learn a more accurate reconstruction and incorporate di-
verse attributes of objects; (2) the styles used for target do-
main of local/global areas are from corresponding spatial
regions in source domain, which intuitively is a more rea-
sonable mapping; (3) the joint training process can beneﬁt
both ﬁne and coarse granularity and incorporates instance
information to improve the quality of global translation. We
also collect a large-scale benchmark1 for the new instance-
level translation task. We observe that our synthetic images
can even beneﬁt real-world vision tasks like generic object
detection.

1. Introduction

In the recent years, Image-to-Image (I2I) translation has
received signiﬁcant attention in computer vision commu-
nity, since many vision and graphics problems can be for-
mulated as an I2I translation problem like super-resolution,
neural style transfer, colorization, etc. This technique has

also been adapted to the relevant ﬁelds such as medical
image processing [40] to further improve the medical vol-
umes segmentation performance. In general, Pix2pix [13]
is regarded as the ﬁrst uniﬁed framework for I2I transla-
tion which adopts conditional generative adversarial net-
works [26] for image generation, while it requires the paired
examples during training process. A more general and chal-
lenging setting is the unpaired I2I translation, where the
paired data is unavailable.

Several recent efforts [42, 21, 11, 17, 1] have been made
on this direction and achieved very promising results. For
instance, CycleGAN [42] proposed the cycle consistency
loss to enforce the learning process that if an image is trans-
lated to the target domain by learning a mapping and trans-
lated back with an inverse mapping, the output should be
the original image. Furthermore, CycleGAN assumes the
latent spaces are separate of the two mappings. In contrast,
UNIT [21] assumes two domain images can be mapped onto

a shared latent space. MUNIT [11] and DRIT [17] fur-
ther postulate that the latent spaces can be disentangled to a
shared content space and a domain-speciﬁc attribute space.
However, all of these methods thus far have focused on
migrating styles or attributes onto the entire images. As
shown in Fig. 1 (1), they work well on the uniﬁed-style
scenes or relatively content-simple scenarios due to the
consistent pattern across various spatial areas in an image,
while this is not true for the complex structure images with
multiple objects since the stylistic vision disparity between
objects and background in an image is always huge or even
totally different, as in Fig. 1 (2).

To address the aforementioned limitation, in this paper
we present a method that can translate objects and back-
ground/global areas separately with different style codes as
in Fig. 1 (3), and still training in an end-to-end manner. The
motivation of our method is illustrated in Fig. 2. Instead
of using the global style, we use instance-level style vec-
tors that can provide more accurate guidance for visually
related object generation in target domain. We argue that
styles should be diverse for different objects, background
or global image, meaning that the style codes should not
be identical for the entire image. More speciﬁcally, a car
from “sunny” to the “night” domain should have different
style codes comparing to the global image translation be-
tween these two domains. Our method achieves this goal
by involving the instance-level styles. Given a pair of un-
aligned images and object locations, we ﬁrst apply our en-
coders to obtain the intermediate global and instance level
content and style vectors separately. Then we utilize the
cross-domain mapping to obtain the target domain images
by swapping the style/attribute vectors. Our swapping strat-
egy is introduced with more details in Sec. 3. The main
advantage of our method is the exploration and usage of ob-
ject level styles, which affects and guides the generation of
target domain objects directly. Certainly, we can also apply
the global style for target objects to enforce the model to
learn more diverse results.

In summary, our contributions are three fold:

• We propel I2I translation problem step forward to
instance-level such that the constraints could be ex-
ploited on both instance and global-level attributes by
adopting the proposed compound loss.

• We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative ex-
periments to demonstrate that our approach can sur-
pass against the baseline I2I translation methods. Our
synthetic images can be even beneﬁcial to other vision
tasks such as generic object detection, and further im-
prove the performance.

• We introduce a large-scale, multimodal, highly varied
I2I translation dataset, containing ∼155k streetscape
images across four domains. Our dataset not only in-
cludes the domain category labels, but also provides
the detailed object bounding box annotations, which
will beneﬁt the instance-level I2I translation problem.

2. Related Work

Image-to-Image Translation. The goal of I2I translation
is to learn the mapping between two different domains.
Pix2pix [13] ﬁrst proposes to use conditional generative ad-
versarial networks [26] to model the mapping function from
input to output images. Inspired by Pix2pix, some works
further adapt it to a variety of relevant tasks, such as seman-
tic layouts → scenes [14], sketches → photographs [33],
etc. Despite popular usage, the major weaknesses of these
methods are that they require the paired training examples
and the outputs are single-modal. In order to produce multi-
modal and more diverse images, BicycleGAN [43] encour-
ages the bijective consistency between the latent and tar-
get spaces to avoid the mode collapse problem. A genera-
tor learns to map the given source image, combined with a
low-dimensional latent code, to the output during training.
While this method still needs the paired training data.

Recently, CycleGAN [42] is proposed to tackle the un-
paired I2I translation problem by using the cycle consis-
tency loss. UNIT [21] further makes a share-latent assump-
tion and adopts Coupled GAN in their method. To address
the multimodal problem, MUNIT [11], DRIT [17], Aug-
mented CycleGAN [1], etc. adopt a disentangled represen-
tation to further learn diverse I2I translation from unpaired
training data.
Instance-level Image-to-Image Translation. To the best
of our knowledge, there are so far very few efforts on the
instance-level I2I translation problem. Perhaps the most
similar to our work is the recently proposed InstaGAN [27],
which utilizes the object segmentation masks to translate
both an image and the corresponding set of instance at-
tributes while maintaining the permutation invariance prop-
erty of instances. A context preserving loss is designed to
encourage model to learn the identity function outside of
target instances. The main difference with ours is that in-

staGAN cannot translate different domains for an entire im-
age sufﬁciently. They focus on translating instances and
maintain the outside areas, in contrast, our method can
translate instances and outside areas simultaneously and
make global images more realistic. Furthermore, InstaGAN
is built on the CycleGAN [42], which is single modal, while
we choose to leverage the MUNIT [11] and DRIT [17] to
build our INIT, thus our method inherits multimodal and
unsupervised properties, meanwhile, produces more diverse
and higher quality images.

Some other existing works [23, 18] are more or less re-
lated to this paper. For instance, DA-GAN [23] learns a
deep attention encoder to enable the instance-level trans-
lation, which is unable to handle the multi-instance and
complex circumstance. BeautyGAN [18] focuses on fa-
cial makeup transfer by employing histogram loss with face
parsing mask.

A New Benchmark for Unpaired Image-to-Image Trans-
lation. We introduce a new large-scale street scene cen-
tric dataset that addresses three core research problems in
I2I translation: (1) unsupervised learning paradigm, mean-
ing that there is no speciﬁc one-to-one mapping in the
dataset; (2) multimodal domains incorporation. Most ex-
isting I2I translation datasets provide only two different do-
mains, which limit the potential to explore more challeng-
ing task like multi-domain incorporation circumstance. Our
dataset contains four domains: sunny, night, cloudy and
rainy2 in a uniﬁed street scene; and (3) multi-granularity
(global and instance-level) information. Our dataset pro-
vides instance-level bounding box annotations, which can
utilize more details for learning a translation model. Tab. 1
shows a feature-by-feature comparison among various I2I
translation datasets. We also visualize some examples of
the dataset in Fig. 6. For instance category, we annotate
three common objects in street scenes including: car, per-
son, trafﬁc sign (speed limited sign). The detailed statistics
(# images) of the entire dataset are shown in Sec. 4.

3. Instance-aware Image-to-Image Translation

Our goal is to realize the instance-aware I2I translation
between two different domains without paired training ex-
amples. We build our framework by leveraging the MU-
NIT [11] and DRIT [17] methods. To avoid repetition, we
omit some innocuous details. Similar to MUNIT [11] and
DRIT [17], our method is straight-forward and simple to
implement. As illustrated in Fig. 5, our translation model
consists of two encoders Eg, Eo (g and o denote the global
and instance image regions respectively), and two decoders
Gg, Go in each domain X or Y. A more detailed illustra-
tion is shown in Fig. 4. Since we have the object coordi-
nates, we can crop the object areas and feed them into the
instance-level encoder to extra the content/style vectors. An
alternative method for object content vectors is to adopt RoI
pooling [5] from the global image content features. Here we
use image crop (object region) and share the parameters for
the two encoders, which is more easier to implement.
Disentangle content and style on object and entire im-
age. As [3, 25, 11, 17], our method also decomposes input
images/objects into a shared content space and a domain-
speciﬁc style space. Take global image as an example, each
encode Eg can decompose the input to a content code cg
and a style code sg, where Eg = (Ec
g(I),
sg = Es
g(I), I denotes the input image representation. cg
and sg are global-level content/style features.
Generate style code bank. We generate the style codes
from objects, background and entire images, which form

we further extend it to realize the instance-level translation purpose. Note that after content-style association, the generated images will
place in the target domain, so a translation back process will be employed before self-reconstruction, which is not illustrated here.

our style code bank for the following swapping operation
and translation. In contrast, MUNIT [11] and DRIT [17] use
only the entire image style or attribute, which is struggling
to model and cover the rich image spatial representation.
Associate content-style pairs for cyclic reconstruction.
Our cross-cycle consistency is performed by swapping
encoder-decoder pairs (dashed arc lines in Fig. 5). The
cross-cycle includes two modes: cross-domain (X ↔ Y)
and cross-granularity (entire image ↔ object). We illus-
trate cross-granularity (image ↔ object) in Fig. 5, the cross-
domain consistency (X ↔ Y) is similar to MUNIT [11] and
DRIT [17]. As shown in Fig. 3, the swapping or content-
style association strategy is a hierarchical structure across
multi-granularity areas. Intuitively, the coarse (global) style
can affect ﬁne content and be adopted to local areas, while

it’s not true if the process is reversed. Following [11], we
also use AdaIN [10] to combine the content and style vec-
tors.
Incorporate Multi-Scale. It’s technically easy to incorpo-
rate multi-scale advantage into the framework. We simply
replace the object branch in Fig. 5 with resolution-reduced
images. In our experiments, we use 1/2 scale and original
size images as pairs to perform scale-augmented training.
Speciﬁcally, styles from small size and original size images
can be performed to each other, and the generator needs
to learn multi-scale reconstruction for both of them, which
leads to more accurate results.
Reconstruction loss. We use self-reconstruction and cross-
cycle consistency loss [17] for both entire image and object
that encourage reconstruction of them. With encoded c and
s, the decoders should decode them back to original input,

ˆI = Gg(Ec

g(I), Es

g(I)), ˆo = Go(Ec

o(o), Es

o(o))

(1)

We can also reconstruct the latent distribution (i.e. content
and style vectors) as [11].

ˆco = Ec

o(Go(co, sg)), ˆso = Es

o(Go(co, sg))

(2)

where co and sg are instance-level content and global-level
style features. Then, we can use the following formation to
learn a reconstruction of them:

recon = E

k∼p(k) h(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

ˆk − k(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)1i

where k can be I, o, c or s. p(k) denotes the distribution of
data k. The formation of cross-cycle consistency is similar
to this process and more details can be referred to [17].
Adversarial loss. Generative adversarial learning [6] has
been adapted to many visual tasks, e.g., detection [28, 2],
inpainting [30, 38, 12, 37], ensemble [34], etc. We adopt
adversarial loss Ladv where Dg
Y attempt
to discriminate between real and synthetic images/objects
in each domain. We explore two designs for the discrimina-
tors: weight-sharing or weight-independent for global and
instance images in each domain. The ablation experimen-
tal results are shown in Tab. 3 and Tab. 4, we observe that
shared discriminator is a better choice in our experiments.

During inference time, we simply use the global branch
to generate the target domain images (See Fig. 4 upper-right
part) so that it’s not necessary to use bounding box annota-
tions at this stage, and this strategy can also guarantee that
the generated images are harmonious.

4. Experiments and Analysis

We conduct experiments on our collected dataset (INIT).
We also use COCO dataset [20] to verify the effectiveness
of data augmentation.
INIT Dataset. INIT dataset consists of 132,201 images for
training and 23,328 images for testing. The detailed statis-
tics are shown in Tab. 2. All the data are collected in Tokyo,
Japan with SEKONIX AR0231 camera. The whole collec-
tion process lasted about three months.
Implementation Details. Our implementation is based on
MUNIT3 with PyTorch [29]. For I2I translation, we resize
the short side of images to 360 pixels due to the limitation of
GPU memory. For COCO image synthesis, since the train-
ing images (INIT dataset) and target images (COCO) are
in different distributions, we keep the original size of our
training image and crop 360×360 pixels to train our model,
in order to learn more details of images and objects, mean-
while, ignore the global information. In this circumstance,
we build our object part as an independent branch and each

4.1. Baselines

We perform our evaluation on the following four recent
proposed state-of-the-art unpaired I2I translation methods:

- CycleGAN [42]: CycleGAN contains two translation
functions (X → Y and X ← Y), and the correspond-
ing adversarial loss. It assumes that the input images can
be translated to another domain and then can be mapped
back with a cycle consistency loss.

- UNIT [21]: The UNIT method is an extension of Cycle-
GAN [42] that is based on the shared latent space assump-
tion.
It contains two VAE-GANs and also uses cycle-
consistency loss [42] for learning models.

- MUNIT [11]: MUNIT consists of an encoder and a de-
coder for each domain.
It assumes that the image rep-
resentation can be decomposed into a domain-invariant
content space and a domain-speciﬁc style space. The la-
tent vectors of each encoder are disentangled to a content
vector and a style vector. I2I translation is performed by
swapping content-style pairs.

- DRIT [17]: The motivation of DRIT is similar to MUNIT.
It consists of content encoders, attribute encoders, gener-
ators and domain discriminators for both domains. The
content encoder maps images into a shared content space
and the attribute encoder maps images into a domain-
speciﬁc attribute space. A cross-cycle consistency loss
is adopted for performing I2I translation.

4.2. Evaluation

We adopt the same evaluation protocol from previous un-
supervised I2I translation works and evaluate our method
with the LPIPS Metric [39], Inception Score (IS) [32] and
Conditional Inception Score (CIS) [11].

LPIPS Metric. Zhang et al. proposed LPIPS distance [39]
to measure the translation diversity, which has been veri-
ﬁed to correlate well with human perceptual psychophysical
similarity. Following [11], we calculate the average LPIPS
distance between 19 pairs of randomly sampled translation
outputs from 100 input images of our test set. Follow-
ing [11] and recommended by [39], we also use the pre-
trained AlexNet [15] to extract deep features.

Results are summarized in Tab. 3, “INIT w/ Ds” denotes

image and object. “INIT w/o Ds” denotes we build separate
discriminators for image and object. Thanks to the coarse
and ﬁne styles we used, our average INIT w/ Ds score out-
performs MUNIT with a notable margin. We also observe
that our dataset (real image) has a very large diversity score,
which indicates that the dataset is diverse and challenging.
Inception Score (IS) and Conditional Inception Score
(CIS). We use the Inception Score (IS) [32] and Condi-
tional Inception Score (CIS) [11] to evaluate our learned
models. IS measures the diversity of all output images and
CIS measures diversity of output conditioned on a single
input image, which is a modiﬁed IS that is more suitable
for evaluating multimodal I2I translation task. The detailed
deﬁnition of CIS can be referred to [11]. We also employ
with Inception V3 model [36] to ﬁne-tune our classiﬁcation
model on four domain category labels of our dataset. Other

settings are the same as [11]. It can be seen in Tab. 4 that
our results are consistently better than the baselines MUNIT
and DRIT.
Image Synthesis on Multiple Datasets The visualization
of our synthetic images is shown in Fig. 7. The left group
images are on COCO and the right are on Cityscapes. We
observe that the most challenging problem for multiple
datasets synthesis is the inter-class variance among them.
Data Augmentation for Detection & Segmentation on
COCO. We use Mask RCNN [8] framework for the exper-
iments. A synthetic copy of entire COCO dataset is gener-
ated by our sunny→night model. We employ open-source
implementation of Mask RCNN4 for training the COCO
models. For training, we use the same number of training
epochs and other default settings including the learning rat-
ing schedule, # batchsize, etc.

All results are summarized in Tab. 5, the ﬁrst column
(group) shows the training data we used, the second group
shows the validation data where we tested on. The third
and fourth groups are detection and segmentation results,
respectively. We can observe that our real-image trained
model can obtain 30.4% mAP on synthetic validation im-
ages, this indicates that the distribution differences between
original COCO and our synthetic images are not very huge.
It seems that our generation process is more likely to do

photo-metric distortions or brightness adjustment of im-
ages, which can be regarded as a data augmentation tech-
nique and has been veriﬁed the effectiveness for object de-
tection in [22]. From the last two rows we can see that not
only the synthetic images can help improve the real image
testing performance, but the real image can also boost the
results of synthetic images (both train and test on synthetic
images). We also compare improvement with different gen-
eration methods in Tab. 6. The results show that our ob-
ject branch can bring more beneﬁts for detection task than
the baseline. We also believe that the proposed data aug-
mentation method can beneﬁt to some limited training data
scenarios like learning detectors from scratch [35, 7].

We further conduct scene parsing on Cityscapes [4].
However, we didn’t see obvious improvement in this ex-
periment. Using PSPNet [41] with ResNet-50 [9], we ob-
tain mIoU: 76.6%, mAcc: 83.1% when training and testing
on real images and 74.6%/81.1% on both synthetic images.
We can see that the gaps between real and synthetic image
are really small. We conjecture this case (no gain) is be-
cause the synthetic Cityscapes is too close to the original
one. We compare the performance decline in Tab. 7. Since
the metrics are different in COCO and Cityscapes, we use
the relative percentage for comparison. The results indicate
that the synthetic images may be more diverse for COCO
since the decline is much smaller on Cityscapes.

that the various degrees of darkness are generated across
these images.
Instance Generation. The results of generated instances
are shown in Fig. 9, our method can generate more diverse
objects (columns 1, 2, 6), more details (columns 5, 6, 7)
with even the reﬂection (column 7). MUNIT sometimes
fails to generate desired results if the global style is not suit-
able for the target object (column 2).

Visualization of style distri-
bution by t-SNE [24]. The
groups with the same color
are paired object and global
styles of same domain.

Comparison of Local (Object) and Global Style Code
Distributions. To further verify our assumption that the
object and global styles are distinguishable enough to disen-
tangle, we visualize the embedded style vectors from our w/
Ds model. The visualization is plotted by t-SNE tool [24].
We randomly sample 100 images and objects in the test set
of each domain, results are shown in Fig. 5. The same color
groups represent the paired global images and objects in the
same domain. We can observe that the style vectors of same
domain global and object images are grouped and separate
with a remarkable margin, meanwhile, they are neighboring
in the embedded space. This is reasonable and demonstrates
the effectiveness of our learning process.

5. Analysis

6. Conclusion

Qualitative Comparison. We qualitatively compare our
method with baseline MUNIT [11]. Fig. 10 shows example
results on sunny→night. We randomly select one output for
each method. It’s obvious that our results are much more
realistic, diverse with higher quality. If the object area is
small, MUNIT [11] may fall into mode collapse and brings
small artifacts around object area, in contrast, our method
can overcome this problem through instance-level recon-
struction. We also visualize the multimodal results in Fig. 8
with randomly sampled style vectors. It can be observed

In this paper, we have presented a framework for
instance-aware I2I translation with unpaired training data.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the proposed method can capture the details of objects
and produce realistic and diverse images. Meanwhile, we
also built up a large scale dataset with bounding box anno-
tation for the instance-level I2I translation problem.
