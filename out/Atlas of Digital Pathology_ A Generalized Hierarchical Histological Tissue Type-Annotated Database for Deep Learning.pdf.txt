Abstract

In recent years, computer vision techniques have made
large advances in image recognition and been applied
to aid radiological diagnosis. Computational pathology
aims to develop similar tools for aiding pathologists in di-
agnosing digitized histopathological slides, which would
improve diagnostic accuracy and productivity amidst in-
creasing workloads. However, there is a lack of publicly-
available databases of (1) localized patch-level images an-
notated with (2) a large range of Histological Tissue Type
(HTT). As a result, computational pathology research is
constrained to diagnosing speciﬁc diseases or classifying
tissues from speciﬁc organs, and cannot be readily general-
ized to handle unexpected diseases and organs.

In this paper, we propose a new digital pathology
database, the “Atlas of Digital Pathology” (or ADP), which
comprises of 17,668 patch images extracted from 100 slides
annotated with up to 57 hierarchical HTTs. Our data is
generalized to different tissue types across different organs
and aims to provide training data for supervised multi-label
learning of patch-level HTT in a digitized whole slide im-
age. We demonstrate the quality of our image labels through
pathologist consultation and by training three state-of-the-
art neural networks on tissue type classiﬁcation. Quantita-
tive results support the visually consistency of our data and
we demonstrate a tissue type-based visual attention aid as
a sample tool that could be developed from our database.

1 Introduction

The ﬁeld of computational pathology aims to develop
computer algorithms to assist the diagnosis of disease from
digital pathology images by pathologists [21]. Leveraging
the impressive advances of computer vision in solving dif-
ﬁcult general image recognition problems (e.g. recognizing

dogs and cats) [9, 32, 16, 33, 12, 38], computational pathol-
ogy promises to improve the diagnostic accuracy and pro-
ductivity of pathologists, who face an increasingly heavy
workload [27, 41, 21, 15]. In fact, the use of computer vi-
sion algorithms in computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) has
already become widely accepted in the sister ﬁeld of radi-
ology [29, 40, 5]. But as there exist serious shortcomings
in publicly-available digital pathology databases, and most
state-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained by su-
pervised learning, this constrains the development of useful
and generalizable computational pathology tools.

Most databases are either annotated with textual descrip-
tions or annotated at the slide level with minimal local-
ized information provided by drawn outlines [21]. This
is problematic because, unlike general image classiﬁcation,
digital pathology slide images are very large compared to
the features of interest, where local patch-level (or even
pixel-level) information is essential. Furthermore, existing
databases are specially annotated with an incomplete set of
possible tissue conditions (i.e. healthy, disease #1, disease
#2, ..., disease #N) and hence cannot be generalized to clas-
sify unexpected diseases or unseen organs. Since only a
limited number of possible tissue types are observable, it
makes more sense to annotate tissue types. Some databases
do just that, but use only a few tissue types, which again
limits their application. This lack of (1) localized patch-
level images annotated with (2) a large range of Histological
Tissue Type (HTT) prevents computational pathology from
properly developing generalized clinically useful tools.

Inspired by this shortcoming in publicly available digi-
tal pathology databases, we introduce the Atlas of Digital
Pathology (ADP or Atlas, for short), a database of digi-
tal pathology image patches originating from a variety of
organs acquired by a whole slide imaging (WSI) scanner,
and each annotated with multiple HTTs (both morpholog-

432111747

ical and functional) organized in a hierarchical taxonomy.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no other similar
databases of digital pathology originating from different or-
gans and annotated at the patch level with multiple, hierar-
chical HTTs, and this makes our database singularly well-
suited for training useful computational pathology tools.

Our database annotations are validated by an experi-
enced pathologist which uniquely exploits a priori knowl-
edge of the hierarchical relations between HTTs. As it is
labeled with tissue type at the patch level, it can be used
to develop a computational pathology system for assisting
pathologists in their diagnostic evaluations of whole slide
images with patch-level resolution. Furthermore, we adopt
three existing CNN architectures - VGG16 [33], ResNet18
[12], and Inception-V3 [38] - and validate the quality of
our labeling by training them for tissue type classiﬁcation
using multi-label hierarchical classiﬁcation loss. The ex-
cellent predictive performance of these networks not only
further validates the labeling quality, but also suggests the
possibility of applying the data to develop computational
pathology tools for solving more difﬁcult related problems.
An obvious immediate application of the Atlas of Dig-
ital Pathology would be the development of a multi-label
supervised learning algorithm for predicting patch-level tis-
sue type, which could be used to localize tissue types in a
whole slide image as an automated attention aid for pathol-
ogists. For instance, such a tool could highlight glandu-
lar tissue regions for cancer diagnosis or show regions of
tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes for disease prognosis, thus
helping pathologists streamline their visual search proce-
dure. Our Atlas data could be feasibly extended to develop:
(a) pixel-level interpretation of WSI via weakly-supervised
semantic segmentation to obtain instance-level outlines of
individual tissue structures which can assist pathologists in
visually searching for relevant tissues, which is known to be
time consuming and inconsistent [17, 28]; (b) tissue mor-
phometric analysis to automatically measure the shapes of
tissue structure, that is needed for diagnosing certain dis-
eases [11]; (c) abnormality detection that would associate
disease prognosis with the shape and arrangement of tissue
structures [4]; and (d) image retrieval based on HTT en-
coding which would enable more semantically-relevant ap-
proaches than existing unsupervised Content-Based Image
Retrieval (CBIR) approaches [37, 24, 23, 44, 14, 25, 45, 46].

1.1 Related Work

As mentioned above, there exist many publicly avail-
able databases of labeled digital pathology images, which
may be broadly classiﬁed into three types:
(1) govern-
ment or academic repositories, (2) educational sites, and (3)
grand challenges. The ﬁrst type is released by governmen-
tal agencies or academic medical research departments for
enabling research into the relationships between diagnos-
tic outcomes and histological image features, including The

Human Protein Atlas [31], The Cancer Genome Atlas [42],
and the Stanford Tissue Microarray Database [26]. These
databases are very large and cataloged with structured slide-
level mixed-format annotations (e.g. patient data, survival
outcomes, pathologist diagnosis). Chang et al. train three-
class tissue classiﬁers with TCGA in [6] and Sirinukunwat-
tana et al. train four-class nuclei classiﬁers with STMD in
[35]. The second type is released by medical teaching de-
partments for educating their students in histology, contain
fewer examples, and are annotated with unstructured slide-
level textual descriptions (e.g.
labels pointing at diseased
regions) - these are very difﬁcult to apply to computational
pathology. The third type is released by academic research
departments and teaching hospitals for evaluating compu-
tational algorithms applied to a chosen clinically-relevant
problem, known as Grand Challenges, and include the MIC-
CAI Nuclei Segmentation [18], MICCAI Gland Segmenta-
tion [34], and CAMELYON [20] contests. These databases
tend to be moderately large in size, focused on particular
tissues or conditions, and cataloged with patch-level cate-
gorical or positional annotations relevant to the problem at
hand (e.g. cancerous or non-cancerous, locations of mitotic
ﬁgures). These databases are commonly used for computa-
tional pathology: Chen et al. won MICCAI Gland Segmen-
tation 2015 with their DCAN [7], while Lee and Baeng won
CAMELYON17 with their multi-stage framework [19].

1.2 What is Missing?

As stated above, the existing databases are focused on
slides exhibiting particular organs (e.g. breast tissue) either
annotated at the slide level with particular diagnostic condi-
tions (e.g. cancer grades) or at the local patch level with
particular tissue structures (e.g. glands) to the exclusion
of other conditions and structures. Therefore, the current
compilation format of annotated database limits the proper
means of developing tissue recognition tasks for computa-
tion pathology in the ﬁrst place. In fact, a meaningful recog-
nition tool should be capable of identifying a wide range of
tissue spectrum, so one can narrow down to certain tissue(s)
for diagnostic analysis. Our proposed database, though, in-
cludes histological tissue slides from different organs and
annotated at the patch level with different tissue structures.

2 Construction of Atlas Database

This section explains the construction of Atlas database
from diverse HTTs originating from various organs. First,
we describe the WSI scanning workﬂow to digitize the glass
slides and divide them into patches. Then, we explain our
proposed hierarchical taxonomy of HTT and patch label-
ing procedure. Finally, we analyze statistical patterns of the
resultant multi-label categorical HTT data through Associ-
ation Rule Learning and visualize the label co-occurrences
as a graph network, and describe the validation of our tissue
type label data by an experienced pathologist.

2.1 Whole slide imaging (WSI) workﬂow

A total of 100 glass slides were selected from a larger
size of 500 anonymized glass slides (each sized 1”×3”
and 1.0 mm in thickness) by observing the slides under a
Nikon H550L brightﬁeld microscope using the 20x objec-
tive lens and 0.75 numerical aperture. We selected those
slides with (a) acceptably few focus variations caused by
tissue specimen thickness [13, 10], (b) diverse spectrum of
color variations of tissue stains [3, 8], (c) acceptably few
preparation imperfections such as air bubbles and tissue
folding/crushing/cracks, (d) different organs of origin, such
as brain, kidney, breast, liver, and heart, and (e) different
diagnoses (i.e. disease or non-disease related).

These 100 selected glass slides were then digitized using
a Huron TissueScope LE1.2 WSI scanner at 40X magniﬁ-
cation (0.25µm/pixel resolution, uncompressed TIFF ﬁle)
and each digital slide was then divided into a random-
ized subset of recognizable non-background patches of size
1088 × 1088 pixels with an overlap of 32 pixels - 17,668
patches were collected in total. Background patches - those
with more than 97.5% of pixels exceeding 85% intensity on
all three RGB channels - were excluded. Patches without
any recognizable tissue due to signiﬁcant focus problems
or non-tissue objects (e.g. dust specks) were also excluded.
On average, each glass slide produced 177 patches (mini-
mum: 12 patches, maximum: 280 patches); most appeared
to be stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).

2.2 Hierarchical Taxonomy of Histological Tis-

sues

Given digital pathology slide patches containing visibly-
recognizable tissues, we assume that each patch originates
from an unknown organ and can be classiﬁed with one or
more histological types. Here, we elaborate on the chosen
taxonomy of histological tissue types and their organizing
principles.
In histology itself, there are two practical ap-
proaches: (1) Basic Histology, which studies tissue struc-
ture (or morphology), and (2) Systematic (or Functional)
Histology, which studies tissue functionality and organiza-
tion into organs. The Basic Histology approach is readily
applicable to the slide patches because even a small visual
ﬁeld is sufﬁcient to identify the tissue structure. By con-
trast, the Systematic Histology approach is generally not
applicable for labeling the slide patches since the organ of
origin is usually unknown and a larger visual ﬁeld is needed
to provide the spatial context for understanding the tissue
functionality. Note that this excludes the cases of smaller
functional structures such as glands and transport vessels.
Hence, we consulted standard histology texts [43, 30] and
selectively combined both approaches to tissue type classi-
ﬁcation to suit patch-level analysis in our proposed three-
level tissue type taxonomy. The top level contains seven
basic histological (or morphological) tissue types (a super-
set of the ﬁve basic types in [43] and four basic types in

[30]) and two systematic histological (or functional) tissue
types (“Glandular” and “Transport Vessel”). We organized
the taxonomy to further divide each top-level tissue type
into more speciﬁc sub-types, each of which corresponds
to a visually identiﬁable tissue type and not, for example,
to an abstract grouping or organ of origin such as epithe-
lium/endothelium/mesothelium. For cases where a more
speciﬁc child node type cannot be identiﬁed, we associated
a “Undifferentiated” child node type to the parent but did
not consider such nodes as belonging to that level (due to
its insufﬁcient speciﬁcity). Table 1 details the full hierar-
chical tissue type taxonomy, the associated letter codes of
each type, and provides the number of occurrences of each
tissue type label.

Table 1. Hierarchical taxonomy of histological tissue type used for
supervised labeling of the proposed Atlas database. The tissue hi-
erarchy consists of three layers, starting from the least speciﬁc top
level to the most speciﬁc bottom level. The bracketed numbers in
the ﬁrst row correspond to the number of non-“Undifferentiated”
types falling in the corresponding level.

2.3 Tissue Type Labeling Workﬂow

A total of ﬁve labelers were assigned to perform the tis-
sue type labeling of the slide patches. All labelers were ﬁrst
trained to recognize the tissue types (as proposed above) us-
ing annotated exemplar images sourced from standard his-
tology texts such as in [43, 30]. Furthermore, the following
labeling criteria were agreed upon in order to ensure label-
ing consistency: (a) non-cellular labels (those with singular
form names, e.g. “Loose Connective”) are assigned when-
ever the tissue is conﬁdently discerned to be present in any
quantity anywhere in the patch; (b) cellular labels (those
with plural form names, e.g. “Erythrocytes”) are assigned
whenever ﬁve or more cells are conﬁdently discerned to be
present anywhere in the patch; (c) each pixel in a patch can
correspond to at most one morphological type, but might
also correspond to an additional functional type and vice
versa (e.g. “Simple Columnar Epithelial” and “Exocrine
Gland”); (d) labels are to be assigned at the most speciﬁc
level possible; and (e) if a patch has no recognizable tissue
structures, it is to be excluded from the database.

Figure 1. Sample patches, annotated with arrows pointing to the
regions displaying the respective tissue type labels - to interpret
the tissue type letter codes, please refer to Table 1

In Figure 1, four exemplar patches are indicated with
their ground-truth labels overlaid as black arrows point-
ing to the patch regions displaying the corresponding tis-
sue types (to be clear, each patch is assigned global labels
without local position information and the arrow labeling
indicated here is included for the purpose of demonstra-
tion only). Note that the tissue types tend to correspond
to speciﬁc visual patterns and relative spatial relationships,
which suggests that general visual pattern recognition algo-
rithms sensitive to spatial context (such as Convolutional
Neural Networks) can be readily applied for supervised
learning. “Epithelial” appears as linearly-arranged nuclei-
dense cells lining a surface, “Connective Proper” appears
as long ﬁbrous cells with scant nuclei between other tis-
sues, “Blood” appears as circular/ovoid blobs which some-
times clump together and are often inside transport ves-

sels1, “Skeletal” appears as a woody material which some-
times contains layered rings and sometimes appears mot-
tled with lighter regions, “Adipose” appears as clustered
rings or bubbles, “Muscular” appears as parallel (longitu-
dinal cut) or bundled (transverse cut) dense ﬁbrous cells
with oblong nuclei, “Nervous” appears as wispy strands
connecting branching circular blobs, “Glandular” appears
as epithelium-lined ovoid structures with or without inner
openings, and “Transport Vessel” corresponds to string-like
rings often containing blood.
2.4 Label Metadata

The tissue type labelers only assigned labels at the
leaf nodes of the hierarchical taxonomy described in Ta-
ble 1. However, we can also assign the non-leaf ances-
tor nodes tissue types based on their descendant nodes -
this is done by assigning an ancestor node label if at least
one descendant node label is present. For example, if
y = [· · · , yC.D, yC.D.I, · · · ] is the ground-truth tissue type
label vector for a given patch and yC.D.I = 1 (present),
then its parent label yC.D is also set to 1. After augment-
ing the leaf-node labels with these originally un-labeled
ancestor nodes, we associate each slide patch with a 57-
dimensional binary label vector y ∈ {0, 1}57 (i.e. all the
non-“Undifferentiated” types), which has at least one non-
zero element. Our proposed database includes the patch im-
age ﬁles and their associated augmented binary labels in a
comma-separated ﬁle. See Table 1 for the class exemplar
counts for the leaf-node types.
2.5 Tissue Type Label Statistics

In this section, we demonstrate some methods of under-
standing the statistics of HTT label data: (1) Co-occurrence
Network Analysis, and (2) Association Rule Learning.

Firstly, we model the data as a graph (with the tissue type
labels modeled as nodes and label co-occurrences modeled
as edges weighted by their counts) and visualize the co-
occurrence network. Figure 2 displays the co-occurrence
networks at the three levels of the hierarchical taxonomy,
visualized with the nodes in both circular (i.e. nodes posi-
tioned in a circle) and force-directed layouts (i.e. nodes are
cluttered to equalize edge length and minimize edge cross-
ings). For the force-directed layout plots 2(d), 2(e), and
2(f), the nodes are additionally colored by their k-means
clusters (k = 6) and the cluster regions are displayed in the
background. Note that the vast majority of the slide patches
belong to a large central interconnected cluster consisting
of epithelial, connective proper, blood, muscular, glandular,
and transport vessel types (although signiﬁcant sub-clusters
exist for deeper levels of the hierarchy), while the less com-
mon skeletal, adipose, and nervous types tend to occur sep-
arately.

three levels of the hierarchical taxonomy (from left to right) and
in two layouts - circular (top) and force-directed (bottom) with k-
means clustering. To interpret the tissue type letter codes, please
refer to the level-appropriate columns of Table 1

Secondly, we apply the Apriori Association Rule Learn-
ing algorithm [2] (with a support threshold of 0.01 and a
conﬁdence threshold of 0.5) and display the most signif-
icant rule for each unique consequent label where such a
rule exists. Following Agrawal et al.
in [1], we deﬁne a
rule to be between an antecedent itemset and a consequent
label. As may be seen from the results in Table 2, 12 out
of the 36 possible labels have associated rules with conﬁ-
dence exceeding the conﬁdence threshold. The most conﬁ-
dent rule is “{E.M.S, E.M.O, H.Y} ⇒ T”, which indicates
that 99.643% of patches labeled with “Simple Squamous
Epithelial”, “Simple Columnar Epithelial”, and “Lympho-
cytes” are also labeled with “Transport Vessel”, which sup-
ports the observation about the relative spatial relationships
between tissue types mentioned above.

ing algorithm to the multi-label data, displaying only the most sig-
niﬁcant rule for each unique consequent label where such a rule

2.6 Pathologist Validation

In order to further ensure accuracy of labeling, a ran-
dom set of 1000 tissue patches was reviewed by an expe-
rienced, board-certiﬁed pathologist. The pathologist was

provided with the LabelViewer Graphical User Interface
(GUI), where patches could be viewed one at a time in con-
junction with the labels that were assigned by the original
ﬁve labelers (see Section 2.3). The pathologist was pro-
vided with the same instructions and information regarding
the tissue type hierarchical taxonomy as the original label-
ers. After comparing each image patch with its assigned
labels, the pathologist was able to provide speciﬁc notes on
each patch with respect to labels that should be added, re-
moved, or modiﬁed.

There was excellent concordance between the original
labelers and the Pathologist at the higher levels (1-2) of the
tissue type hierarchical taxonomy, with most of the sug-
gested modiﬁcations relating to Level 3 of the Epithelial
branch (e.g. simple cuboidal epithelial vs. simple columnar
epithelial) and occasionally at Level 2 (stratiﬁed vs. sim-
ple). This discordance is most likely attributable to the
original labelers’ inexperience with interpreting tissues that
mimic other tissue types due to tangential sectioning, prepa-
ration artefacts, or suboptimal section thickness. Further
detailed analysis of the pathologist’s validation is provided
in the supplementary materials.
2.7 How to Access ADP Database?

The detail information on accessing ADP database can
be found in the website2. ADP is released as an early ver-
sion V1.0 and will be updated as an ongoing research effort
to provide useful computational pathology database for aca-
demic researchers and educators around the world.

3 Experiments

In this section, we explain our experiment to computa-
tionally evaluate the labeling quality of the slide patches
with three state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network
architectures: VGG16 [33], ResNet18 [12], and Inception-
V3 [38]; we trained the networks separately on ﬂat clas-
siﬁcation of the three levels of the tissue type hierarchi-
cal taxonomy. Furthermore, for the second and third lev-
els, where ﬂat classiﬁcation assumes label independence,
we tested exploiting prior knowledge about the hierarchical
relations between tissue types with the hierarchical binary
relevance method. In the rest of this section, we explain the
hierarchical binary relevance method, the training setup, the
experimental results in both patch level and slide level, and
the failure modes of the best-performing neural network.
3.1 Hierarchical Binary Relevance Method

Hierarchical Binary Relevance (HBR)

is a simple
method proposed by Tsoumakas et al. in [39] for exploit-
ing hierarchical label relations in a multi-label classiﬁer. In
our case, we implemented HBR by augmenting each level’s
tissue types during training with their ancestor types as a
ﬂat classiﬁcation problem. At test time, we obtained op-
timal thresholds θi for all nodes through ROC analysis of

2http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/projects/ADP/

11751

the validation set, and then zeroed all node scores in the
test set with any non-conﬁdent ancestor node predictions
(pi < θi). For example, if the predicted score pC was be-
low θC , then its child node score pC.D would be zeroed. In
this way, HBR penalizes the network less during training
for predicting a wrong tissue type hierarchically close to
the target tissue type than one hierarchically distant; it also
prevents the network from predicting tissue types with non-
conﬁdent ancestor node predictions at test time.

3.2 Training Setup

For the following experiments, training was conducted in
Keras (TensorFlow backend) with an NVIDIA GTX 1080
Ti GPU. The following Keras implementations of the net-
works were used: VGG163, ResNet184, and Inception-
V35. Images were resized from original scan size (no pyra-
mid image is used) to each networks’ accepted input size
(ranging from 224×224 to 229×229) using bilinear down-
sampling method; all networks were trained for 80 epochs
with a batch size of 32, and ℓ2 regularization weight de-
cay of 0.0005 on all convolutional and dense layers. More-
over, we utilized a stochastic gradient descent optimizer
with cyclical learning rate (resetting-triangular policy) [36]
in order to adopt the optimum learning rate for our pro-
posed database.
Initial base learning rate was 0.001 and
initial max learning rate was 0.02 for all the networks, step
size was 4 epochs, and learning rates were halved every
20 epochs. The training/validation/test split was 80-10-10
(refer to Table 3 for more information), data augmenta-
tion (horizontal/vertical ﬂip) was used, and class weight-
ing was applied to the binary cross-entropy loss ǫ(y, p) =
− Pk
i=1 wi (yi log(pi) + (1 − yi) log(1 − pi)). Here, the
class weight is deﬁned by wi = N/ni, with N being the
training set size and ni being the class example count, target
label vector y ∈ {0, 1}k, and predicted score vector p ∈ Rk
in k conﬁguration-speciﬁc labels. For more information on
the training progress please refer to supplementary mate-
rials. The Keras implementation of the training networks
including all pre-trained models can be obtained from6, 7.

3.3 Patch-Level Analysis

Figure 3 demonstrates the multi-label classiﬁcation ROC
curves in different hierarchical levels. The predicted scores
here are obtained by evaluating the validation set using the
VGG16-L3+HBP trained model, which was observed to
perform the best at level 3. The ROC curves of level-2 and
level-3 are overlaid with and without HBP augmented la-
beling. The vertical axis of each ROC curve corresponds to
the true positive rate (TPR), i.e. sensitivity, and the hori-
zontal axis corresponds to the false positive rate (FPR), i.e.
1 - speciﬁcity. Here, the horizontal axis is shown in log-
arithmic scale for better visual comparison between class
labels. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROCs is reason-
ably high for all trained networks, where the average AUC
for level-1, level-2, level-2+HBP, level-3, level-3+HBP are
0.992, 0.9885, 0.9813, 0.9867, and 0.9812, respectively.
Overall, the sensitivity decreases in the lower hierarchical
levels as a result of the corresponding increase in the num-
ber of classes. It is worth noting that we observe noticeable
improvements in the sensitivity on level-3 (shown in Fig-
ure 3(c)) from using HBP, which suggests that exploiting
a priori hierarchical knowledge is beneﬁcial for predictive
performance. Confusion matrices are also provided in the
supplementary materials.

The quantitative performances of all three neural net-
works trained on ﬁve different conﬁgurations are listed

and label conﬁguration, we have obtained optimum thresh-

olds using the corresponding ROC analysis. The accuracy
(ACC) results are consistently high (above 0.95) across all
combinations. Note that, using the mean precision (F1-
score) and missing rate (FNR) as evaluation metrics, adding
HBP improves predictive performance in the lower lev-
els and VGG16 out-performs out-performs ResNet18 and
Inception-V3. We hypothesize that VGG16’s superior per-
formance is due to the reduced number of layers (16 in-
stead of 18 and 48 respectively), which has been shown to
correspond to a smaller effective receptive ﬁeld for the ﬁ-
nal convolutional layer [22]. This is crucial because, as
opposed to general image recognition databases such as
MS-COCO and ImageNet, where better prediction of large
objects is usually achieved by using deeper layers to im-
prove viewpoint- and scale-invariance, the tissue structures
to be recognized in our Atlas database seem to be small
viewpoint- and scale-invariant textures, so using deeper lay-
ers will be redundant and may even promote overﬁtting.

3.4 Failure Modes

From the quantitative performance results shown above,
it is clear that the quality of the tissue type labeling is suf-
ﬁcient for consistently accurate prediction by deep neural
networks. But what about the minority of patches that
the neural networks fail to accurately predict? To answer
this, we sorted the test set patches by unweighted binary
cross-entropy loss and examined the class discordance be-
tween target labels and predicted scores (using the best-
performing VGG16-level-3+HBR conﬁguration). Overall,
we observed that almost all failure mode patches were in-
correctly annotated, that the neural network still predicts the
correct labels, and these labeling mistakes corresponded to
those observed by the validating pathologist. They can be
grouped as: (1) fundamental mislabeling errors (i.e.
tis-
sue type consistently mistaken for another) and (2) human

mislabeling errors (i.e. tissue type inconsistently omitted).
In Figure 4, four characteristic patches demonstrating se-
lect failure modes (one human error, three fundamental er-
rors) are shown with their discordance plots. In Figure 3.4,
E.M.S (Simple Squamous) is mislabeled as E.M.U (Simple
Cuboidal) and H.E (Erythrocytes) is omitted; in Figure 3.4,
fundic gland G.O (Exocrine Gland) is mislabeled as G.N
(Endocrine Gland); in Figure 3.4, tangentially cut gland
G.O (Exocrine Gland) is mislabeled with E.T.U (Stratiﬁed
Cuboidal); and in Figure 3.4, the glandular E.M.O (Simple
Columnar) is mislabeled as E.M.U (Simple Cuboidal). Fur-
ther statistical analysis on the failure modes are provided in
the supplementary materials.

3.5 Slide-Level Analysis

In this section, we analyze the predictive performance of
the best-performing neural network (VGG16-level-3+HBR)
for the patch-level resolution prediction of tissue types in
a whole slide image (WSI). As the image size of WSIs is
very large (a digital slide of 1cm-by-1cm tissue scanned
at 40X resolution is roughly 100K× 100K pixels in size),
this demonstrates in a visual manner that the trained net-
work in its present state is already a useful visual attention
aid for pathologists in localizing the regions of tissue rel-
evant to the diagnosis at hand, thus simplifying their work
and enabling faster diagnosis. We have selected three differ-

ent WSIs known to originate from the Gastro-Intestinal (GI)
tract and used them for our case study. Note that these slides
are completely separate from the proposed Atlas database
and have not been used for training, validating, or testing the
neural networks. Each WSI is divided into multiple patches
of 1088 × 1088 (excluding background patches), down-
sampled to 224 × 224, and fed into the trained CNN model
(VGG16-level-3+HBR) explained in previous sections. The
CNN outputs one conﬁdence score for each predicted tissue
type at a given patch, and the patch predictions are stitched
together into a slide-level class conﬁdence heatmap, which
is overlaid on the whole slide image with transparency cor-
responding to the conﬁdence level. In Figure 5, 24 differ-
ent conﬁdence score heatmaps are displayed for four differ-
ent WSIs, each with eight tissue types. For instance, the
White Adipose prediction conﬁdence is visualized for all
three WSIs in Figures 5(f), 5(n), and 5(v). Further results
on the slide level analysis are provided in the supplementary
materials.

4 Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we presented a new digital pathology
database of slide patch images annotated with histological
tissue types arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy. Given the
lack of publicly-available databases of patch-level images
annotated with a large range of histological tissue types,
which constrains current computational pathology research
to focus on particular diseases and organs, we propose that
our database will enable research into generalized tissue
type supervised learning. We demonstrated the quality of
our patch annotations by consulting an expert pathologist
and by training three state-of-the-art neural networks, both
of which suggest that the data is of sufﬁciently good quality
to be used for developing a useful computational pathology
tool. As a proof of concept, we developed a slide-level tis-
sue type-based visual attention aid and we hypothesize that
the presented database could be readily applied in the future
to solving related computational pathology tasks.
