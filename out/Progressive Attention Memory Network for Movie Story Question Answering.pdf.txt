Abstract

This paper proposes the progressive attention memory
network (PAMN) for movie story question answering (QA).
Movie story QA is challenging compared to VQA in two as-
pects: (1) pinpointing the temporal parts relevant to answer
the question is difﬁcult as the movies are typically longer
than an hour, (2) it has both video and subtitle where dif-
ferent questions require different modality to infer the an-
swer. To overcome these challenges, PAMN involves three
main features: (1) progressive attention mechanism that uti-
lizes cues from both question and answer to progressively
prune out irrelevant temporal parts in memory, (2) dynamic
modality fusion that adaptively determines the contribution
of each modality for answering the current question, and (3)
belief correction answering scheme that successively cor-
rects the prediction score on each candidate answer. Exper-
iments on publicly available benchmark datasets, MovieQA
and TVQA, demonstrate that each feature contributes to our
movie story QA architecture, PAMN, and improves perfor-
mance to achieve the state-of-the-art result. Qualitative
analysis by visualizing the inference mechanism of PAMN
is also provided.

1. Introduction

Humans have an innate cognitive ability to infer from
different sensory inputs to answer questions of 5W’s and
1H involving who, what, when, where, why and how, and it
has been a quest of mankind to duplicate this ability on ma-
chines. In recent years, studies on question answering (QA)
have successfully beneﬁted from deep neural networks, and
showed remarkable performance improvement on textQA
[24, 30], imageQA [2, 3, 19, 31], videoQA [8, 11, 32, 34].
This paper considers movie story QA [15, 18, 21, 26, 29]
that aims at a joint understanding of vision and language by
answering questions about movie contents and storyline af-
ter observing temporally-aligned video and subtitle. Movie

story QA is challenging compared to VQA in following two
aspects: (1) pinpointing the temporal parts relevant to an-
swer the question is difﬁcult as the movies are typically
longer than an hour and (2) it has both video and subtitle
where different questions require different modality to infer
the answer.

The ﬁrst challenge of movie story QA is that it involves
long videos that are possibly longer than an hour which
hinders pinpointing the required temporal parts. The in-
formation in the movie required to answer the question is
not distributed uniformly across the temporal axis. To ad-
dress this issue, memory networks [24] have widely been
accepted in QA tasks [21, 24, 26, 30]. The attention mech-
anism have widely been adopted to retrieve the information
relevant to the question. We observed that single-step atten-
tion on memory networks [21, 26] often generates blurred
temporal attention map.

The second challenge of movie story QA is that it in-
volves both video and subtitle where different questions re-
quire different modality to infer the answer. Each modality
may convey essential information for different questions,
and optimally fusing them is an important problem. For ex-
ample in the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, an-
swering the question “What does Indy do to the grave rob-
bers at the beginning of the movie?” would require video
modality rather than subtitle modality while the question
“How has the guard managed to stay alive for 700 years?”
would require subtitle modality. Existing multi-modal fu-
sion methods [7, 14, 15] only focus on modeling rich in-
teractions between the modalities. However, these methods
are question-agnostic in that the fusion process is not con-
ditioned on the question.

To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper
proposes Progressive Attention Memory Network (PAMN)
for movie story QA. PAMN contains three main features;
(1) progressive attention mechanism for pinpointing re-
quired temporal parts, (2) dynamic modality fusion for
adaptively fusing modalities conditioned on question and
(3) belief correction answering scheme. Progressive atten-
tion mechanism utilizes cues from both question and an-

18337

swers to prune out irrelevant temporal parts for each mem-
ory. While iteratively taking question and answers for tem-
poral attention generation, memories are progressively up-
dated to accumulate cues to locate relevant temporal parts
for answering the question. Compared to stacked attention
[6, 31], progressive attention considers multiple sources
(e.g., Q and A) and multiple targets (e.g., video and subtitle
memory) in a single framework. Dynamic modality fusion
aggregates the outputs from each memory by adaptively de-
termining the contribution of each modality. Conditioned
on the current question, the contribution is obtained by soft-
attention mechanism. Fusing multi-modal data by bilinear
operations [4, 7, 14] often requires heavy computation or
large number of parameters. Dynamic modality fusion efﬁ-
ciently integrate video and subtitle modality by discarding
worthless information from unnecessary modality. Belief
correction answering scheme successively corrects the pre-
diction score of each candidate answer. When humans solve
questions, they typically read content, question and answers
multiple times in an iterative manner [10]. This observation
is modeled by belief correction answering scheme. The pre-
diction score (logits), which this paper refers to a belief, is
equally likely initialized and successively corrected com-
pared to existing answering scheme [15, 21, 29] which uses
single-step answering scheme.

The main contribution of this paper is summarized as fol-
lows. (1) This paper proposes a movie story QA architec-
ture referred to as PAMN that tackles major challenges of
movie story QA with three features; progressive attention,
dynamic modality fusion and belief correction answering
scheme. (2) PAMN achieves the state-of-the-art results on
MovieQA dataset. Both the quantitative and qualitative re-
sults exhibit the beneﬁts and potential of PAMN.

2. Related Work

2.1. Visual Question Answering

Despite the short history, imageQA enjoys large num-
ber of datasets including VQA [3], COCO-QA [23] and Vi-
sual7W [35]. Attention mechanism is widely used to locate
the visual clues relevant to the question. Stacked Atten-
tion Network (SAN) [31] utilizes stacked attention mod-
ule to query an image multiple times to infer the answer
progressively. The Dual Attention Network (DAN) [22]
jointly leverages visual and textual attention mechanisms
to localize key information from both image and question.
Recently, applying bilinear operation showed promising re-
sults on imageQA. Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling
(MCB) [7] utilized bilinear operation to fuse image and
question features in imageQA. To reduce the computa-
tional complexity, MCB uses the sampling-based approx-
imation. To further reduce the feature dimension, Multi-
modal Low-rank Bilinear Attention Network (MLB) [14]

utilizes Hadamard product in the common space with two
low-rank projection matrices. Multimodal Tucker Fusion
[4] utilizes tucker decomposition [27] to efﬁciently param-
eterize bilinear interactions between visual and textual rep-
resentation.

VideoQA is a natural extension of imageQA as video
can be seen as temporal extension of image. Large-scale
videoQA benchmarks such as TGIF-QA [11] and ‘ﬁll-in-
the-blank’ [34] have boosted the research on videoQA.
Spatio-temporal VQA (ST-VQA) [11] generates spatial and
temporal attention to localize which regions in a frame and
which frames in a video to attend, respectively. Yu et al.
[32] proposed Joint Sequence Fusion (JSFusion) that mea-
sures semantic similarity between video and language. JS-
Fusion utilizes hierarchical attention mechanism that learns
matching representation patterns between modalities.

2.2. Movie Story Question Answering

A recent direction in videoQA leverages text modality
such as subtitle in addition to video modality for story un-
derstanding. To this end, various video story QA bench-
marks such as PororoQA [16], MeMexQA [12], TVQA
[17] and MovieQA [26] have been suggested. Numerous
researches have tackled MovieQA benchmark which pro-
vides movie clip, subtitle and other various textual descrip-
tions. Tapaswi et al. [26] divided the movie into multiple
sub-shots and utilized memory network (MemN2N) [24] to
store video and subtitle features into memory slots. Deep
Embedded Memory Network (DEMN)
[16] reconstructs
stories from a joint stream of scene-dialogue using a la-
tent embedding space and retrieves information which is
relevant to the question. Na et al.
[21] proposed Read-
Write Memory Network (RWMN) which is a CNN-based
memory network where video and subtitle features are ﬁrst
fused using bilinear operation, then write/read networks
store/retrieve information, respectively.

Liang et al. [18] proposed Focal Visual-Text Attention
(FVTA) that utilizes the hierarchical attention applied to a
three-dimensional tensor to localize evidential image and
text snippets. Layered Memory Network (LMN) [29] uti-
lizes Static Word Memory module and Dynamic Subtitle
Memory module to learn frame-level and clip-level repre-
sentations. The hierarchically formed movie representation
encodes the correspondence between words and frames,
and the temporal alignment between sentences and frames.
Multimodal Dual Attention Memory (MDAM) [15] utilizes
multi-head attention mechanism [28] and question attention
to learn the latent concepts of multimodal contents. Mul-
timodal fusion is performed once after the attention pro-
cess. Compared to existing architectures on movie story QA
that adopt single-step reasoning, PAMN provides multi-step
reasoning approach to localize necessary information from
question, answers, and movie contents.

3. Progressive Attention Memory Network

This section describes the proposed Progressive Atten-
tion Memory Network (PAMN). Fig. 1 shows the overall
architecture of PAMN, which fully utilizes diverse sources
of information (video, subtitle, question and candidate an-
swers) to answer the question. The pipeline of PAMN is as
follows. First, video and subtitle are embedded into dual
memory as in Fig. 1(a) that holds independent memories
for each modality. Then, progressive attention mechanism
pinpoints temporal parts that are relevant to answering the
question as in Fig. 1(b). To infer the correct answer, dy-
namic modality fusion in Fig. 1(c) adaptively integrates
outputs of each memory by considering contribution of each
modality. Belief correction answering scheme successively
corrects the belief of each answer from equally likely ini-
tialized belief as in Fig. 1(d).

3.1. Problem Setup

The formal deﬁnition of the problem is as follows. The
inputs of PAMN are (1) a question representation q ∈
R300, (2) ﬁve candidate answer representations {ai}5
i=1 ∈
R5×300, (3) temporally aligned video (v) and subtitle (s)

representation {(vi, si)}T
i=1 on the whole movie. Each ele-
ment of subtitle representation si corresponds to the dialog
sentence of a character and each element of video repre-
sentation vi is extracted from temporally aligned video clip.
The number of overall sentences of the movie is denoted as
T . The detailed explanation on extracting visual and tex-
tual feature is provided in Section 4.2. The objective is to
maximize the following likelihood:

arg maxθ X

D

log P (y|v, s, q, a; θ),

(1)

where θ denotes learnable model parameters, D represents
dataset and y represents the correct answer.

3.2. Dual Memory Embedding

As depicted in Fig. 1(a), the inputs are ﬁrst mapped to
an embedding space. The question representation q and
candidate answer representations {ai}5
i=1 are embedded to
a common space by weight-shared linear fully connected
(FC) layer with parameters Wug ∈ R300×d and bug ∈ Rd,
to yield question embedding u ∈ Rd and answer embed-
ding g ∈ R5×d where d denotes the memory dimension.

8339

Video representation v and subtitle representation s are
embedded independently to generate video memory Mv
and subtitle memory Ms. This dual memory structure en-
ables pinpointing different temporal parts for each modality.
To reﬂect the observation that the adjacent video clips often
have strong correlations, we utilized the average pooling
(Avg.Pool) layer to store the adjacent representations into
a single memory slot.

As the ﬁrst step of dual memory embedding, feed-
forward neural network (FFN) composed of two linear FC
layers with ReLU non-linearity in between is applied to em-
bed video and subtitle representation. This operates on ev-
ery element of v and s independently. Then, average pool-
ing layer is applied to model neighboring representations
together, forming video memory Mv and subtitle memory
Ms, i.e. dual memory:

FFN(x) = ReLU(xW1 + b1)W2 + b2,

Mv = Avg.Pool(FFN(v); θp, θs),
Ms = Avg.Pool(FFN(s); θp, θs),

(2)

(3)

(4)

where θp and θs denotes the size and stride of the pooling,
x indicates the each input and W, b denotes the weight
and bias of feed-forward neural network. Finally, generated
video and subtitle memory are Mv, Ms ∈ RN ×d where
N = ⌈T /θs⌉.

3.3. Progressive Attention Mechanism

The progressive attention mechanism in Fig. 1(b) takes
dual memory Mv, Ms, question embedding u and answer
embedding g as inputs, and progressively attends and up-
dates the dual memory. While iteratively taking question
and answers for temporal attention generation, memories
are progressively updated to accumulate cues to locate rel-
evant temporal parts for answering the question. We ob-
served that single-step temporal attention on memory net-
works [26, 21] often generates blurry attention map. The
multi-step nature of progressive attention mechanism en-
ables generating sharper attention distribution. Unneces-
sary information from memory is ﬁltered out at each iter-
ation.

The ﬁrst step of progressive attention mechanism is tem-
poral attention by question embedding u. The attention
weights are obtained by calculating the cosine similarity be-
tween each memory slot and question embedding u as in
Eqs.5, 6. The dual memory is multiplied by the attention
weights and is followed by linear FC layer to be updated
as in Eqs.7, 8. The attention operates independently for the
video memory Mv and the subtitle memory Ms:

αv
M u = softmax(uMv⊺),
αs
M u = softmax(uMs⊺),
M u ⊙ Mv)Wv
Mv ← (αv
Ms ← (αs
M u ⊙ Ms)Ws

M u + bv
M u + bs

M u,
M u,

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

M u, αs

where αv
M u ∈ RN denote the temporal attention
weight for Mv, Ms, respectively. The learnable parame-
ters for linear FC layer is denoted by WM u, bM u , ← in-
dicates the update operation and ⊙ represents the element-
wise multiplication with broadcasting on appropriate axis.

The second step of progressive attention mechanism is
temporal attention by answers. This step is similar to the
ﬁrst step except it utilizes answer embedding g to attend
updated dual memory Mv, Ms:

αv
M g = softmax(gMv⊺),
M g = softmax(gMs⊺),
αs
Mv ← (αv
M g ⊙ Mv)Wv
M g ⊙ Ms)Ws
Ms ← (αs

M g + bv
M g + bs

M g and αs

M g ∈ R5×N denote the temporal atten-
where αv
tion weights for dual memory and Mv, Ms ∈ R5×N ×d rep-
resent the updated video and subtitle memory, respectively.
Multiple Hops Extension. As described above, the pro-
gressive attention mechanism attends the dual memory only
once for each attention step. In this case, the dual memory
may contain much irrelevant information and lack capabil-
ity to query complicated semantics to answer the question.
Progressive attention can be naturally extended to utilize
multiple hops [24] for ﬁne-grained extraction of abstract
concepts and reasoning of high-level semantics.

Different from the memory network [24] that utilizes the
sum of the output ok and query uk of k-th hop as the query
of next hop, we use the same question embedding u with
updated dual memory M(k) for k-th hop. Each attention
step in Eqs. 5-8, 9-12 is repeated hM u, hM g times, respec-
tively. Each attend and update operations can be expressed
as:

α(k) = softmax(xM(k−1)⊺),
M(k) ← (α(k) ⊙ M(k−1))W(k) + b(k),

(13)

(14)

where the subscripts and superscripts corresponding to each
equation are omitted to avoid repetition, and x indicates u
or g for each step of progressive attention.

3.4. Dynamic Modality Fusion

Dynamic modality fusion in Fig. 1(c) aggregates dual
memory into fused output o at the end of each progressive
attention step. Different question requires different modal-
ity to infer the answer. Consider the question ”What drink
bottle is at the table when Robin, Lily, Marshall and Ted
are talking to each other?”. In this case, the video modality
would be more important than subtitle modality. Similar to
modality attention [9, 13], dynamic modality fusion is soft-
attention based algorithm that determines the contribution
of each modality for answering the question.

Given dual memory Mv, Ms, dynamic modality fusion
ﬁrst sum each memory along temporal axis and compute

8340

cosine similarity with question embedding u to calculate
attention score.:

om =

N

X

n=1

Mm,

αDMF = softmax(u[ov; os]⊺),

(15)

(16)

where m indicates each modality v or s, om represents the
output of each memory, N denotes the temporal length of
dual memory, and αDMF denotes attention weights. Finally,
the fused output o is computed by weighted summing be-
tween attention weight and memory output:

o = X

αm
DMFom.

m

(17)

The learned attention weight can be interpreted as contri-
bution or importance of each modality on answering the
question. By regulating the ratio of each modality on fused
output, dynamic modality fusion leads to stable learning by
discarding information from unnecessary modality.

3.5. Belief Correction Answering Scheme

Belief correction answering scheme in Fig. 1(d) se-
lects the correct answer among ﬁve candidate answers.
Rather than determining the prediction score once, belief
correction answering scheme successively corrects predic-
tion score by observing diverse source of information. This
mimics the multi-step reasoning process of human answer-
ing difﬁcult questions [10]. Combined with progressive at-
tention and dynamic modality fusion, this multi-step rea-
soning approach of PAMN strengthens the model’s ability
to extract high-level meaning from the multimodal data.

Belief B ∈ R5 denotes the prediction score on the can-
didate answers. The prediction probability z ∈ R5 is com-
puted by normalizing the belief, and the answer y is pre-
dicted with the highest probability:

z = softmax(B),
y = arg maxi∈[5](zi).

(18)

(19)

One way of initializing belief would be null initialization
that endows all candidate answers with equal probabilities
before observing any information. To reﬂect this unbiased
initialization, the belief B is initialized as zero vector.

Belief correction answering scheme adopts three-step
belief correction; u-, Mu- and Mg-correction. For each cor-
rection step, the belief is corrected by accumulating the sim-
ilarity between answer embedding g and the observed in-
formation. Belief is ﬁrst corrected by only considering the
question, i.e. u-correction. The intuition is that human often
builds prior biases after skimming through only the question
and candidate answers:

Bu = ug⊺,
B ← B + Bu.

(20)

(21)

Then for Mu- and Mg-correction, the outputs of ﬁrst and
second progressive attention steps, oM u and oM g, are con-
sidered. Again, the similarities between answer embedding
g are computed:

BM u = oM ug⊺,
BM g,i = oM g,ig⊺
i .

Finally, the belief is corrected to infer correct answer:

B ← B + βM uBM u,
B ← B + βM gBM g,

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

where the correction weights βM u, βM g are hyper param-
eters that scales corresponding belief correction. Note that
the belief is normalized to have unit norm after each correc-
tion.

4. Experiments

4.1. Dataset

MovieQA [26] benchmark is constructed for movie
story QA which consists various sources of information
such as movie clip, subtitle, plot synopses, scripts and DVS
transcriptions. MovieQA dataset contains 408 movies with
corresponding 14,944 multiple-choice questions. MovieQA
benchmark consists of 6 tasks according to which sources to
be used. This paper focuses on video+subtitles task which
is the only task utilizing movie clip. Since only 140 movies
contain video clips, there are 6,462 question-answer pairs
which splits into 4,318 training, 886 validation and 1,258
test samples.

TVQA [17] benchmark is video story QA dataset on TV
show domain. It consists of total 152.5k question-answer
pairs on six TV shows: The Big Bang Theory, How I Met
Your Mother, Friends, Grey’s Anatomy, House, Castle. Each
split of TVQA contains 122k, 15.25k, 15.25k for train, val-
idation and test, respectively. Unlike MovieQA which con-
siders whole movie as input, TVQA contains 21,793 short
clips of 60/90 seconds segmented from the original TV
show for question-answering.

4.2. Feature extraction

For fair comparison, we extracted visual and textual fea-
tures similar to previous works [21, 26] and ﬁxed them dur-
ing training.

Textual feature Each sentence from question, candidate
answers and subtitle are divided into sequence of words,
then each word is embedded by skip-gram model [20] pro-
vided by Tapaswi et al. [26] which is trained on MovieQA
plot synopses. In order to encode the order of words within
a sentence, position encoding (PE) [24] is utilized to ob-
tain textual feature. For example in the case of question,

Visual feature Movies are divided into video clips that
are temporally aligned with each sentence of the subtitle.
The frames are sampled from each video clip with the rate
of 1 fps. Then, frame feature of size 1536 is extracted
from “Average Pooling” layer on Inception-v4 [25]. Finally,
mean-pooling over all frame features from the correspond-
ing video clip produces the visual feature, vi ∈ R1536.

4.3. Implementation details

The entire architecture was implemented using Tensor-
ﬂow [1] framework. All the results reported in this paper
were obtained using the Adagrad optimizer [5] with a mini-
batch size of 32 and the learning rate of 0.001. All the ex-
periments were performed under CUDA acceleration with
single NVIDIA TITAN Xp (12GB of memory) GPU. In all
the experiments, the recommended train / validation / test
split was strictly observed.

Table 1 compares the validation and test accuracy on the
MovieQA benchmark of Video+Subtitles task. We compare
the performance of PAMN with other state-of-the-art archi-
tecture. The ground-truth answers for MovieQA test set are
not observable and the evaluation on the test set can only be
performed once every 72 hours through an online evalua-
tion. On MovieQA benchmark, PAMN exhibits the state-of-
the-art results by attaining test accuracy of 42.53%. It out-
performs the runner-up, MDAM [15] (41.41%) by 1.12%
and the third place, LMN [29] (39.03%) by 3.50%. Note
the MDAM is an ensemble of 20 different models, while
PAMN is a single model.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of each modality,
experiments based on using only video and subtitle were
also conducted: PAMN w/o Sub and PAMN w/o Vid. From
near random-guess performances of SSCB w/o Sub [26]
and MemN2N w/o Sub [26] as shown in Table. 1, it is no-
ticed that movie story understanding is difﬁcult using only
video. The PAMN w/o Sub attains large performance gain
of 19.23% compared to MemN2N w/o Sub. It even achieves
performance comparable to LMN [29] which exploits both
video and subtitle. PAMN understands movie story even
without observing subtitle. From Table.1, it is noticed that
PAMN performs better than PAMN w/o Vid and PAMN w/o
Sub which indicates both video and subtitle provides con-
ducive information in improving prediction.

Table 2 shows performance comparison on TVQA
benchmark without timestamp annotation. In this experi-
ment, we utilized the video and text features extracted by
Lei et al. [17] (i.e. ImageNet and visual concept feature for
video and GloVe feature for text) for fair comparison. Fur-
ther, we encoded the sentence feature using LSTM instead
of position encoding. On TVQA benchmark, PAMN out-
performs state-of-the-art result by attaining test accuracy of
66.77% with visual concept feature.

4.5. Ablation Study

Table. 3 summarizes the ablation analysis of PAMN
on the validation set of MovieQA benchmark in order to
measure the validity of the key components of PAMN. To
measure to effectiveness of progressive attention mecha-
nism, each temporal attention step of PAMN w/o PA uti-
lizes dual memory obtained in Eqs. 3,4, i.e. PAMN w/o
PA do not accumulate cues and each attention step oper-
ates in a parallel manner. PAMN w/o Multiple Hop attends
dual memory only once for each temporal attention step.
As shown in the ﬁrst block of Table. 3, PAMN w/o PA
underperforms PAMN, which shows that the attention ac-
cumulation by progressive attention mechanism is impor-
tant in understanding movie story. Multiple hops extension
is also crucial in attaining the best possible performance.
For ablating dynamic modality fusion, we experiment with

stead of dynamic modality fusion, respectively. As shown
in the second block of Table. 3, fusing modalities by aver-
aging or bilinear operations show lower performance than
dynamic modality fusion. This implies that question de-
pendent modality weighting (i.e. dynamic modality fusion)
helps strengthens conducive modality. To measure the ef-
fectiveness of belief correction answering scheme, the third

variants: PAMN w/o Mu,Mg-correction, PAMN w/o Mg-
correction, and PAMN w/o Mu-correction. It is noteworthy
that only using QA pairs shows much higher performance
that the random baseline of 20%. Considering M u- and
M g-correction, PAMN w/o Mg-correction shows 2.26%
and PAMN w/o Mu-correction shows 1.36% performance
boosts, respectively.

Table. 4 summarizes the performance variation depend-
ing on three sets of hyperparameters; the number of hops for
attention by question u and answer g, θp, θs: size and stride
of Avg. Pool layer, and βM u, βM g: correction weights for
belief correction module. The multiple hops extension with
2-repetitions exhibits the best validation performance for
PAMN. The multiple hops extension with more than three
repetitions may suffer from overﬁtting due to the small size
of dataset. The performance is positively affected by in-
creasing θp and θs, but it degrades for large θp and θs due
to information blurring of Avg. Pool. We observed that
there is no best-performing optimal correction weights. If
the question representation u has enough information about
where in the movie to focus on, βM u should be higher, and
vice versa. Furthermore, it is preferable to have smaller
βM g than βM u since large value of βM g dilates the effect
of ug and Mu correction since the normalization is applied
in between every belief correction.

The Fig. 2 illustrates the selected qualitative examples
of PAMN. Each example provides the temporal attention
map αv
M g from progressive attention mechanism, the
ground-truth (GT) temporal part where the question was
generated from, the attention weights αv
DM F from
dynamic modality fusion, and the inference path of be-
lief correction answering scheme. The generated tempo-
ral attention well matches with the GT which indicates that
PAMN successively learns where to attend. The weights
αv
DMF adaptively scales depending on the question
type which implies that PAMN learns what modality to use
without additional supervision. For some cases, PAMN pre-
dicts the correct answer at the u-correction step while for
other cases the correct answer is determined at the last (Mg)
step. PAMN is an interpretable architecture in that the infer-
ence path and the attention map provide the trace of where
PAMN attends and what information source it used to an-
swer the question.

cial situation get worse and worse?). We observed that
PAMN outperforms MemN2N and RWMN on the major-
ity of question types. Especially, PAMN attains 20% and
13% performance boosts on when, where questions, respec-
tively which implies the superiority of PAMN to pinpoint
the movie story.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, a movie story question answering (QA)
architecture referred to as Progressive Attention Memory
Network (PAMN) was proposed. The main challenges of
movie story QA were summarized as: (1) pinpointing the
temporal parts relevant to answer the question is difﬁcult
(2) different questions require different modality to infer the
answer. Proposed PAMN make use of three main features to
tackle aforementioned challenges: (1) progressive attention
mechanism, (2) dynamic modality fusion and (3) belief cor-
rection answering scheme. We empirically demonstrated
that proposed PAMN is valid by showing the state-of-the-art
performance on MovieQA and TVQA benchmark dataset.
