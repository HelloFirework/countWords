Abstract

The reconstruction and analysis of tree-like topological
structures in the biomedical images is crucial for biologists
and surgeons to understand biomedical conditions and plan
surgical procedures. The underlying tree-structure topology
reveals how different curvilinear components are anatomi-
cally connected to each other. Existing automated topology
reconstruction methods have great difﬁculty in identifying
the connectivity when two or more curvilinear components
cross or bifurcate, due to their projection ambiguity, imag-
ing noise and low contrast.
In this paper, we propose a
novel curvilinear structural similarity measure to guide a
dominant-set clustering approach to address this indispens-
able issue. The novel similarity measure takes into account
both intensity and geometric properties in representing the
curvilinear structure locally and globally, and group curvi-
linear objects at crossover points into different connected
branches by dominant-set clustering. The proposed method
is applicable to different imaging modalities, and quantita-
tive and qualitative results on retinal vessel, plant root, and
neuronal network datasets show that our methodology is ca-
pable of advancing the current state-of-the-art techniques.

1. Introduction

Accurate reconstruction of the pervasive tree-like struc-
tures commonly encountered in biomedical imagery, such
as blood vessels in medical images, the roots of plants
in color photography, or neuronal arbors in optical mi-
croscopy images, is a fundamental step in providing valu-
able clinical information in diagnosis of pathological con-

ditions [25, 30], revealing important information about the
delivery of nutrients to different plant tissues [14, 1], or
screening the neuronal connectivity to study the relation be-
tween neuronal structure and function [3, 26], respectively.
In consequence, extracting and representing the geometri-
cal (radii, lengths or tortuosity) and topological (branching
connectivity) properties of these tree-like structures is criti-
cal for diagnosis, or other analytic purposes.

Rapid development has taken place in the automatic ge-
ometric extraction of the properties of tree-like structures,
as evidenced by extensive reviews [16, 32]: but automated
topology reconstruction from a single, two-dimensional (2-
D) image of a three-dimensional (3-D) tree-structure is rel-
atively unexplored, and more challenging. The main reason
is that while a 3-D tree-structure projects readily to a 2-D
image plane, the problem of then reconstructing the topol-
ogy of the tree-like structure from it is ill-posed and error-
prone [14], due to their depth loss in projection, imaging
noise and low contrast in appearance and geometric struc-
tures.

The underlying tree-structure topology must be able to
identify and differentiate individual curvilinear objects from
the entire tree network. The top row of Figure 1 shows ex-
amples of tree-like structures in biomedical imagery:
the
bottom row gives their derived topological information.
Manual reconstruction of these tree-structure topologies is
time consuming, and commercial software, e.g., Vaa3D1,
still largely relies on manual annotation and so is subject to
human error [11]. Thus, the catalyst for the development of
algorithms for accurate automatic topology reconstruction
has been primarily the need to overcome time constraints
and avoid human error.

ing due to the projection [10]. Crossovers lead to difﬁculty
in predicting whether a given curvilinear object contacting
a crossover belongs to the same tree, or a different tree,
due both to their projective ambiguity and subtle changes in
appearance, contrast and geometry in the imaging process.
Moreover, the inhomogeneous intensity and poor contrast
due to imaging noise or uneven illumination, often leads to
a tree with apparent discontinuities, or with fuzzy bound-
aries, and which aggravates the difﬁculty in the estimation
of topology.

1.2. Proposed approach

Recently, it has been shown in [33] that the topology
of the retinal vessel tree can be estimated by exploiting the
concept of dominant set clustering, which formalizes the
task of topology estimation as a pairwise clustering prob-
lem. However, this method still makes topological mis-
takes, because it suffers from the fact that the dominant
set clustering approach uses the Euclidean distance at the
pixel level without attending to global properties, such as
tree shape. Such a similarity measure cannot fully capture
the structural information conveyed in terms of intensity or
shape.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel tree-
like structure topology reconstruction framework that works
automatically from a single 2-D image. In particular, we
focus on addressing the bottleneck crossover problem. The
proposed method includes three main contributions:

• The formalization of the topology reconstruction of a

tree-like structure from a single projective image.

• A novel curvilinear structural similarity measure is
introduced by aggregating three different similarities,
which together can take into account both intensity and
geometric properties to represent curvilinear structures
locally and globally. It ensures that the extracted simi-
larity is diverse in features.

• The re-conceptualization of the topology estimation
task as a pairwise clustering problem: a curvilinear
structural similarity-enabled dominant set clustering,
which proves to be an effective way of addressing the
problem of tracing branches at crossovers.

The proposed method has been validated quantitatively
using four publicly accessible datasets with three different
imaging modalities - microscopic images, retinal color fun-
dus images, and RGB source images.

1.1. Related works

Automated tree-structure topology reconstruction from
three-dimensional images is a well-posed problem [18],
and most existing efforts in tree-structure topology recon-
struction have focused on three-dimensional data, such as
the lung airways from computed tomography (CT) [6, 19],
cerebral vascular network from magnetic resonance an-
giogram (MRA) [4, 27], and nerves or neurons from mi-
croscopic image stacks [5]. However, topology estimation
from a single 2-D image of a 3-D tree-structure is more
challenging, and has received relatively little attention. To
the best of our knowledge, only a small number of studies
have addressed the topic directly.

The topological reconstruction of tree structures in neu-
ronal and retinal images was formalized as label propaga-
tion over a two step graph-theoretical approach by De et
al. [11, 12], and each tree branch could be separated from
the tree-like network. Cheng et al. [8] formed a directed
graph to represent the retinal vessel network. The entire
vessel graph was separated into several subgraphs with in-
dividual labels, by propagating tree labels from known root
nodes to the entire graph. Estrada et al. [14] regularized the
topology reconstruction task with a parametric tree-growth
model by using a heuristic search algorithm, and applied it
to the retinal vessels, plant roots and synthetic leafy trees.
The authors further utilized the topological information to
classify all the vessels into arteries or veins [13]. Dashtbo-
zorg et al. [10] proposed a graph-based approach for retinal
vessel topology estimation, and the vessel orientation and
angle features were used to group the nodes at crossover
into two pairs.

The automated methods so far developed often fail to
identify the connectivity correctly in instances of curvilin-
ear crossover: i.e., two curvilinear objects overlap or touch-

The proposed topology reconstruction approach for tree
structure requires a pre-processing step, which encom-
passes the following four phases.

Segmentation: The inﬁnite perimeter active contour
model using hybrid region information [34] was em-
ployed to automatically segment the tree-like structures.
(Note: this step may be skipped for some datasets where
manual annotation of the tree-like structures is provided
with the data source.)
Skeletonization: The center-
lines of tree-structures provide an accurate representa-
tion of their topologies. Therefore, an iterative morphol-
ogy thinning operation [2] is performed on the extracted
tree-structures to obtain a single-pixel-wide skeleton map.
Junction localization: The bifurcations, crossovers, and ﬁl-
ament ends (terminal points) may then be extracted from
the skeleton map by locating junction points (pixels with
more than two neighbors) and terminal points (pixels with
one neighbor). All the junction points and their neighbors
are then removed from the skeleton map, producing an im-
age with clearly separated segments. Junctions are catego-
rized into four groups, according to the number of points
involved in each junction - terminal points (1), connecting
points (2), bifurcation points (3), and crossovers/meeting
points (4 and above). The bracketed number indicates the
number of ﬁlament segments connected to each intersec-
tion. Graph generation: A graph can be generated from
the skeleton map by linking ﬁrst and last nodes in the same
segment. The typical misrepresentations from the generated
graph, such as node splitting, missing links and false links,
are corrected by employing a graph modiﬁcation approach
proposed in [10].

Fig. 2 (a)-(d) shows an example of the outline of the

graph preparation for retinal vessels.

2.2. Dominant set Clustering for Topology Recon 

struction

The concept of dominant sets arises from the study
of graph theory, by which a continuous formulation of
the maximum clique problem is deﬁned [23]. An undi-
rected graph G with weighted edges is represented by
G = (V, E, ω), where V is a set of nodes/pixels, edge
set E ⊆ V × V indicates all the possible connections, and
ω : E → R is the positive weight function and represents

the similarity among the pixels in V . A |V |×|V | symmetric
matrix A = (aij) is used to represent the weighted graph G
as an adjacency matrix.

A dominant set can be formally deﬁned based on the
values of similarity among nodes in V . Let S ⊆ V be a
nonempty subset of nodes, pi ∈ V and pj ∈ S. The rela-
tive similarity between pi and pj with respect to the average
similarity between pj and its neighbours in S is deﬁned as:

φS(i, j) = aij −

1

|S| Xpk∈S

ajk.

(1)

The edge weight deﬁnition plays a crucial role in the pro-
posed method. In [33], the inverse Euclidean distance be-
tween the two end points of an edge in the feature space is
used, where each node is represented as a 23-dimensional
feature vector. However, this approach lacks of robustness
due to failure to capture global characteristics. In our work,
aij is derived by a curvilinear structural similarity metric
which is aggregated from pixel level, region level, and geo-
metrical similarities. The derivation of this novel similarity
will be proposed below in Sec. 3.

It is known from deﬁnition that φS(i, j) in Eqn. (1) can
be either positive or negative. The weight of pi with regard
to S is assigned recursively as:

WS(i) =( 1

Ppj ∈S\{pi}

φS\{pi}(i, j)WS\{pi}(j)

if |S| = 1
otherwise.

(2)
where S \ {pi} indicates the nodes set S excluding the node
pi, and WS(i) expresses the similarity between node pi and
the nodes of S \ {pi} with respect to the mutual similarity
amongst the nodes in S \ {pi}. Finally, the total weight of

S is calculated by W (S) =Ppi∈S WS(i).

Formally, a non-empty subset of nodes S, S ⊆ V such
that W (S′) > 0 for any non-empty S′ ⊆ S is said to be a
dominant set if:

WS(i) > 0, for all pi ∈ S

In general, the weights of edges within the dominant set
of a edge-weighted graph should be large, representing high
internal homogeneity or similarity [23]. By contrast, the
weights of edges which link to the dominant sets externally
will be small. Therefore, the dominant set is a proper so-
lution to identify branches of a tree, because the similarity
of two points from the same branch should be large, while
that of two points belonging to different branches should be
small.

Dominant sets can be identiﬁed by local solutions of the

program:

and d = |I \ S|. A strict local solution x∗ of Eqn. (5) in-
dicates a dominant set S of G, where xi > 0 means that
the node in question pi ∈ S. An effective optimization ap-
proach for solving Eqn. (5) is given by the so-called repli-
cator dynamics [24]:

(6)

where i = 1, 2, · · · , |S|. It has been proven that for any ini-
tialization of x ∈ ∆, its trajectory will remain in ∆ with the
increase of iteration t. As t in Eqn. (6) increases, the ob-
jective function f (x) in Eqn. (5) is either strictly increasing
or constant. In practice, the stopping criterion of the dy-
namic system can be set as a maximal number of iteration

t, or as a minimal increment of f (x). Algorithm 1 shows
the complete procedure for partitioning a tree structure into
branches S.

It is worth noticing that a peeling-off strategy has been
i.e., this method iteratively extracts a subset of
adopted:
points belonging to the same branch (a dominant set S) each
time by using Eqn. (6) and repeating the process with the
remaining points within the intersection I = I \ S. The
identiﬁcation of different branches at an intersection is car-
ried out by identifying the most obvious branch ﬁrst, and
then the second most obvious, and so on. Therefore, the
peeling-off strategy is a direct, intuitive implementation of
this procedure [24].

3. Curvilinear structural similarity measure

The similarity metric aij = ω(i, j) in Algorithm 1 is as
yet to be deﬁned. In this section, we will detail this similar-
ity measure.

Traditional similarity measures, such as the Euclidean
distance, cannot fully capture the local and global, or
intensity-based and geometry-based structural information
of the given objects, and it is hard to provide reliable in-
formation for data clustering. Therefore, a ﬁne similarity
measure with informative local and global structural details
is essential in the reconstruction of a complicated tree-like
structure.
In this work, we adopt the concept of struc-
tural similarity (SSIM) [29], and re-conceptualize it as a
new tree-structural similarity measurement, which further
exploits the regional and geometric characteristics of curvi-
linear segments.

Two different curvilinear segments will be deemed to
be from the same tree branch if they satisfy the following
anatomical characteristics, which are supported by clinical
and biological evidences [21, 26, 14]:

• High local similarity: their local contrast is small;

• High global similarity: entire objects consist of similar

curvilinear compoenents;

• High geometric similarity: the global orientations and

tortuosity of the curvilinear object are similar.

In consequence, we propose a novel curvilinear struc-
tural similarity measure to satisfy the above properties. This
similarity measurement is aggregated from the similarity
measured at pixel level, region level, and geometrical level.

3.1. Pixel aware structural similarity measure

SSIM is a similarity measure that is able to compare the
local pattern of pixel intensities from the perspective of im-
age formation. Let u and v be the pixel values in the seg-
ments where the nodes pi and pj are located, respectively.

48508

Then the SSIM(i, j) of two segments containing nodes pi
and pj can be deﬁned as:

.

(u′

iv′

j)2 ·

2σui σvj

SSIM(i, j) =

2u′
j
i)2 + (v′

(σui )2 + (σvj )2 ·

σui uj
σui σvj
(7)
The three terms of SSIM are luminance, contrast, and struc-
tural components, respectively [29]. The u′, σu, v′, and
σv are the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values
of the two segments containing nodes pi and pj , respec-
tively, and σuv is the covariance between them. (Note, in
the real application, the size of the two curvilinear segments
are usually in different, as thus they are straightened and re-
sized into a certain shape.) It can be observed that the three
components are relatively independent. For example, the
smaller the difference between u′ and v′, or σu and σv, the
greater the similarity of luminance or contrast. Meanwhile,
the change of luminance or contrast will not affect the struc-
tures measurement. In [29], the structural similarity of two
different objects is equivalent to the correlation coefﬁcient
between u and v, and it is associated with the two normal-
ized vectors (u − u′)/σu and (v − v′)/σv.

3.2. Region aware structural similarity measure

The pixel level structural similarity measure discussed
above is mainly deﬁned by the intensity values of each
pixel, and so can capture local details of curvilinear objects.
However, a purely pixel level structural similarity measure
cannot well account for regional similarities [9, 15]. There-
fore, in this section, we propose a novel region level struc-
tural similarity measure.

Assume that the given segment i is partitioned into M
superpixels {pi
m}M
m=1, and segment j is superpixelized
n}N
into N patches {pj
M =1 using the Simple Linear Itera-
tive Clustering (SLIC) method. The region-aware structure
similarity (RSIM) of these two segments can be formulated
as:

RSIM(i, j) =

M

N

Xm=1

Xn=1

SSIM(pi

m, pj

n) · w(pi

m, pj

n), (8)

m, pj

where w(pi
n) is a standard Gaussian weighting func-
tion to model the local contrast in terms of geometric dis-
tances between superpixels m and n, so that local contrast
can be effectively combined with control over the inﬂuence
radius:

w(pi

m, pj

n) =

1
Z

exp{−

kpi

m − pj

2
nk

2σ2

},

(9)

where Z is

n=1,n6=m w(pi

the normalization term to ensure that
m, pj
n) = 1. The range of the regional sim-
ilarity may be controlled by the standard deviation σ2 from
0 to 1. Larger values of σ increase the spatial weighting of

PN

the distant segments, and vice versa. In our implementation,
we set σ2 = 0.3 empirically. The operator k · k indicates the
spatial distance between pi

m and pj
n.

The RSIM considers not only the local intensity values,
but also how the pixel values are distributed in each patch,
and how similar such distributions are between different
patches. This method treats patches (superpixels) instead as
units for similarity measurement by considering how sim-
ilar different patches are and comparing them directly to
each other [15] in order to determine their relative contrast
and similarity.

3.3. Geometry aware structural similarity measure

Dividing the intensity-based structural similarity into
pixel level and region level, helps in obtaining the object
structural similarity. However, in the ﬁeld of biomedical im-
age analysis, the object’s shape or geometry level similarity
is crucial to revealing abnormalities [35]. To this end, we
propose a novel geometrical structural similarity measure
(GSIM) in this work. This GSIM can capture the overall
geometry of a shape, or the tortuosity of a curvilinear com-
ponent, and is more robust to variation in imaging quality
and scale.

In our work, the shape index is proposed in order to cap-
ture the intuitive notion of ‘shape’ locally and globally [20].
The shape index E of each centerline pixel in a given seg-
ment may be deﬁned as

E =

2
π

arctan

C2 + C1
C2 − C1

,

(10)

where C1 and C2 are the curvatures of each side of a curvi-
linear segment. The curvature obtained from eigensystem
analysis of the Hessian matrix is commonly used in the
computation of vectors tangent to oriented structures [31].
The measurement of shape index in a 3D surface is better
able to represent the concavity or convexity of a given re-
gion, and in 2D or 1D applications, it may be employed to
reveal the global tortuosity of a given shape or curve.

The GSIM can be obtained by calculating the relative

distance between their arguments:

GSIM(i, j) = exp(cid:8)−

rd(E ′

j )2

i , E ′
2g2

(cid:9),

(11)

where E ′ indicates the mean shape index value of a seg-
ment, and g is a control parameter that is able to reveal how
distant pixels and dissimilar features will impact the shape
index of the current pixel: here, g2 = 3 is empirically cho-
sen. The relative distance rd(·) of two shape indices be-
tween two objects is deﬁned as:

rd(Ei, Ej) =

kEi, Ejk

avek⊂S(kEi, Ejk)

,

3.4. Similarity Fusion via OWA aggregation

Each of the three aforementioned curvilinear structural
similarity measures has disadvantages if used alone in real
applications. However, they can be aggregated to provide
a more robust solution. Weighted average operators (linear
summation, Hadamard product, average operator, etc.) are
commonly used to implement the aggregation process. In
this work, we formulate a combined curvilinear structural
similarity by using an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA)
operator to combat the scale and illumination change from
one segment to another.

The fundamental aspect of an OWA operator is the rank-
ing step, in which the extraneous variables are ranked in
descending order, with their values subsequently integrated
into a single aggregated value [28]. An OWA mapping
AOWA: Rq → R is deﬁned as

AOWA(a1, · · · , aQ) =

wqaπ(q),

(13)

Q

Xq=1

where aπ(q) is a permutation of aq, in which aπ(q) is the q-
th largest value of the aq. The ordering of input arguments
gives the OWA a nonlinear character. wq is a collection of

weights that satisﬁes Pq wq = 1, q = 1, · · · , Q, Q > 1.

Different choices of the weight w lead to different aggre-
gation results: in our work, w1 = 0.25, w2 = 0.35, and
w3 = 0.4 were chosen empirically. By applying the OWA
aggregation to a real problem of this kind, users will have
the degree of freedom to control both the t-transitivity of the
operator [28], by tuning the stress function, or by tuning the
weights in a weighting vector.

4. Datasets and Experimental Results

4.1. Datasets

Four tree-like image datasets were used in this work
to validate the effectiveness of our approach:
two neu-
ronal image datasets (NeuB1 and NeuB2 [11] ), one reti-
nal image dataset (WIDE [14]), and one plant root dataset
(RICE [14]).

The neuronal datasets NeuB1 and NeuB2 contain 112
and 98 neuronal images, respectively. (Note: images from
the NeuB2 dataset are more challenging, due to noise and
blurring.) The manual annotations of structure topology
were made by using the annotation tool Neuromantic2.

The WIDE dataset [14] comprises 15 high resolution
color fundus images, each of 3900×3072 pixels. The RICE
dataset [14] comprises of 18 rice-root RGB source images
of 1300×900 pixels. Both datasets are available from Duke
University, and the manual annotations of the topological

trees were generated by a sketching software [7].

4.2. Results on NeurB1 and NeurB2 datasets

Figure 3 presents for visual comparison the topology
reconstruction results of the competing methods on two
example images from the NeurB1 and NeurB2 neuronal
dataset: a commercially available neurite tracer module
of Metamorph NX (MMNX)3; and two label propagation
methods for tree-structure topology estimation: Loopy Be-
lief Propagation (LBP) [22], and Matrix Forest Theorem of
Directed (MFTD) [11]. Pink discs indicate incorrectly iden-
tiﬁed junctions, and gray square demonstrate correctly iden-
tiﬁed junctions of neuronal images. Compared with their
gold standards, it is clear from visual inspection that the
proposed method made consistently far fewer mistakes.

To facilitate better observation and objective evaluation
of the performance of the proposed method in the topology
reconstruction of tree-like structures, we calculate the accu-
racy of the identiﬁed junctions and their associated curvilin-
ear centerline pixels of the tree-like structure as follows. Let
A be the total number of the junctions or centerline pixels
of a tree-like structure, and B be the number of the junc-
tions or centerline pixels that have been correctly identiﬁed
(the vertices of the estimated topology tree have been as-
signed labels identical with groundtruth). The accuracy is
then computed by Acc = B
A × 100%, and here we refer to
AccI and AccII as the accuracy at junction level, and cen-
terline pixel level, respectively. In addition, the DIADEM
score [17] is utilized to measure the similarity between a
groundtruth tree-like structure and the corresponding topol-
ogy estimation result. The DIADEM score is a widely-used
metric to measure the similarity of two neuronal structures,
and the obtained score falls in the range [0, 1], where 0 indi-
cates a completely mismatch and 1 indicates perfect agree-
ment. The x-y threshold of the DIADEM score is set as 30
pixels in this experiment.

Table 1 presents the performance measurements of the
proposed method and competing methods in identifying
connectivity at junctions. It may be observed that the pro-
posed method is able to detect the most of the junctions cor-
rectly, with AccI = 90.0%, AccII = 93.6%, and DIADEM
score = 0.67 in the NeurB1 dataset. Overall, our approach
consistently outperforms the commercial software and the
other topology estimation methods by a rather large margin
with respect to crossover issues. (Note: we quote the visual
and numerical results reported in [11] in the belief that their
results were the best achievable.)

4.3. Results on the WIDE and RICE datasets

Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the topology reconstruction re-
sults on the WIDE and RICE datasets. Again, we ﬁrst mea-
sure the performance of the proposed method in identifying
connectivity in the WIDE and RICE datasets, as shown in
Table 2, by counting the number of correctly identiﬁed junc-
tions. As expected, the accuracy of the topology reconstruc-
tion at vessel centerline level (i.e. AccII = 93.6% in WIDE
dataset) is lower than the result obtained at junction level
(AccI = 96.6%). This is because the number of curvilinear
segments is much larger than the number of junctions.

In order to provide an objective evaluation, we have com-
pared the proposed method with a Heuristic Search Algo-
rithm (HSA) [14] that efﬁciently explores the space of pos-
sible trees starting from the Greedy Linear-time Algorithm
(GLA) [14], and these are the only two methods in the lit-
erature that have reported topology reconstruction perfor-
mances on these two datasets. For the sake of fair compari-
son, four weighted scores were obtained to measure the sim-
ilarity between each reconstructed tree and the ground-truth
tree: parent similarity (sp), ﬂow similarity (sf), absolute sim-
ilarity (sa), and relative similarity (sr). The ﬁrst two demon-
strate local performance in connectivity, while the latter two
capture more global differences. For more detail, we refer
the reader to [14].

Table 3 reports the comparison of our method with
the state-of-the-art topology reconstruction methods on the
WIDE and RICE datasets. For the WIDE dataset, the inter-
observer scores were reported in [14]. It can be seen that
the similarity scores of the proposed method are very close
to those of the human observer. All three methods - the
proposed method and its two competitors - achieve superior
performances on the RICE dataset. That is because the roots
of rice plants have fewer branches than the other datasets,
and these root structures have a tendency to grow down-
wards through the ground (right direction of Figure 5), giv-

ing a radially symmetrical appearance. In consequence, the
less variable images tend to lead to more accurate results in
the topology estimation task.

5. Conclusions

The topology reconstruction from a single 2-D image
of a 3-D tree-structure is challenging, since the full spa-
tial location of each tree branch is lost after projection. In
this paper, we have proposed a novel topology estimation
method for tree-like structures, formulated as a pairwise
clustering problem. First, a novel curvilinear structure sim-
ilarity measurement is proposed, then it is utilized to guide
the dominant-set clustering approach to identify the connec-
tivity at the junctions, before ﬁnally achieving an accurate
topology estimation of the tree network.

It is worth noting that by using this method the number
of points processed in the course of identifying a dominant
set is greatly reduced, from the number of pixels in an image
to the number of junctions in a tree network. This leads to
an increase of time-efﬁciency in topology estimation. The

competitiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the fact
that it accurately reconstructed tree topologies from four
publicly accessible biomedical image datasets with differ-
ent imaging modalities. The results demonstrated that our
method achieves superior performances when compared di-
rectly with the existing state-of-the-art ones. It is believed
that the proposed method could be a powerful tool for ana-
lyzing tree-like structures in the biomedical images.
