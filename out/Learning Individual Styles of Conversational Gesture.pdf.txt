Abstract

Human speech is often accompanied by hand and arm
gestures. We present a method for cross-modal translation
from “in-the-wild” monologue speech of a single speaker
to their conversational gesture motion. We train on unla-
beled videos for which we only have noisy pseudo ground
truth from an automatic pose detection system. Our pro-
posed model signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline methods in
a quantitative comparison. To support research toward
obtaining a computational understanding of the relation-
ship between gesture and speech, we release a large video
dataset of person-speciﬁc gestures.

1. Introduction

When we talk, we convey ideas via two parallel channels
of communication — speech and gesture. These conversa-
tional, or co-speech, gestures are the hand and arm motions
we spontaneously emit when we speak [30]. They comple-
ment speech and add non-verbal information that help our

listeners comprehend what we say [6]. Kendon [22] places
conversational gestures at one end of a continuum, with sign
language, a true language, at the other end. In between the
two extremes are pantomime and emblems like “Italianite”,
with an agreed-upon vocabulary and culture-speciﬁc mean-
ings. A gesture can be subdivided into phases describing
its progression from the speaker’s rest position, through the
gesture preparation, stroke, hold and retraction back to rest.

Is the information conveyed in speech and gesture corre-
lated? This is a topic of ongoing debate. The hand-in-hand
hypothesis claims that gesture is redundant to speech when
speakers refer to subjects and objects in scenes [38].
In
contrast, according to the trade-off hypothesis, speech and
gesture are complementary since people use gesture when
speaking would require more effort and vice versa [15]. We
approach the question from a data-driven learning perspec-
tive and ask to what extent can we predict gesture motion
from the raw audio signal of speech.

We present a method for temporal cross-modal transla-
tion. Given an input audio clip of a spoken statement (Fig-
ure 1 bottom), we generate a corresponding motion of the
speaker’s arms and hands which matches the style of the

Figure 2: Speaker-speciﬁc gesture dataset. We show a representative video frame for each speaker in our dataset. Below each one is a
heatmap depicting the frequency that their arms and hands appear in different spatial locations (using the skeletal representation of gestures
shown in Figure 1. This visualization reveals the speaker’s resting pose, and how they tend to move—for example, Angelica often keeps
her hands folded, whereas Alamaram puts them at his sides and frequently lifts them. Note that some speakers, like Kagan, Conan and
Ellen, alternate between sitting and standing and thus the distribution of their arm positions is bimodal.

speaker, despite the fact that we have never seen or heard
this person say this utterance in training (Figure 1 middle).
We then use an existing video synthesis method to visualize
what the speaker might have looked like when saying these
words (Figure 1 top).

To generate motion from speech, we must learn a map-
ping between audio and pose. While this can be formu-
lated as translation, in practice there are two inherent chal-
lenges to using the natural pairing of audio-visual data in
this setting. First, gesture and speech are asynchronous, as
gesture can appear before, after or during the correspond-
ing utterance [4]. Second, this is a multimodal prediction
task as speakers may perform different gestures while say-
ing the same thing at different occasions. Moreover, ac-
quiring human annotations for large amounts of video is in-
feasible. We therefore need to get a training signal from
pseudo ground truth of 2D human pose detections on unla-
beled video.

Nevertheless, we are able to translate speech to gesture
in an end-to-end fashion from the raw audio to a sequence
of poses. To overcome the asynchronicity issue we use a
large temporal context (both past and future) for prediction.
Temporal context also allows for smooth gesture prediction
despite the noisy automatically-annotated pseudo ground
truth. Due to multimodality, we do not expect our predicted

motion to be the same as the ground truth. However, as this
is the only training signal we have, we still use automatic
pose detections for learning through regression. To avoid
regressing to the mean of all modes, we apply an adversar-
ial discriminator [18] to our predicted motion. This ensures
that we produce motion that is “real” with respect to the
current speaker.

Gesture is idiosyncratic [30], as different speakers tend
to use different styles of motion (see Figure 2). It is there-
fore important to learn a personalized gesture model for
each speaker. To address this, we present a large, 144-hour
person-speciﬁc video dataset of 10 speakers that we make
publicly available1. We deliberately pick a set of speakers
for which we can ﬁnd hours of clean single-speaker footage.
Our speakers come from a diverse set of backgrounds: tele-
vision show hosts, university lecturers and televangelists.
They span at least three religions and discuss a large range
of topics from commentary on current affairs through the
philosophy of death, chemistry and the history of rock mu-
sic, to readings in the Bible and the Qur’an.

2. Related Work

Conversational Gestures McNeill [30] divides gestures
into several classes [30]: emblematics have speciﬁc conven-
tional meanings (e.g. “thumbs up!”). iconics convey physi-
cal shapes or direction of movements. metaphorics describe
abstract content using concrete motion. deictics are point-
ing gestures, and beats are repetitive fast hand motions that
provide a temporal framing to speech.

Many psychologists have studied questions related to co-
speech gestures [30, 22] (See [41] for a review). This vast
body of research has mostly relied on studying a small num-
ber of individual subjects using recorded choreographed
story retelling in lab settings. Analysis in these studies was
a manual process. Our goal, instead, is to study conversa-
tional gestures in the wild using a data-driven approach.

Conditioning gesture prediction on speech is arguably an
ambiguous task, since gesture and speech may not be syn-
chronous. While McNeill [30] suggests that gesture and
speech originate from a common source and thus should co-
occur in time according to well-deﬁned rules, Kendon [22]
suggests that gesture starts before the corresponding utter-
ance. Others even argue that the temporal relationships be-
tween speech and gesture are not yet clear and that gesture
can appear before, after or during an utterance [4].

Sign language and emblematic gesture recognition
There has been a great deal of computer vision work that
deals with recognizing sign language gestures from video.
This includes methods that use video transcripts as a weak
source of supervision [3], as well as recent methods based
on CNNs [33, 24] and RNNs [13]. There has also been work
that recognizes emblematic hand and face gestures [16, 14],
head gestures [31], and co-speech gestures [34]. By con-
trast, our goal is to predict co-speech gestures from audio.

Conversational agents Researchers have proposed a
number of methods for generating plausible gestures, par-
ticularly for applications with conversational agents [8]. In
early work, Cassell et al. [7] proposed a system that guided
arm/hand motions based on manually deﬁned rules. Sub-
sequent rule-based systems [25] proposed new ways of ex-
pressing gestures via annotations.

More closely related to our approach are methods that
learn gestures from speech and text, without requiring an
author to hand-specify rules. Notably, [9] synthesized ges-
tures using natural language processing of spoken text, and
Neff [32] proposed a system for making person-speciﬁc
gestures. Levine et al. [28] learned to map acoustic prosody
features to motion using a HMM. Later work [27] extended
this approach to use reinforcement learning and speech
recognition, combined acoustic analysis with text [29], cre-
ated hybrid rule-based systems [36], and used restricted
Boltzmann machines for inference [11]. Since the goal of

these methods is to generate motions for virtual agents, they
use lab-recorded audio, text, and motion capture. This al-
lows them to use simplifying assumptions that present chal-
lenges for in-the-wild video analysis like ours: e.g., [28]
requires precise 3D pose and assumes that motions occur
on syllable boundaries, and [11] assumes that gestures are
initiated by an upward motion of the wrist.
In contrast
with these methods, our approach does not explicitly use
any text or language information during training—it learns
gestures from raw audio-visual correspondences—nor does
it use hand-deﬁned gesture categories: arm/hand pose are
predicted directly from audio.

Visualizing predicted gestures One of the most common
ways of visualizing gestures is to use them to animate a
3D avatar [40, 27, 19]. Since our work studies personal-
ized gestures for in-the-wild videos, where 3D data is not
available, we use a data-driven synthesis approach inspired
by Bregler et al. [2]. To do this, we use the pose-to-video
method of Chan et al. [10], which uses a conditional gen-
erative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize videos of
human bodies from pose.

Sound and vision Aytar et al. [1] use the synchronization
of visual and audio signals in natural phenomena to learn
sound representations from unlabeled in-the-wild videos by
transferring knowledge from trained discriminative models
in the visual domain.

Synchronization of audio and visual features can also be
used for synthesis. Langlois et al. [26] try to optimize for
such synchronous events by generating rigid-body anima-
tions of objects falling or tumbling that temporally match an
input sound wave of the desired sequence of contact events
with the ground plane. More recently, Shlizerman et al. [37]
animated the hands of a 3D avatar according to input mu-
sic. However, their focus was on music performance, rather
than gestures, and consequently the space of possible mo-
tions was limited (e.g., the zig-zag motion of a violin bow).
Moreover, while music is uniquely deﬁned by the motion
that generates it (and is synchronous with it), gestures are
neither unique to, nor synchronous with speech utterances.
Several works have focused on the speciﬁc task of syn-
thesizing videos of people speaking, given audio input.
Chung et al. [12] generate an image of a talking face from
a still image of the speaker and an input speech segment
by learning a joint embedding of the face and audio. Simi-
larly, [39] synthesizes videos of Obama saying novel words
by using recurrent neural network to map speech audio to
mouth shapes and then embedding the synthesized lips in
ground truth facial video. While both methods enable the
creation of fake content by generating faces saying words
taken from a different person, we focus on single-person
models that are optimized for animating same-speaker ut-
terances. Most importantly, generating gesture, rather than

3499

lip motion, from speech is more involved as gestures are
asynchronous with speech, multimodal and person-speciﬁc.

3. A Speaker-Speciﬁc Gesture Dataset

We introduce a large 144-hour video dataset speciﬁcally
tailored to studying speech and gesture of individual speak-
ers in a data-driven fashion. As shown in Figure 2, our
dataset contains in-the-wild videos of 10 gesturing speak-
ers that were originally recorded for television shows or
university lectures. We collect several hours of video per
speaker, so that we can individually model each one. We
chose speakers that cover a wide range of topics and ges-
turing styles. Our dataset contains: 5 talk show hosts, 3
lecturers and 2 televangelists. Details about data collection
and processing as well as an analysis of the individual styles
of gestures can be found in the supplementary material.

Gesture representation and annotation We represent
the speakers’ pose over time using a temporal stack of 2D
skeletal keypoints, which we obtain using OpenPose [5].
From the complete set of keypoints detected by OpenPose,
we use the 49 points corresponding to the neck, shoulders,
elbows, wrists and hands to represent gestures. Together
with the video footage, we provide the skeletal keypoints
for each frame of the data at a 15fps. Note, however, that
these are not ground truth annotations but a proxy for the
ground truth from a state-of-the-art pose detection system.

Quality of dataset annotations All ground truth,
whether from human observers or otherwise, has associated
error. The pseudo ground truth we collect using automatic
pose detection may have much larger error than human an-
notations, but it enables us to train on much larger amounts
of data. Still, we must estimate whether the accuracy of the
pseudo ground truth is good enough to support our quantita-
tive conclusions. We compare the automatic pose detections
to labels obtained from human observers on a subset of our
training data and ﬁnd that the pseudo ground truth is close
to human labels and that the error in the pseudo ground
truth is small enough for our task. The full experiment is
detailed in our supplementary material.

4. Method

Given raw audio of speech, our goal is to generate the
speaker’s corresponding arm and hand gesture motion. We
approach this task in two stages — ﬁrst, since the only sig-
nal we have for training are corresponding audio and pose
detection sequences, we learn a mapping from speech to
gesture using L1 regression to temporal stacks of 2D key-
points. Second, to avoid regressing to the mean of all pos-
sible modes of gesture, we employ an adversarial discrim-
inator that ensures that the motion we produce is plausible
with respect to the typical motion of the speaker.

Figure 3: Speech to gesture translation model. A convolutional
audio encoder downsamples the 2D spectrogram and transforms
it to a 1D signal. The translation model, G, then predicts a corre-
sponding temporal stack of 2D poses. L1 regression to the ground
truth poses provides a training signal, while an adversarial dis-
criminator, D, ensures that the predicted motion is both temporally
coherent and in the style of the speaker.

4.1. Speech to Gesture Translation

Any realistic gesture motion must be temporally coher-
ent and smooth. We accomplish smoothness by learning an
audio encoding which is a representation of the whole ut-
terance, taking into account the full temporal extent of the
input speech s, and predicting the whole temporal sequence
of corresponding poses p at once (rather than recurrently).
Our fully convolutional network consists of an audio en-
coder followed by a 1D UNet [35, 21] translation architec-
ture, as shown in Figure 3. The audio encoder takes a 2D
log-mel spectrogram as input, and downsamples it through
a series of convolutions, resulting in a 1D signal with the
same sampling rate as our video (15 Hz). The UNet transla-
tion architecture then learns to map this signal to a temporal
stack of pose vectors (see Section 3 for details of our gesture
representation) via an L1 regression loss:

LL1 (G) = E

s,p[||p − G(s)||1]

(1)

We use a UNet architecture for translation since its bot-
tleneck provides the network with past and future tempo-
ral context, while the skip connections allow for high fre-
quency temporal information to ﬂow through, enabling pre-
diction of fast motion.

4.2. Predicting Plausible Motion

While L1 regression to keypoints is the only way we
can extract a training signal from our data, it suffers from
the known issue of regression to the mean which produces
overly smooth motion as can be seen in our supplementary
video results. To combat this and ensure that we produce re-
alistic motion, we add an adversarial discriminator [21, 10]
D, conditioned on the differential of the predicted sequence
of poses.
the input to the discriminator is the vector
m = [p2 − p1, . . . , pT − pT −1] where pi are 2D pose key-
points and T is the temporal extent of the input audio and
predicted pose sequence. The discriminator D tries to max-

i.e.

translation architecture, section 4.1) tries to minimize it.

LGAN (G, D) = E

m[log D(m)] + E

s[log(1 − G(s))] (2)

Where s is the input audio speech segment and m is the
motion derivative of the predicted stack of poses. Thus, the
generator learns to produce real-seeming speaker motion
while the discriminator learns to classify whether a given
motion sequence is real. Our full objective is therefore

4.3. Implementation Details

We obtain translation invariance by subtracting (per
frame) the neck keypoint location from all other keypoints
in our pseudo ground truth gesture representation (section
3). We then normalize each keypoint (e.g. left wrist) across
all frames by subtracting the per-speaker mean and divid-
ing by the standard deviation. During training, we take as
input spectrograms corresponding to about 4 seconds of au-
dio and predict 64 pose vectors, which correspond to about
4 seconds at a 15Hz frame-rate. At test time we can run
our network on arbitrary audio durations. We optimize us-
ing Adam [23] with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate
of 10−4. We train for 300K/90K iterations with and with-
out an adversarial loss, respectively, and select the best per-
forming model on the validation set.

5. Experiments

We show that our method produces motion that quanti-
tatively outperforms several baselines, as well as a previous
method that we adapt to the problem.

5.1. Setup

We describe our experimental setup including our base-

lines for comparison and evaluation metric.

5.1.1 Baselines

We compare our method to several other models.
Always predict the median pose Speakers spend most of
their time in rest position [22], so predicting the speaker’s
median pose can be a high-quality baseline. For a visualiza-
tion of each speaker’s rest position, see Figure 2.
Predict a randomly chosen gesture
In this baseline, we
randomly select a different gesture sequence (which does
not correspond to the input utterance) from the training set
of the same speaker, and use this as our prediction. While
we would not expect this method to perform well quantita-
tively, there is reason to think it would generate qualitatively
appealing motion: these are real speaker gestures—the only
way to tell they are fake is to evaluate how well they corre-
sponds to the audio.

Nearest neighbors
Instead of selecting a completely ran-
dom gesture sequence from the same speaker, we can use
audio as a similarity cue. For an input audio track, we ﬁnd
its nearest neighbor for the speaker using pretrained audio
features, and transfer its corresponding motion. To repre-
sent the audio, we use the state-of-the-art VGGish feature
embedding [20] pretrained on AudioSet [17], and use co-
sine distance on normalized features.

RNN-based model [37] We further compare our motion
prediction to an RNN architecture proposed by Shlizerman
et al. Similar to us, Shlizerman et al. predict arm and hand
motion from audio in a 2D skeletal keypoint space. How-
ever, while our model is a convolutional neural network
with log-mel spectrogram input, theirs uses a 1-layer LSTM
model that takes MFCC features (a low-dimensional, hand-
crafted audio feature representation) as input. We evaluated
both feature types and found that for [37], MFCC features
outperform the log-mel spectrogram features on all speak-
ers. We therefore use their original MFCC features in our
experiments. For consistency with our own model, instead
of measuring L2 distance on PCA features, as they do, we
add an extra hidden layer and use L1 distance.

Ours, no GAN Finally, as an ablation, we compare our
full model to the prediction of the translation architecture
alone, without the adversarial discriminator.

5.1.2 Evaluation Metrics

Our main quantitative evaluation metric is the L1 regres-
sion loss of the different models in comparison. We ad-
ditionally report results according to the percent of correct
keypoints (PCK) [42], a widely accepted metric for pose de-
tection. Here, a predicted keypoint is deﬁned as correct if
it falls within α max(h, w) pixels of the ground truth key-
point, where h and w are the height and width of the person
bounding box, respectively. We take the PCK value with a
grain of salt, as it was not designed with gesture prediction
for partially visible speakers in mind. First, unlike L1, PCK
is not linear and correctness scores fall to zero outside a hard
threshold. Since our goal is not to predict the ground truth
motion but rather to use it as a training signal, L1 is more
suited to measuring how we perform on average. Second,
PCK is sensitive to large gesture motion as the correctness
radius depends on the width of the span of the speaker’s
arms. Third, the dependence on the person bounding box
introduces an artiﬁcial sensitivity to how much of the per-
son is shown in the frame and whether they are seated or
standing. While [42] suggest α = 0.1 for data with full
people and α = 0.2 for data where only half the person is
visible, we take an average over α = 0.1, 0.2 and show the
full results in the supplementary.

5.2. Quantitative Evaluation

We compare the results of our method to the baselines
using our quantitative metrics. To assess whether our re-
sults are perceptually convincing, we conduct a user study.
Finally, we ask whether the gestures we predict are person-
speciﬁc and whether the input speech is indeed a better pre-
dictor of motion than the initial pose of the gesture.

5.2.1 Numerical Comparison

We compare to all baselines on 2,048 randomly chosen test
set intervals per speaker and display the results in Table 1.
We see that on most speakers, our model outperforms all
others, where our no-GAN condition is slightly better than
the GAN one. This is expected, as the adversarial dis-
criminator pushes the generator to snap to a single mode
of the data, which is often further away from the actual
ground truth than the mean predicted by optimizing L1 loss
alone. Our model outperforms the RNN-based model on
most speakers. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that this baseline pre-
dicts relatively small motions on our data, which may be
due to the fact that it has relatively low capacity compared
to our UNet model.

5.2.2 Human Study

To gain insight into how synthesized gestures perceptually
compare to real motion, we conducted a small-scale real
vs.
fake perceptual study on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
We used one speaker, Oliver, who is always shot from the
same camera viewpoint and whose gestures are relatively
dynamic. We visualized gesture motion using videos of
skeletal wire frames. To provide participants with addi-
tional context, we included the ground truth mouth and fa-
cial keypoints of the speaker in the videos. We show exam-
ples of skeletal wire frame videos in our video supplemen-
tary material.

Participants watched a series of video pairs.

In each
pair, one video was produced from a real pose sequence;
the other was generated by an algorithm—our model or a
baseline. Participants were then asked to identify the video
containing the motion that corresponds to the speech sound
(we did not verify that they in fact listened to the speech
while answering the question). Videos of about 12 seconds
each of resolution 400×226 (downsampled from 910×512
in order to ﬁt two videos side-by-side on different screen
sizes) were shown, and after each pair, participants were
given unlimited time to respond. We sampled 100 input
audio intervals at random and predicted from them a 2D-
keypoint motion sequence using each method. Each task
consisted of 20 pairs of videos and was performed by 200
different participants. Each participant was given a short
training set of 10 video pairs before the start of the task,

Figure 4: Our trained models are person-speciﬁc. For every
speaker audio input (row) we apply all other individually trained
speaker models (columns). Color gradients correspond to L1 loss
values on a held out test set (lower is better). For each row, the en-
try on the diagonal is lightest as models work best using the input
speech of the person they were trained on.

and was given feedback indicating whether they had cor-
rectly identiﬁed the ground-truth motion.

We compared all the gesture-prediction models (Sec-
tion 5.1.1) and assessed the quality of each method using
the rate at which its output fooled the participants. Inter-
estingly, we found that all methods that generate realistic
motion fooled humans at similar rates. As shown in Ta-
ble 2, our results were comparable to real motion sequences,
whether selected by an audio-based nearest neighbor ap-
proach or randomly. While these baselines are signiﬁcantly
less accurate quantitatively (Table 1), they are perceptually
convincing because their components are realistic.

5.2.3 The Predicted Gestures are Person-Speciﬁc

For every speaker’s speech input (Figure 4 rows), we predict
gestures using all other speakers’ trained models (Figure 4
columns). We ﬁnd that on average, predicting using our
model trained on a different speaker performs better than
predicting random motion but signiﬁcantly worse than al-
ways predicting the median pose of the input speaker (and
far worse than the predictions from the model trained on
the input speaker). The diagonal structure of the confusion
matrix in Figure 4 exempliﬁes this.

5.2.4 Speech is a Good Predictor for Gesture

Seeing the success of our translation model, we ask how
much does the audio signal help when the initial pose of the
gesture sequence is known. In other words, how much can
sound tell us beyond what can be predicted from motion dy-
namics. To study this, we augment our model by providing
it the pose of the speaker directly preceding their speech,
which we incorporate into the bottleneck of the UNet (Fig-
ure 3). We consider the following conditions: Predict me-
dian pose, as in the baselines above. Predict the input initial

Table 2: Human study for the speech to gesture translation task on
12-second video clips of a single speaker. As a metric for com-
parison, we use the percentage of generated motion sequences that
participants labeled as real. We found that humans were not sensi-
tive to the alignment of speech and gesture. Gestures with realis-
tic motion—whether randomly selected from another video of the
same speaker or generated by our GAN-based model—fooled hu-
mans at equal rates (no statistically signiﬁcant difference between
the bolded numbers).

of the gesture sequence is a good predictor for the rest of the

pose input, where we condition the prediction on both the
speech and the initial pose.

Table 3 displays the results of the comparison for our
model trained without the adversarial discriminator (no
GAN). When comparing the Initial pose input and Speech
& initial pose input conditions, we ﬁnd that the addition
of speech signiﬁcantly improves accuracy when we average
the loss across all speakers (p < 10−3 using a two sided
t-test). Interestingly, we ﬁnd that most of the gains come
from a small number of speakers (e.g. Oliver) who make
large motions during speech.

5.3. Qualitative Results

We qualitatively compare our speech to gesture transla-
tion results to the baselines and the ground truth gesture
sequences in Figure 5. Please refer to our supplementary
video results which better convey temporal information.

6. Conclusion

Humans communicate through both sight and sound,
yet the connection between these modalities remains un-
clear [22]. In this paper, we proposed the task of predict-
ing person-speciﬁc gestures from “in-the-wild” speech as a
computational means of studying the connections between
these communication channels. We created a large person-
speciﬁc video dataset and used it to train a model for pre-
dicting gestures from speech. Our model outperforms other
methods in an experimental evaluation.

Despite its strong performance on these tasks, our model
has limitations that can be addressed by incorporating in-
sights from other work. For instance, using audio as input
has its beneﬁts as audio is a rich representation that con-
tains information about prosody, pitch, intonation, timbre,
rhythm, tone and more. However, audio does not directly
encode high-level language semantics that may allow us to
predict certain types of gesture (e.g. metaphorics), nor does
it separate the speaker’s speech from other sounds (e.g. au-
dience laughter). Second, We are treating pose estimations
as though they were ground truth, which introduces signiﬁ-
cant amount of noise—particularly on the speakers’ ﬁngers.

We see our work as a step toward a computational anal-

ysis of conversational gesture, and opening three possible
directions for further research. The ﬁrst is in using gestures
as a representation for video analysis: co-speech hand and
arm motion make a natural target for video prediction tasks.
The second is using in-the-wild gestures as a way of train-
ing conversational agents: we presented one way of visual-
izing gesture predictions, based on GANs [10], but, follow-
ing classic work [8], these predictions could also be used
to drive the motions of virtual agents. Finally, our method
is one of only a handful of initial attempts to predict mo-
tion from audio. This cross-modal translation task is fertile
ground for further research.
