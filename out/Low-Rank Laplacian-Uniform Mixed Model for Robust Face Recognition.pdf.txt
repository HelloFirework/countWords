Abstract

Sparse representation based methods have successfully
put forward a general framework for robust face recogni-
tion through linear reconstruction and sparsity constraints.
However, residual modeling in existing works is not yet ro-
bust enough when dealing with dense noise. In this paper,
we aim at recognizing identities from faces with varying
levels of noises of various forms such as occlusion, pixel
corruption, or disguise, and take improving the ﬁtting abil-
ity of the error model as the key to addressing this prob-
lem. To fully capture the characteristics of different noises,
we propose a mixed model combining robust sparsity con-
straint and low-rank constraint, which can deal with ran-
dom errors and structured errors simultaneously. For ran-
dom noises such as pixel corruption, we adopt a Laplacian-
uniform mixed function for ﬁtting the error distribution. For
structured errors like continuous occlusion or disguise, we
utilize robust nuclear norm to constrain the rank of the error
matrix. An effective iterative reweighted algorithm is then
developed to solve the proposed model. Comprehensive ex-
periments were conducted on several benchmark databases
for robust face recognition, and the overall results demon-
strate that our model is most robust against various kinds of
noises, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

1. Introduction

As one of the most important problems in computer vi-
sion, face recognition has claimed its importance in iden-
tity veriﬁcation and security surveillance. Numerous face
recognition methods have been proposed during the years.
At the early beginning, geometric information has been
used for face classiﬁcation [3]. Then robust appearance
features such as LBP [41, 1], SIFT [4], and Gabor fea-
tures [29, 39] have been put forward successively. The ge-
ometric features or appearance features of facial images are
concerned with the contents of the outer appearance, while
ignoring the intrinsic attributes of the face. Subspace analy-

sis [9, 18, 3] can effectively excavate the intrinsic character-
istics of an image by mapping the original image to a lower
dimension space. However, when the face image contains
occlusion or illumination changes, the subspace projection
methods can easily learn non-face feature components, es-
pecially when facing a small sample problem.

Deep learning has been applied widely in recent years
due to its convenience and learning ability [14, 21]. Com-
pared to early shallow back-propagation models, deeper
models, such as DeepID2+ [30], DeepFace [31], VGG-
Face [27], and FaceNet [28], demonstrate largely improved
performance on face recognition. Although these methods
have achieved great success in practical applications, exist-
ing deep neural networks often rely on a large number of
training samples, and are not robust to inputs with anoma-
lous distributions.

Sparse coding has achieved great performance in many
ﬁelds, such as feature extraction, signal processing, image
denoising and pattern recognition. Its core idea is to repre-
sent a test sample as a sparse linear combination of train-
ing samples, so that the smallest reconstruction error can
be achieved using only those training samples of the same
class as the test sample [35]. Usually, a test face image is
denoted by a column vector y in sparse representation. Let
D ∈ Rm×n be a dictionary composed of n samples, each
column of which is a training face sample. The general ob-
jective of sparse coding can be formulated as

x X
min

j

ρ(ej) + λkxk1

s.t. y − Dx = e

(1)

where ej denotes the j-th component in the residual e. The
objective is composed of two parts, i.e., the penalty for the
reconstruction errors and the sparsity constraint for the rep-
resentation.

Among numerous face recognition methods, sparse rep-
resentation based methods have achieved great robustness
against various types of noises. Most of these methods
focus on ﬁnding reasonable penalty for the reconstruction
residual. Many experimental results show that sparse repre-

sentation based methods have good robustness for dealing
with external interference, such as occlusion and illumina-
tion change [26, 19, 33]. By exploring the intrinsic charac-
teristics of the reconstruction errors, researchers have pro-
posed a number of more robust algorithms. Some focus on
the statistical analysis and others pay more attention to the
structural information.

However, the error image in more challenging situations
could be a complex integration that includes structured and
non-structured parts at the same time. In this paper, we aim
to provide a solution for face recognition with such compli-
cated errors, and a low-rank Laplacian-uniform mixed (LR-
LUM) model is proposed to tackle this problem. The main
contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. By inspecting the compositions and characteristics of
complex dense noises, we propose an LR-LUM model
which integrates both sparsity and low-rank constraints
for handling various types of noises simultaneously.

2. An iterative algorithm is developed to effectively ex-
cavate the discriminative ability and robustness of the
proposed model.

3. We evaluate the proposed joint model on several
representative face databases under various settings.
The overall experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves the best robustness under many com-
plex circumstances.

2. Related Work

Since sparse representation classiﬁcation (SRC) was
proposed and successfully applied to robust face recogni-
tion [35], many extended methods have emerged and made
their contributions. ESRC [7] extended SRC by construct-
ing an auxiliary dictionary to describe intra-class variations
and improve generalization. Deng et al. further developed
SLRC [8], which represents a test image as a superposition
of class centroids and intra-class differences. To improve
the robustness, He et al. [12] proposed maximum corren-
tropy criterion.
In the later work [13], they tried to inte-
grate the error detection and error correction mechanism in-
to a uniﬁed additive or multiplicative half-quadratic (HQ)
framework. Inspired by robust regression theory, Yang et
al. proposed robust sparse coding (RSC) [37], looking for
a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) solution for s-
parse representation. In a following work, they proposed
regularized robust coding (RRC) [40]. Assume that re-
construction errors ej and coding coefﬁcients xi are i.i.d
with probability density functions f (ej) and h(xi), respec-
tively. Let ρ(ej) = − ln f (ej) and π(ej) = − ln h(ej).
RRC employs local quadratic approximation to minimize
i=1 π(xi) (Dj is the j-th row in

j=1 ρ(yj − Dj x) + Pn

Pm

D) and leads to an iteratively reweighted least square solu-
tion, in which the weights are calculated by

wt

j = ρ′(yj − Dj xt)/(yj − Dj xt)

(2)

where ρ′ is the ﬁrst derivative of ρ. The minimization of
such an objective function ﬁnally becomes ℓ2- or ℓ1-norm
regularized problem, denoted as RRC-L2 or RRC-L1.

To address partial occlusion, Liao et al. [23] proposed
an alignment-free approach based on multi-task multi-
keypoint feature descriptor. In [25, 35], block-wise sparse
representation has been demonstrated to be robust for oc-
clusion. Jia et al. [19] attempted to recover the occluded
part by the statistical law discovered from the training set.

The above methods stretch a two-dimensional face im-
age into a vector, which obviously ignores the structured
information of error images in the spatial domain useful
for further improving the robustness. Therefore, some re-
searchers proposed to exploit the structured information of
error images to enhance the ability of models for error de-
scription, by using, e.g., Markov random ﬁelds and struc-
tured sparsity.
Inspired by structured sparsity theory, Jia
et al. [20] introduced structural information into SRC and
proposed the structured sparse representation classiﬁer (SS-
RC). Face images suffering from continuous occlusion or il-
lumination change would result in approximately low-rank
error images through sparse reconstruction, as Zhang et al.
revealed in [42]. Thus the rank function is used to restrain
the structured characteristic of error images, as follows,

min

x

rank(E) s.t. E = TM (y − Dx)

(3)

where TM (·) transforms a vector back into a 2D image. D-
ifferent from (1), the error image is represented as a matrix
here for rank computation. But rank minimization is an NP-
hard problem difﬁcult to be optimized directly. Nuclear-
norm based matrix regression (NMR) [38] was proposed
to approximate a rank function and achieved great perfor-
mance. The nuclear norm of an input matrix, denoted as
||·||∗, is equal to the sum of all singular values of the matrix.
Compared to other methods relying on the structured infor-
mation of error images, NMR is more concise and effective,
which has attracted much attention in recent years. Howev-
er, nuclear norm is sensitive to large singular values, which
may increase the instability for face classiﬁcation. Xie et
al. [36] proposed a robust NMR, which takes a weighted
form to enhance the approximation ability and guarantee an
optimal solution. The robust NMR can be formulated as

min

x

kTM (y − Dx)kw,∗ = X

i

ρ(di) · di

(4)

where di is the i-th largest singular value of E = TM (y −
Dx). A weight function ρ(d) = d−κ is employed with a
regulating factor κ ≥ 0. When κ = 0, ||E||w,∗ is equal to
the regular nuclear-norm constraint ||E||∗.

3. Our Proposed Method

3.1. Low Rank Laplacian Uniform Mixed Model

For robust face recognition, we aim to develop a method
capable of recognizing the identity of a face image contam-
inated by dense noises as shown in Fig. 1. Although dense
noises in real scenarios could be complex combinations in-
duced by different sources, they can be generally catego-
rized into two types according to the characteristics, i.e.,
unpredictable random noises such as random pixel corrup-
tion and structured noises such as continuous occlusion. To
handle errors induced by these two types of noises simulta-
neously, we construct an objective function as follows,

J(x) = αC1(e1) + (1 − α)C2(e2) + βkxk1

s.t. y − Dx = e1 + e2

(5)

where C1(·) and C2(·) are penalty functions associated with
these two types of errors, respectively. For the structured er-
rors, e.g., that corresponding to the sunglasses in Fig. 1, we
can easily observe that the error matrix exhibits a low-rank
structure in comparison to the matrix size. We utilize the
robust nuclear norm proposed in [36] as a close relaxation
for the rank function, i.e., C1(·) is a robust nuclear norm
regularization term.

As for the random errors, the most signiﬁcant charac-
teristic that we can exploit is the statistical distribution.
Speciﬁcally, different assumptions about the error distribu-
tion may lead to different constraints on the random errors.
Assume that random errors e(i)
(i-th element in e2) are
2
i.i.d. with a probability density f (e(i)
2 ) =
− ln(f (e(i)

2 ), and let ρ(e(i)

2 )). The MLE for e2 would be

C2(e2) = X

i

ρ(cid:16)e(i)
2 (cid:17)

(6)

In order to better describe random errors in challenging sit-
uations, we adopt a Laplacian-uniform mixed (LUM) func-
tion for ﬁtting the error distribution, which can be expressed
as

f (e(i)

2 ) = α(cid:16)exp(−|e(i)

2 |/b) + c(cid:17)

(7)

where b > 0 corresponds to the scale of the Laplacian com-
ponent and c > 0 corresponds to a uniform distribution.
α > 0 is a distribution normalization factor.

The rationale behind this mixed distribution model
comes from a more in-depth analysis of the causes of re-
construction residuals. First, no matter how well a test face
can be reconstructed from the training set, there are bound
to be minor position shift, expression variations, and even
illumination changes between the original face and the re-
construction, which causes small coding residuals that take
place at random positions. Second, in worse conditions,
pixels at random positions might be corrupted to unpre-
dictable values with unknown characteristics. The LUM
model can appropriately ﬁt such situation, with a Laplacian
function addressing the ﬁrst case and a uniform distribution
addressing the latter case.

For a more intuitive demonstration, we computed the re-
construction residuals of an example face with 50% pixel
corruption. The empirical distribution curve of reconstruc-
tion residuals and other ﬁtted distribution curves are shown
in Fig. 2. The peak around zero comes from inaccurate re-
construction on face position, pose, expression, etc., as dis-
cussed above. A higher peak around zero is ﬁtted by the
LUM function for inclining to inlier pixels with small resid-
uals. And the long tail is caused by randomly corrupted out-
liers. We can see that the LUM function is able to describe
both characteristics well.

In order to optimize the C2(e2) term with the LUM prior,

After understanding the motivation of choosing the cor-
responding penalties for the two types of errors, we con-
struct the ﬁnal objective function as follows,

We can decompose the optimization problem into several
subproblems as follows, and solve the subproblems and up-
date the corresponding variables alternately.

min

x

αkTM (e1)kw,∗ + (1 − α)kW e2k1 + βkxk1

s.t. y − Dx = e1 + e2

(11)

where 0 < α < 1 is a weight for balancing the reweighted
ℓ1-norm penalty and the low-rank penalty corresponding to
the two types of residuals. β is the weight of the sparsity
penalty of coding coefﬁcients.

The proposed model is denoted as low-rank Laplacian-
uniform mixed model (LR-LUM). It is different from pre-
vious mixed models proposed in [36, 17]. Iliadis et al. pro-
posed an objective function that utilized both sparsity and
low-rank constraints for error penalties [17]. However, their
model was designed against errors caused by occlusion, and
they assigned both constraints to the same type of errors in
their model. Moreover, they ﬁtted the errors to a distribu-
tion based on a tailored loss function, rather than the LUM
function adopted in our model. Nuclear norm was used for
low-rank constraint rather than the robust (weighted) nucle-
ar norm. In [36], ℓ1-norm was utilized to penalize random
errors. However, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 and argued in
the above, the Laplacian distribution does not ﬁt the ran-
dom errors as well as the LUM function in practice.

To solve the above optimization problem, we ﬁrst make an
equivalent transformation by introducing an auxiliary vari-
able d, to make this complex problem able to be decom-
posed into several easier subproblems. Let ˜e2 = W e2.
Then (12) can be rewritten as

min

αkTM (d)kw,∗ + (1 − α)k˜e2k1 + βkxk1

s.t. W (y − Dx − e1) = ˜e2, d = e1

(13)

As a constrained optimization problem, (13) can be
solved iteratively through the ADMM method [5]. Then
the augmented Lagrangian function is deﬁned as

Lµ(e1, ˜e2, x, d, z1, z2) =
αkTM (d)kw,∗ + (1 − α)k˜e2k1 + βkxk1

are only those of x∗ corresponding to the i-th class.

This problem can be solved by singular value thresholding
(SVT) as in [36]. Let G = TM (g5), and G = U ΣV T be
the SVD of G, where Σ is a semi-positive diagonal matrix.
The optimal solution for d can be obtained as follows,

to 96 × 84 and 42 × 30 pixels, respectively, to verify the per-
formance of the proposed method in dealing with face im-
ages of different resolutions. EYB is divided into 5 subsets
according to different illumination conditions. AR contains
Session 1 and Session 2, which are collected on different
dates. Faces from LFW are detected using the Viola-Jones
face detector [32], and then cropped and aligned as in [11]
and resized to 90 × 90 pixels.

The parameters b and c in (10) should ﬁt the actual dis-
tribution of coding residuals. They are estimated in each
iteration using the mean em of the absolute value of cod-
ing residuals. Speciﬁcally, b and c are set to et
m/k and
c0 exp (−et
m/b), respectively. k = 10 and c0 = 50 in
all experiments, except for testing on clean LFW images,
for which we set k = 2 and c0 = 0.01 to incline to small
residuals caused by inaccurate alignment. To balance the
penalties, we set α = 0.25 and β = 0.2 in the objective
function (11). µ in (14) is set to 2m/kyk1 as in [37]. The
maximum iteration number of the outer loop in Algorithm 1
is set to 25. We set the maximum iteration number of the
inner loop to 8 in the ﬁrst 20 iterations of the outer loop for
higher efﬁciency, and to 200 in the last 5 iterations of the
outer loop to guarantee convergence.

Comparison is carried out between the proposed mod-
el and a number of state-of-the-art and competitive robust
methods, including CESR [12], S-SRC [35], R-SRC [35],
RRC-L1 [40], RRC-L2 [40], HQ-M [13], HQ-A [13], F-
IRNNLS [17], and F-LR-IRNNLS [17].

Now that we have the solutions for all the subproblems.
We only need to update the variables alternately and itera-
tively until convergence (relevant variables only show neg-
ligible changes). The weight matrix W for random errors is
ﬁxed during the above iteration, and updated using (10) in
an outer loop. The overall algorithm can be summarized as
in Algorithm 1.

4. Experiments

4.1. Databases & Parameter Settings

To verify the effectiveness of the LR-LUM model and
Algorithm 1, we conduct extensive experiments on several
face recognition benchmark databases, including Extend-
ed Yale-B (EYB) [10, 22], AR [24], and Labeled Face in
the Wild (LFW) [15, 16]. Face images in EYB and AR
are all collected in restricted condition with frontal view,
while faces in LFW are captured in uncontrolled environ-
ments. Images from the EYB and AR databases are resized

Two types of evaluation settings are adopted on EYB,
which are denoted as “single training sample” and “mul-
ti training samples” protocols, respectively. For the single
training sample setting, we choose the ﬁrst sample of each
subject in Subset 1 for training, and all images in Subset 3
(more extreme lighting conditions) for testing. In the case
of multi training samples, we use all images from Subset
1 and Subset 2 for training, and Subset 3 for testing, as
in [35], [40], and [17].

4.2.1 Face recognition on clean images

The basic recognition performances of all methods on clean
images of EYB, i.e., images without further occlusion or
corruption, are shown in Fig. 3. For multi training samples,
there are 17-19 training samples for each subject. Most of
the compared methods achieved pretty good performances
under this setting. However, when only one training sample
is available, the performances of all compared methods de-
grade signiﬁcantly, while the proposed method still demon-
strates an accuracy of 87.2%, which outperforms the other
methods by over 27%.

4.2.2 Robust face recognition under various noises

We evaluate the robustness of the proposed method against
various noises, including pixel corruption, block occlusion,
and their mixture. The test set is further subject to different
illumination conditions, which can be considered as anoth-
er type of noise. Examples of face images under different
noises are shown in Fig. 4.

sion. (d) With 20% occlusion and 20% pixel corruption.

We evaluate all methods under 10 to 60 percent of three
types of noises, i.e., pixel corruption, block occlusion, and
their mixture. For example, 10% pixel corruption is intro-
duced by setting 10% pixels at random locations of the face
image to random values, and 10% occlusion is added by re-
placing a square block (10% size of the image) at a random
position with a commonly used baboon image. 10% mixed
noises means 10% occlusion plus 10% pixel corruption.

As shown in Fig. 5, our method demonstrates the best
overall performance.
In particular, with a single training
sample, the proposed model signiﬁcantly outperforms the
other methods, which means that our method can be applied
in difﬁcult scenarios when only few training samples are
available. For example, such an algorithm can potentially
provide useful information for law enforcement department
to identify faces captured in a crime scene, in which case
extreme illumination condition, occlusion, and corruption
often take place, and only limited gallery samples are avail-
able for veriﬁcation. As for the setting with multi training
samples, the proposed method achieves the best results a-
gainst pixel corruption and mixed noises, and the second
best against block occlusion. F-LR-IRNNLS [17] performs

slightly better against occlusion, owing to its stronger priori
assumption for contiguous occlusion. The proposed method
is signiﬁcantly more robust against various contamination-
s than F-LR-IRNNLS, when looking at the overall perfor-
mance.

Contaminations such as pixel corruption and block oc-
clusion introduced in the above experiments are artiﬁcially
synthesized, which may not be the case in real scenarios.
Noises occur in real scenes could be more complicated and
in more unpredictable forms. However, the above experi-
ments do provide us comprehensive evaluations of how the
proposed model performs against various types of individ-
ual or mixed noises. The evaluation of the robustness of
our method against noises in real scenarios will be further
demonstrated in the following sections.

4.3. Evaluation on the AR Database

We also adopt two evaluation protocols, i.e., the single
and multi training sample settings, to evaluate the proposed
method on the AR database. For each subject in each ses-
sion of the AR database, there are three face images with
sunglass disguise and three with scarf, where several exam-

50 female subjects for the experiments. For the single train-
ing sample setting, we conduct experiments on each session
separately. The only natural clean face image of each sub-
ject in each session is used for training. The three samples
with sunglasses and the other three with scarf are used for
testing, respectively. As for the multi training sample set-
ting, we use the two natural clean face images from both
sessions for training, and six samples with sunglasses and
six with scarf from both sessions for testing.

4.3.1 Evaluation under real disguise

The comparison of recognition accuracies under real dis-
guise is shown in Fig. 7. The proposed method outperform-
s all the other methods under both single and multi train-
ing sample settings, against sunglass or scarf disguise. Un-
der the single training sample setting, our method achieves
88% accuracy in Session 1 and 92% in Session 2 against
sunglass occlusion, and 68.2% in Session 1 and 66.8% in
Session 2 against scarf occlusion, which are over 3%, 5%,
10%, and 7% improvements, respectively, compared to all
other methods. Under the multi training sample setting, our
method achieves the highest accuracies of 92.5% against
sunglasses and 66.9% against scarf, which are over 4% and
5% improvements compared to all other methods.

4.3.2 Recognition under mixed noises

To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mod-
el under more extreme circumstances, we conduct experi-
ments on the AR database with mixed noises of real dis-
guise and pixel corruption. The test samples are further sub-
ject to 10 to 60 percent pixel corruption. The performance
comparison is shown in Fig. 8.

From Fig. 8, we can observe that the proposed model
outperforms other compared methods in all experiments,
which indicates that our method can handle various type-
s of noises and manages to maintain good and stable per-
formance in complex circumstances. The experimental re-
sults verify that the proposed model successfully captures
the characteristics of both non-structured random noise and
structured occlusion, by using the Laplacian-uniform mixed

distribution to model random errors and robust nuclear nor-
m to constrain structured errors.

4.4. Evaluation on the LFW Database

In order to verify the robustness of our method against
uncontrolled conditions in practice, we carry out further
experiments on the LFW database. Face images in LFW
contain many unpredictable variations, such as illumination
changes, head pose variations, etc., which pose serious chal-
lenges for recognition. We selected 100 experimental sub-
jects, each of which contains no less than 14 face images.
For each subject, 7 face images were randomly selected for
training, and the other 7 for testing. Finally, there are 700
face images in each of the training and testing sets.

We evaluate all methods on the clean test images as well
as those with 20% and 40% mixed noises of block occlu-
sion and pixel corruption. As shown in Table 1, the pro-
posed method demonstrates the best robustness among all
compared methods. When the test samples are contami-
nated by 40% block occlusion and 40% pixel corruption,
our method still achieves a recognition accuracy of 60.8%,
which is over 15% higher than the second best. Note that
the overall noises are very complicated and challenging by
combining the mixed noises that we intentionally added to
the test samples with the intrinsic noises that the dataset o-
riginally contains. The experimental results demonstrate the
strong robustness of our method.

5. Discussion

One issue to be noticed is that the recognition accura-
cy of our model on clean test samples in LFW might seem
unsatisfying, considering many deep learning approaches

could achieve accuracies of higher than 90%. However, this
could be an unfair comparison, since deep learning need-
s massive extra training data to achieve good performance.
Moreover, deep neural networks for regular face recogni-
tion achieve poor performance under contaminated condi-
tion. We have tested a pre-trained VGG-Face model [27] on
the LFW dataset constructed in Section 4.4, and its perfor-
mance drops to about 1% under 20% mixed noises.

Another reason why we did not consider experimental
comparison to deep learning methods in the above experi-
ments is, to the best of our knowledge, that there is lack of
comprehensive works using deep neural networks for face
recognition against dense noises. We noticed one speciﬁc
work [34], which employed a MaskNet trained to be bet-
ter activated on non-occluded facial regions to avoid errors
caused by contiguous occlusion. However, as mentioned
above, they used a large face dataset to pre-train their net-
work. Besides, occluded samples are used for ﬁne-tuning,
which actually assumes that the type and the form of noises
are known beforehand. Also, there is still lack of evalua-
tion to demonstrate its robustness under more challenging
situations, such as random corruption or mixed noises.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we attempt to better model errors caused
by complicated noises in robust face recognition, by intro-
ducing appropriate penalty terms. A low-rank Laplacian-
uniform mixed (LR-LUM) model is proposed, which mod-
els complex errors as a combination of two types of noises,
i.e., continuous structured noises and random noises. The
joint model integrates the LUM function to better ﬁt the
empirical distribution of random noises, and robust nuclear
norm to enforce the low-rank constraint on the structured
errors. An iteratively reweighted algorithm is developed to
effectively solve the proposed objective function. A series
of experiments have been designed to verify the discrimina-
tive ability and robustness of the proposed algorithm under
various challenging circumstances. Extensive experimental
comparison with many classical and state-of-the-art meth-
ods demonstrates the superiority of our method in terms of
robustness against various types of contaminations.
