Abstract

The computer vision community has witnessed recent ad-
vances in scene categorization from images, with the state
of the art systems now achieving impressive recognition
rates on challenging benchmarks. Such systems have been
trained on photographs which include color, texture and
shading cues. The geometry of shapes and surfaces, as con-
veyed by scene contours, is not explicitly considered for this
task. Remarkably, humans can accurately recognize natural
scenes from line drawings, which consist solely of contour-
based shape cues. Here we report the ﬁrst computer vi-
sion study on scene categorization of line drawings derived
from popular databases including an artist scene database,
MIT67 and Places365. Speciﬁcally, we use off-the-shelf
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to per-
form scene classiﬁcation given only contour information as
input, and ﬁnd performance levels well above chance. We
also show that medial-axis based contour salience methods
can be used to select more informative subsets of contour
pixels, and that the variation in CNN classiﬁcation perfor-
mance on various choices for these subsets is qualitatively
similar to that observed in human performance. Moreover,
when the salience measures are used to weight the con-
tours, we ﬁnd that these weights boost our CNN perfor-
mance above that for unweighted contour input. That is,
the medial axis based salience weights appear to add useful
information that is not available when CNNs are trained to
use contours alone.

1. Introduction

Both biological and artiﬁcial vision systems are con-
fronted with a potentially highly complex assortment of vi-

sual features in real-world scenarios. The features need
to be sorted and grouped appropriately in order to sup-
port high-level visual reasoning, including the recognition
or categorization of objects or entire scenes. In fact, scene
categorization cannot be easily disentangled from the recog-
nition of objects, since scene classes are often deﬁned by
a collection of objects in context. A beach scene, for ex-
ample, would typically contain umbrellas, beach chairs and
people in bathing suits, all of whom are situated next to a
body of water. A street scene might have roads with cars,
cyclists and pedestrians as well as buildings along the edge.
How might computer vision systems tackle this problem of
organizing visual features to support scene categorization?

In human vision, perceptual organization is thought to
be effected by a set of heuristic grouping rules originating
from Gestalt psychology [13]. Such rules posit that visual
elements ought to be grouped together if they are, for in-
stance, similar in appearance, in close proximity, or if they
are symmetric or parallel to each other. Developed on an
ad-hoc, heuristic basis originally, these rules have been val-
idated empirically, even though their precise neural mecha-
nisms remain elusive. Grouping cues, such as those based
on symmetry, are thought to aid in high-level visual tasks
such as object detection, because symmetric contours are
more likely to be caused by the projection of a symmetric
object than to occur accidentally. In the categorization of
complex real-world scenes by human observers, local con-
tour symmetry does indeed provide a perceptual advantage
[23], but the connection to the recognition of individual ob-
jects is not as straightforward as it may appear.

In computer vision, symmetry, proximity, good continu-
ation, contour closure and other cues have been used for im-
age segmentation, curve inference, object recognition, ob-
ject manipulation, and other tasks [14, 2, 7, 17]. Instantia-
tions of such organizational principles have found their way
into many computer vision algorithms and have been the
subject of regular workshops on perceptual organization in
artiﬁcial vision systems. However, perceptually motivated

salience measures to facilitate scene categorization have re-
ceived little attention thus far. This may be a result of the
ability of CNN-based systems to accomplish scene catego-
rization on challenging databases, in the presence of sufﬁ-
cient training data, directly from pixel intensity and colour
in photographs [18, 21, 11, 24]. CNNs begin by extracting
simple features, including oriented edges, which are then
successively combined into more and more complex fea-
tures in a succession of convolution, nonlinear activation
and pooling operations. The ﬁnal levels of CNNs are typ-
ically fully connected, which enables learning of object or
scene categories [20, 1, 8, 16]. Unfortunately, present CNN
architectures do not explicitly allow for properties of ob-
ject shape to be represented explicitly. Human observers,
in contrast, recognize an object’s shape as an inextricable
aspect of its properties, along with its category or identity
[12].

Comparisons between CNNs and human and monkey
neurophysiology appear to indicate that CNNs replicate the
entire visual hierarchy [9, 4]. Does this mean that the prob-
lem of perceptual organization is now irrelevant for com-
puter vision? In the present article we argue that this is
not the case. Rather, we show that CNN-based scene cat-
egorization systems, just like human observers, can beneﬁt

from explicitly computed contour measures derived from
Gestalt grouping cues. We here demonstrate the computa-
tion of these measures as well as their power to aid in the
categorization of complex real-world scenes.

To effect our study, with its focus on the geometry of
scene contours, we choose to use the medial axis transform
(MAT) as a representation. We apply a robust algorithm
for computing the medial axis to analyze line drawings of
scenes of increasing complexity. The algorithm uses the av-
erage outward ﬂux of the gradient of the Euclidean distance
function through shrinking circular disks [5]. With its ex-
plicit representation of the regions between scene contours,
the medial axis allows us to directly capture salience mea-
sures related to local contour separation and local contour
symmetry. We introduce two novel measures of local sym-
metry using ratios of length functions derived from the me-
dial axis radius along skeletal segments. As ratios of com-
mensurate quantities, these are unitless measures, which are
therefore invariant to image re-sizing. We also introduce
a measure of local contour separation. We describe meth-
ods of computing our perceptually motivated salience mea-
sures from line drawings of photographs of complex real-
world scenes, covering databases of increasing complexity.
Figure 1 presents an illustrative example of a photograph

from an artist scenes database, along with two of our me-
dial axis based contour salience maps. Observe how the
ribbon symmetry based measure highlights the boundaries
of highways. Our experiments show that scene contours
weighted by these measures can boost CNN-based scene
categorization accuracy, despite the absence of colour, tex-
ture and shading cues. Our work indicates that measures of
contour grouping, that are simply functions of the contours
themselves, are beneﬁcial for scene categorization by com-
puters, yet that they are not automatically extracted by state-
of-the-art CNN-based scene recognition systems. The crit-
ical remaining question is whether this omission is due to
the CNN architecture being unable to model these weights
or whether this has to do with the (relatively standard) train-
ing regime. We leave this for further study.

2. Average Outward Flux Based Medial Axes

In Blum’s grassﬁre analogy the medial axis is associated
with the quench points of a ﬁre that is lit at the boundary of
a ﬁeld of grass [3]. In the present paper, that boundary is the
set of scene contours, and the ﬁeld of grass is the space be-
tween them. An equivalent notion of the medial axis is that
of the locus of centres of maximal inscribed disks in the re-
gion between scene contours, along with the radii of these
disks. The geometry and methods for computing the medial
axis that we leverage are based on a notion of average out-
ward ﬂux, as discussed in further detail below. We apply the
same algorithm to each distinct connected region between
scene contours. These regions are obtained by morphologi-
cal operations to decompose the original line drawing.

Deﬁnition 2.1 Assume an n-dimensional open connected
region Ω, with its boundary given by ∂ Ω ∈ Rn such that
¯Ω = Ω ∪ ∂ Ω. An open disk D ∈ Rn is a maximal inscribed
disk in ¯Ω if D ⊆ ¯Ω but for any open disk D′ such that D ⊂ D′,
the relationship D′ ⊆ ¯Ω does not hold.

Deﬁnition 2.2 The Blum medial locus or skeleton, denoted
by Sk(Ω), is the locus of centers of all maximal inscribed
disks in ∂ Ω.

Topologically, Sk(Ω) consists of a set of branches, about
which the scene contours are locally mirror symmetric, that
join at branch points to form the complete skeleton. A
skeletal branch is a set of contiguous regular points from
the skeleton that lie between a pair of junction points, a pair
of end points or an end point and a junction point. At regu-
lar points the maximal inscribed disk touches the boundary
at two distinct points. As shown by Dimitrov et al.
[5]
medial axis points can be analyzed by considering the be-
havior of the average outward ﬂux (AOF) of the gradient
of the Euclidean distance function through the boundary of
the connected region. Let R be the region with boundary
∂ R, and let N be the outward normal at each point on the

R∂ R ds

boundary ∂ R. The AOF is given by the limiting value of
R∂ Rh ˙q,Nids
, as the region is shrunk. Here ˙q = ∇D, with D
the Euclidean distance function to the connected region’s
boundary, and the limiting behavior is shown to be different
for each of three cases: regular points, branch points and
end points. When the region considered is a shrinking disk,
at regular points of the medial axis the AOF works out to be
− 2
π sin θ , where θ is the object angle, the acute angle that a
vector from a skeletal point to the point where the inscribed
disk touches the boundary on either side of the medial axis
makes with the tangent to the medial axis. This quantity is
negative because it is the inward ﬂux that is positive. Fur-
thermore, the limiting AOF value for all points not located
on the medial axis is zero.

This provides a foundation for both computing the me-
dial axis for scene contours and for mapping the computed
medial axis back to them. First, given the Euclidean dis-
tance function from scene contours, one computes the lim-
iting value of the AOF through a disk of shrinking radius
and associates locations where this value is non-zero with
medial axis points (Figure 1, top right). Then, given the
AOF value at a regular medial axis point, and an estimate
of the tangent to the medial axis at it, one rotates the tan-
gent by ±θ and then extends a vector out on either side
by an amount given by the radius function, to reconstruct
the boundary (Figure 1, bottom left). In our implementa-
tions we discretize these computations on a ﬁne grid, along
with a dense sampling of the boundary of the shrinking disk,
to get high quality scene contour representations. Both the
Euclidean distance function and the average outward ﬂux
computation are linear in the number of contour pixels, and
thus can be implemented efﬁciently.

3. Medial Axis Based Contour Saliency

Owing to the continuous mapping between the medial
axis and scene contours, the medial axis provides a con-
venient representation for designing and computing Gestalt
contour salience measures based on local contour separa-
tion and local symmetry. A measure to reﬂect local con-
tour separation can be designed using the radius function
along the medial axis, since this gives the distance to the
two nearest scene contours on either side. Local parallelism
between scene contours, or ribbon symmetry, can also be
directly captured by examining the degree to which the ra-
dius function along the medial axis between them remains
locally constant. Finally, if taper is to be allowed between
contours, as in the case of a set of railway tracks extend-
ing to the horizon under perspective projection, one can ex-
amine the degree to which the ﬁrst derivative of the radius
function is constant along a skeletal segment. We introduce
novel measures to capture local separation, ribbon symme-
try and taper, based on these ideas.

In the following we shall let p be a parameter that runs
along a medial axis segment, C(p) = (x(p), y(p)) be the
coordinates of points along that segment, and R(p) be the
medial axis radius at each point. We shall consider the in-
terval p ∈ [α, β ] for a particular medial segment. The arc
length of that segment is given by

L = Z β

3.1. Separation Salience

We now introduce a salience measure based on the local
separation between two scene contours associated with the
same medial axis segment. Consider the interval p ∈ [α, β ].
With R(p) > 1 in pixel units (because two scene contours
cannot touch) we introduce the following contour separa-
tion based salience measure:

SSeparation = 1 −(cid:16)Z β

R(p)

d p(cid:17)/(β − α).

This quantity falls in the interval [0, 1]. The measure in-
creases with increasing spatial separation between the two
contours. In other words, scene contours that exhibit further
(local) separation are more salient by this measure.

3.2. Ribbon Symmetry Salience

Now consider the curve Ψ = (x(p), y(p), R(p)). Similar

to Equation 1, the arc length of Ψ is computed as:

Ψ′ = (x(p), y(p), dR(p)
lowing taper symmetry salience measure:

d p ). Speciﬁcally, we introduce the fol-

The bottom integral is not exactly an arc-length, due to the
multiplication of Rpp by the factor R. This modiﬁcation
is necessary to make the overall ratio unitless. This quan-
tity also falls in the interval [0, 1] and is invariant to image
scaling. The measure is designed to increase as the scene
contours on either side become more taper symmetric, as in
the shape of a funnel, or the sides of a railway track.

When two scene contours are close to being parallel locally,

This quantity also falls in the interval [0, 1] and is invariant
to image scaling since the integral involves a ratio of unit-
less quantities. The measure is designed to increase as the
scene contours on either side become more parallel, such as
the two sides of a ribbon.

3.3. Taper Symmetry Salience

A notion that is closely related to that of ribbon symme-
try is taper symmetry; two scene contours are taper symmet-
ric when the medial axis between them has a radius func-
tion that is changing at a constant rate, such as the edges
of two parallel contours in 3D when viewed in perspective.
To capture this notion of symmetry, we introduce a slight
variation where we consider a type of arc-length of a curve

Figure 2: An illustration of ribbon symmetry salience, taper
symmetry salience and contour separation salience for three
different contour conﬁgurations. See text for a discussion.
These measures are all invariant to 2D similarity transforms
of the input contours

To gain an intuition behind these perceptually driven
contour salience measures, we provide three illustrative ex-
amples in Fig. 2. The measures are not computed point-
wise, but rather for a small interval [α, β ] centered at each
medial axis point (see Section 4.3 for details). When the
contours are parallel, all three measures are constant along
the medial axis (left column). The middle ﬁgure has high
taper symmetry but lower ribbon symmetry, with contour
separation salience increasing from left to right. Finally, for
the dumbbell shape, all three measures vary (third column).

4. Experiments & Results

4.1. Artist Generated Line Drawings

Artist Scenes Database: Color photographs of six cate-
gories of natural scenes (beaches, city streets, forests, high-
ways, mountains, and ofﬁces) were downloaded from the
internet, and those rated as the best exemplars of their
respective categories by workers on Amazon Mechanical
Turk were selected. Line drawings of these photographs
were generated by trained artists at the Lotus Hill Research
Institute [22]. Artists traced the most important and salient
lines in the photographs on a graphics tablet using a custom
graphical user interface. Contours were saved as succes-
sions of anchor points. For the experiments in the present
paper, line drawings were rendered by connecting anchor
points with straight black lines on a white background at
a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels. The resulting database
had 475 line drawings in total with 79-80 exemplars from
each of 6 categories: beaches, mountains, forests, highway
scenes, city scenes and ofﬁce scenes.

4.2. Machine Generated Line Drawings

MIT67/Places365 Given the limited number of scene
categories in the Artist Scenes database, particularly for
computer vision studies, we worked to extend our results
to the two popular but much larger scene databases of pho-
tographs - MIT67 [15] (6700 images, 67 categories) and
Places365 [24] (1.8 million images, 365 categories). Pro-
ducing artist generated line drawings on databases of this
size was not feasible, so instead we ﬁne tuned the output
of the Dollar edge detector [6], using the publicly available
structured edge detection toolbox. From the edge map and
its associated edge strength, we produced a binarized ver-
sion, using per image adaptive thresholding. The binarized
edge map was then processed to obtain contour fragments
of width 1 pixel. Each contour fragment was then spatially
smoothed by convolution of the coordinates of points along
it, using a Gaussian with σ = 1, to mitigate discretization
artifacts. The same parameters were used to produce all the
MIT67 and Places365 line drawings. Figure 3 presents a
comparison of a resultant machine-generated and an artist-
generated line drawing for an ofﬁce scene from the Artist
Scenes database. We have conﬁrmed that on the artist’s line
drawing database 90% of the machine generated contour
pixels are in common with the artist’s line drawings. Figure
4 shows several typical machine generated line drawings
from the MIT67 and Places365 databases, but weighted by
our perceptual salience measures.

4.3. Computing Contour Salience

Computing contour salience for each line drawing re-
quired a number of steps. First, each connected region be-
tween scene contours was extracted. Second, we computed

database.

an AOF map for each of these connected components, as
explained in Section 2. For this we used a disk of radius
1 pixel, with 60 discrete sample points on it, to estimate
the AOF integral. We used a threshold of τ = 0.25 on the
AOF map, which corresponds to an object angle θ ≈ 23 de-
grees, to extract skeletal points. A typical example appears
in Figure 1 (top right). The resulting AOF skeleton was then
partitioned into medial curves between branch points or be-
tween a branch point and an endpoint. We then computed
a discrete version of each of the three salience measures in
Section 3, within a interval [α, β ] of length 2K + 1, centered
at each medial axis point, with K = 5 pixels. Each scene
contour point was then assigned the maximum of the two
salience values at the closest points on the medial curves on
either side of it, as illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom middle
and bottom right).

4.4. Experiments on 50 50 Splits of Contour Scenes

Our ﬁrst set of experiments is motivated by recent work
that shows that human observers beneﬁt from contour sym-
metry in scene recognition from contours [23]. Our goal is
to examine whether a CNN-based system also beneﬁts from
such perceptually motivated cues. Accordingly, we created
splits of the top 50% and the bottom 50% of the contour
pixels in each image of the Artist Scenes and MIT67 data
sets, using the three salience measures, ribbon symmetry,
taper symmetry and local contour separation. An example
of the original intact line drawing and each of the three sets
of splits is shown in Figure 5, for the highway scene from
the Artist Scenes dataset shown in Figure 1.

On the Artist Scenes dataset human observers were
tasked with determining to which of six scene categories
an exemplar belonged. The input was either the artist-
generated line drawing or the top or the bottom half of a split
by one of the salience measures. Images were presented for
only 58 ms, and were followed by a perceptual mask, mak-
ing the task difﬁcult for observers, who would otherwise
perform near 100% correct. The results with these short im-
age presentation durations, shown in Figure 6 (top), demon-
strate that human performance is consistently better with the
top (more salient) half of each split than the bottom one, for

each salience measure. The human performance is slightly
boosted for all conditions in the separation splits, for which
a different subject pool was used.

Carrying out CNN-based recognition on the Artist
Scenes and MIT67 line drawing datasets presents the chal-
lenge that they are too small to train a large model, such as

VGG-16, from scratch. To the best of our knowledge, no
CNN-based scene categorization work has so far focused
on line drawings of natural images. We therefore use CNNs
that are pre-trained on RGB photographs for our experi-
ments.

For our experiments on the Artist and MIT67 datasets,

as the prediction output. For the Places365 dataset, which
contains 1.8 million images, we used Resnet50 [10] with
its weights obtained by training on ImageNet, but rather
than ﬁne-tune the network, we used the ﬁnal fully connected
layer output as a feature vector input to an SVM classiﬁer.
For all experiments on the Artist Scenes we use 5-fold cross
validation. Top-1 classiﬁcation accuracy is given, as a mean
over the 5 folds, in Figure 6 (middle). The CNN-based sys-
tem mimics the trend we saw in human observers, namely
that performance is consistently better for the top 50% of
each of the three splits. We interpret this as evidence that all
three Gestalt motivated salience measures are beneﬁcial for
scene categorization in both computer and human vision.

For MIT67 we use the provided training/test splits and
present the average results over 5 trials. The CNN-based
categorization results are shown in Figure 6 (bottom row).
It is striking that even for this more challenging database,
the CNN-based system still mimics the trend we saw in hu-
man observers, i.e., that performance is better on the top
50% than on the bottom 50% of each of the three splits and
is well above chance. For both the CNN and human cate-
gorization experiments, we run t-tests (see Table 1) which
show that for both the group differences are statistically sig-
niﬁcant.

4.5. Experiments with Salience Weighted Contours

While we would expect that network performance would
degrade when losing half the input pixels, the splits also re-
veal a signiﬁcant bias in favor of our salience measures to
support scene categorization. Can we exploit this bias to
improve network performance when given the intact con-
tours? To address this question, we carry out a second ex-
periment where we explicitly encode salience measures for
the CNN by feeding different features into the R, G, and B
color channels of the pre-trained network. We do this by
using, in addition to the contour image channel, additional
channels with the same contours weighted by our proposed
salience measures, each of which is in the interval [0, 1].

to the results obtained by using contours alone. In all cases
the best performance boost comes from a combination of
contours, ribbon or taper symmetry salience, and separation
salience. We believe this is because taper between local
contours as a perceptual salience measure is conceptually
very close to our ribbon salience measure. Local separation
salience, on the other hand, provides a more distinct and
complementary perceptual cue for grouping.

For MIT67 the performance of 64.87% on photographs
is exactly consistent with that reported in [24]. Remark-
ably, two-thirds of this level of performance (42.8%) is
obtained using only machine generated line drawings, and
this goes up to three-fourths (48.6%) when using contours
weighted by ribbon and separation salience. For MIT67
we have also compared (ﬁne-tuned) Hybrid1365 VGG on
photographs (78.74% top-1) versus photographs with con-
tours, ribbon, and separation salience weighted contours
overlayed (80.45% top-1).

Encouraged by the above results, we repeated the
same experiment for the much more challenging Places365
dataset, but this time using just a pre-trained network and
a linear SVM. For this dataset chance recognition perfor-
mance would be at 1/365 or 0.27%. Our results are shown
in Table 3. Once again we see a clear and consistent trend
of a beneﬁt using salience weighted contours as additional
feature channels to the contours themselves, with the best
performance gain coming from the addition of ribbon sym-

metry salience and separation salience.

5. Conclusion

We have reported the ﬁrst study on CNN based recogni-
tion of complex natural scenes from line drawings derived
from 3 databases of increasing complexity. To this end, we
have demonstrated the clear beneﬁt of using Gestalt moti-
vated medial axis based salience measures, to weight scene
contours according to their local ribbon and taper symme-
try, and local contour separation. We hypothesize that mak-
ing such contour salience weights explicit helps a deep net-
work organize visual information to support categorization,
in a manner which is not by default learned by these net-
works from the scene contour images alone. In our experi-
ments, we used different CNN models to isolate the effect of
these perceptually motivated scene contour grouping cues,
and also the potential to perform scene categorization from
contours alone, with color, shading and texture absent. In
the artist’s line drawings, MIT67 and Places365 databases,
the percentage of contour ink pixels over all the RGB pix-
els in the photographs, is only 7.44%, 8.75% and 8.32%, on
average.

The possibility to train a CNN model from scratch us-
ing our 1.8 million line drawings of Places365 now lies
ahead. The feasibility of fully trained networks on draw-
ings has been demonstrated by work on free-hand sketches
[25], which, despite its superﬁcial similarity with our work,
follows a very different purpose. We plan on making our
contour salience measure computation code, and our line
drawing databases, publicly available.
