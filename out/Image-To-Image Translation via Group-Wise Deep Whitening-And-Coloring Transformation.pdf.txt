Abstract

Recently, unsupervised exemplar-based image-to-image
translation, conditioned on a given exemplar without the
paired data, has accomplished substantial advancements.
In order to transfer the information from an exemplar to
an input image, existing methods often use a normaliza-
tion technique, e.g., adaptive instance normalization, that
controls the channel-wise statistics of an input activation
map at a particular layer, such as the mean and the vari-
ance. Meanwhile, style transfer approaches similar task to
image translation by nature, demonstrated superior per-
formance by using the higher-order statistics such as co-
variance among channels in representing a style. In de-
tail, it works via whitening (given a zero-mean input fea-
ture, transforming its covariance matrix into the identity).
followed by coloring (changing the covariance matrix of
the whitened feature to those of the style feature). How-
ever, applying this approach in image translation is com-
putationally intensive and error-prone due to the expensive
time complexity and its non-trivial backpropagation. In re-
sponse, this paper proposes an end-to-end approach tai-
lored for image translation that efﬁciently approximates this
transformation with our novel regularization methods. We
further extend our approach to a group-wise form for mem-
ory and time efﬁciency as well as image quality. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
our proposed method is fast, both in training and inference,
and highly effective in reﬂecting the style of an exemplar.

1. Introduction

in short,

image translation,

Since the introduction of

image-to-image transla-
tion [16],
it has gained
signiﬁcant attention from relevant ﬁelds and constantly
evolved propelled by the seminal generative adversarial net-
works [10]. The primary goal of image translation [16, 35]
is to convert particular attributes of an input image in an
original domain to a target one, while maintaining other se-
mantics. Early models for image translation required train-

ing data as paired images of an input and its correspond-
ing output images, allowing a direct supervision. Cycle-
GAN [35] successfully extends it toward unsupervised im-
age translation [25, 2, 4, 35] by proposing the cycle consis-
tency loss, which allows the model to learn the distinctive
semantic difference between the collections of two image
domains and translate the corresponding style without a di-
rect pair-wise supervision.

Nonetheless, CycleGAN is still unimodal in that it can
only generate a single output for a single input. Instead,
image translation should be capable of generating multi-
ple possible outputs even for a single given input, e.g., nu-
merous possible gender-translated outputs of a single fa-
cial image. Subsequently, two notable methods, DRIT [20]
and MUNIT [14], have been proposed to address the mul-
timodal nature of unsupervised image translation. They
demonstrate that a slew of potential outputs could be gen-
erated given a single input image, based on either a random
sampling process in the midst of translation or utilizing an
additional, exemplar image for a detailed guidance toward
a desired style.

They both have two separate encoders corresponding to
the content image (an input) and style image (an exemplar),
and combine the content feature and style feature together
to produce the ﬁnal output. DRIT concatenates the encoded
content and style feature vectors, while MUNIT exploits the
adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN), a method ﬁrst in-
troduced in the context of style transfer. AdaIN matches two
channel-wise statistics, the mean and variance, of the en-
coded content feature with the style feature, which is proven
to perform well in image translation.

However, we hypothesize that matching only these two
statistics may not reﬂect the target style well enough, ending
up with the sub-optimal quality of image outputs on numer-
ous occasions, as we conﬁrm through our experiments in
Section 4. That is, the interaction effects among variables,
represented as the Gram matrix [8] or the covariance ma-
trix [22], can convey critical information of the style, which
is agreed by extensive studies [8, 7, 22]. In response, to fully
utilize the style information of an exemplar, we propose a

novel method that takes into account such interaction effects
among feature channels, in the context of image translation.
is mainly motivated by whitening-and-
coloring transformation (WCT) [23], which utilizes the
pair-wise feature covariances, in addition to the mean and
the variance of each single feature, to encode the style of an
image. To elaborate, whitening refers to the normalization
process to make every covariance term (between a pair of
variables) as well as every variance term (within each sin-
gle variable) as a unit value, with given an input whose each
single variable is zero-meaned. This plays a role in remov-
ing (or neutralizing) the style. On the other hand, coloring
indicates the procedure of matching the covariance of the
style to that of the content feature, which imposes the in-
tended style into an neutralized input image.

The problem when applying WCT in image translation
is that its time complexity is as expensive as O(n3) where
n is the number of channels of a given activation map.
Furthermore, computing the backpropagation with respect
to singular value decomposition involved in WCT is non-
trivial [30, 15]. To address these issues, we propose a novel
deep whitening-and-coloring transformation that ﬂexibly
approximates the existing WCT based on deep neural net-
works. We further extend our method into group-wise deep
whitening-and-coloring transformation (GDWCT), which
does not only reduce the number of parameters and the
training time but also boosts the generated image qual-
ity [32, 12].

The main contribution of this paper includes:

• We present the novel deep whitening-and-coloring ap-
proach that allows an end-to-end training in image trans-
lation for conveying profound style semantics.

• We also propose the group-wise deep whitening-and-
coloring algorithm to further increase the computational
efﬁciency through a simple forward propagation, which
achieves highly competitive image quality.

• We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, com-
pared to state-of-the-art methods.

2. Related Work

Image-to-image translation.
Image-to-image translation
aims at converting an input image to another image with
a target attribute. Many of its applications exist, e.g., col-
orization [34, 5, 1, 33], super-resolution [6, 19], and domain
adaptation [11, 21].

A slew of studies have been conducted in an unsuper-
vised setting of image translation [35, 18, 25]. StarGAN [4]
proposes a single uniﬁed model which can handle unsuper-
vised image translation among multiple different domains.
Several studies [9, 36] focus on the limitation of earlier
work in which they produce a single output given an in-

put without consideration that diverse images can be gener-
ated within the same target domain. However, they are not
without limitations, either by generating a limited number
of outputs [9] or requiring paired images [36].

Recently proposed approaches [14, 20] are capable of
generating multimodal outputs in an unsupervised man-
ner. They work mainly based on the assumption that a la-
tent image space could be separated into a domain-speciﬁc
style space a domain-invariant content spaces. Following
the precedents, we also adopt the separate encoders to ex-
tract out each of the content and style features.

Style transfer. Gatys et al. [7, 8] show that the pair-
wise feature interactions obtained from the Gram matrix
or the covariance matrix of deep neural networks success-
fully capture the image style. It is used for transferring the
style information from a style image to a content image by
matching the statistics of the style feature with those of
the content. However, they require a time-consuming, it-
erative optimization process during the inference time in-
volving multiple forward and backward passes to obtain
a ﬁnal result. To address the limitation, alternative meth-
ods [29, 3, 17] have achieved a superior time efﬁciency
through feed-forward networks approximating an optimal
result of the iterative methods.

However, these models are incapable of transferring an
unseen style from an arbitrary image. To alleviate the limi-
tation, several approaches enable an unseen, arbitrary neu-
ral style transfer [13, 23, 24]. AdaIN [13] directly computes
the afﬁne parameters from the style feature and aligns the
mean and variance of the content feature with those of the
style feature. WCT [23] encodes the style as the feature co-
variance matrix, so that it effectively captures the rich style
representation. Recently, a new approach [21] have approx-
imated the whitening-and-coloring transformation as a one-
time transformation through a single transformation matrix.
Even though the idea of learning the transformation is sim-
ilar to ours, the proposed networks are incapable of trans-
ferring the semantic style information, such as the transla-
tion between the cat and the dog because the existing ap-
proach can transfer only the general style, such as the color
and the texture. Moreover, its settings of approximating the
transformation is less rigorous than ours due to the lack of
the regularization for ensuring the whitening-and-coloring
transformation.

reconstructed image xBAB by combining the content feature cBA and the style feature sAB.

3.1. Model Overview

Let xA ∈ XA and xB ∈ XB denote images from two
different image domains, XA, XB, respectively. Inspired by
MUNIT [14] and DRIT [20], we assume that the image x
can be decomposed into the domain-invariant content space
C and the domain-speciﬁc style spaces {SA, SB}, i.e.,

{cA, sA} = {Ec

A(xA), Es

A(xA)}

{cB, sB} = {Ec

cA ∈ C, sA ∈ SA

cB ∈ C, sB ∈ SB,

where {Ec
B} are the content and style
encoders for each domain, respectively. Our objective is to
generate the translated image by optimizing the functions
{fA→B, fB→A} of which fA→B maps the data point xA
in the original domain XA to the point xA→B in the target
domain XB, reﬂecting a given reference xB, i.e.,

xA→B = fA→B(xA, xB) = GB(Ec

A(xA), Es

B(xB))

xB→A = fB→A(xB, xA) = GA(Ec

where {GA, GB} are the generators for the corresponding
domains.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the group-wise deep whitening-
and-coloring transformation (GDWCT), plays a main role
in applying the style feature s to the content feature c inside
the generator G. Concretely, GDWCT takes the content fea-
ture cA, the matrix for coloring transformation sCT
B , and the
mean of the style s µ
B as input and conduct a translation of
cA to cA→B, formulated as

cA→B = GDWCT(cA, s CT

The different layers of a model focus on different in-
formation (e.g., the low-level feature captures a local ﬁne
pattern, whereas the high-level one captures a complicated
pattern across a wide area). We thus add our GDWCT mod-
ule in each residual block Ri of the generator GB as shown
in Fig. 2. By injecting the style information across multiple
hops via a sequence of GDWCT modules, our model can
simultaneously reﬂect both the ﬁne- and coarse-level style
information.

3.2. Loss Functions

Following MUNIT [14] and DRIT [20], we adopt both
the latent-level and the pixel-level reconstruction losses.
First, we use the style consistency loss between two style
features (sA→B, sB), so that it encourages the model to re-
ﬂect the style of the reference image sB to the translated
image xA→B, i.e.,

LA→B

Second, we utilize the content consistency loss between two
content features (cA, cA→B) to enforce the model to main-
tain the content feature of the input image cA after being
translated cA→B, i.e. ,

Third, in order to guarantee the performance of our model
through pixel-level supervision, we adopt the cycle consis-
tency loss and the identity loss [35] to obtain a high-quality
image, i.e.,

Lastly, we use an adversarial loss for minimizing the dis-
crepancy between the distribution of the real image and
that of the generated image. In particular, we employ LS-
GAN [27] as the adversarial method, i.e.,

3.3. Group wise Deep Whitening and Coloring

Transformation

For concise expression, we omit the domain notation un-

less needed, such as c = {cA, cB}, s = {sA, sB}, etc.

Whitening transformation (WT). WT is a linear trans-
formation that makes the covariance matrix of a given in-
put into an identity matrix. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst subtract
the content feature c ∈ RC×BHW by its mean c µ, where
(C, B, H, W ) represent the number of channels, batch size,
height, and width, respectively. We then compute the outer
product of the zero-meaned c along the BHW dimension.

where Qc ∈ RC×C is the orthogonal matrix containing the
eigenvectors, and Λc ∈ RC×C indicates the diagonal ma-
trix of which each diagonal element is the eigenvalue corre-
sponding to each column vector of Qc. The whitening trans-
formation is deﬁned as

cw = QcΛ

− 1
c QT

c (c − c µ),

(1)

where cw denotes the whitened feature. However, as pointed
out in Section 1, eigendecomposition is not only compu-
tationally intensive but also difﬁcult to backpropagate the
gradient signal. To alleviate the problem, we propose the
deep whitening transformation (DWT) approach such that
the content encoder Ec can naturally encode the whitened
feature cw, i.e., cw = c − c µ, where Ec(xc) = c. To this
end, we propose the novel regularization term that makes
the covariance matrix of the content feature Σc as close as
possible to the identity matrix, i.e.,

Rw = E[kΣc − Ik1,1].

(2)

Thus, the whitening transformation in Eq. (1) is reduced to
cw = c − c µ in DWT.

However, several limitations exist in DWT. First of all,
estimating the full covariance matrix using a small batch
of given data is inaccurate [12]. Second, performing DWT
with respect to the entire channels may excessively throw
away the content feature, compared to channel-wise stan-
dardization. We therefore improve DWT by grouping chan-
nels and applying DWT to the individual group.

Concretely, the channel dimension of c is re-arranged at
a group level, i.e., c ∈ RG×(C/G)×BHW , where G is the
number of groups. After obtaining the covariance matrix Σc
in RG×(C/G)×(C/G), we apply Eq. (2) along its group di-
mension. Note that group-wise DWT (GDWT) is the same
with DWT during the forward phase, as shown in Fig. 3(a),
because the re-arranging procedure is required for the regu-
larization (2).

Coloring transformation (CT). CT matches the covari-
ance matrix of the whitened feature with that of the style
feature Σs, where Σs is the covariance matrix of the style
feature. Σs is then decomposed into QsΛsQT
s , used for the
subsequent coloring transformation. This process is written
as

s cw,
where ccw denotes the colored feature.

ccw = QsΛ

Similar to WT, however, CT has the problems of
expensive time complexity and non-trivial backpropaga-
tion. Thus, We also replace CT with a simple but effec-
tive method that we call a deep coloring transformation

(DCT). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst obtain the matrix sCT through
MLP CT(s), where s = Es(x). We then decompose sCT into
two matrices by computing its column-wise L2 norm, i.e.,
sCT = U D, where the i-th column vector ui of U ∈ RC×C
is the unit vector, and D ∈ RC×C is the diagonal matrix
whose diagonal entries correspond to the L2 norm of each
column vector of sCT. We assume that those matrices U D
is equal to two matrices in Eq. (3), i.e., U D = QsΛ

s .

In order to properly work as Qs and Λ

s , U needs to be
an orthogonal matrix, and every diagonal entry in the matrix
D should be positive. To assure the conditions, we add the
regularization for U to encourage the column vectors of U
to be orthogonal, i.e.,

pute the matrix multiplication with X and the whitened fea-
ture cw, thus Eq. (5) being reduced to

ccw = Xφ(cw),

where φ denotes a reshaping operation φ : RC×H×W →
RC×HW . Finally, we add the new mean vector s µ to the
ccw, where s µ = MLP µ(s), as shown in Fig. 3(c). We em-
pirically set λw = 0.001, λc = 10, and G = 4, 8, 16.

4. Experiments

This section describes the baseline models and the
datasets. Implementation details as well as additional com-
parisons and results are included in the appendix.

Rc = Es [kU T U − Ik1,1].

4.1. Experimental Setup

The diagonal matrix D has its diagonal elements as the
column-wise L2 norm of sCT, such that its diagonal entries
are already positive. Thus, it does not necessitate additional
regularization. Meanwhile, U becomes the orthogonal ma-
trix if U accomplishes the orthogonality, because each col-
umn vector ui of U has a unit L2 norm. That is, with the
regularization Eq. (4), U D satisﬁes the entire conditions to
s . Finally, combining U and D, we simplify CT as
be QsΛ

ccw = U DU T cw.

(5)

However, approximating the entire matrix sCT has an
expensive computational cost (the number of parameters
to estimate is C 2). Hence, we extend DCT to the group-
wise DCT (GDCT) and reduce the number of parameters
from C 2 to C 2/G, as the detailed steps are illustrated in
Fig. 3(b). We ﬁrst obtain the i-th matrix {U DU T }i ∈
R(C/G)×(C/G) for GDCT for i = {1, ..., G}. We then form
a block diagonal matrix X ∈ RC×C by arranging the ma-
trices {U DU T }1,...,G. Next, as shown in Fig. 3(d), we com-

Datasets. We evaluate GDWCT with various datasets
including CelebA [26], Artworks [35] (Ukiyoe, Monet,
Cezanne, and Van Gogh), cat2dog [20], Pen ink and Wa-
tercolor classes of the Behance Artistic Media (BAM) [31],
and Yosemite [35] (summer and winter scenes) datasets.

Baseline methods. We exploit MUNIT [14], DRIT [20],
and WCT [23] as our baselines because those methods are
the state-of-the-art in image translation and style transfer,
respectively. MUNIT and DRIT utilize different methods
when applying the style into the content from GDWCT.
MUNIT leverages AdaIN [13] while DRIT is based on con-
catenation of the content and the style features. Meanwhile,
WCT applies the whitening-and-coloring transformation to
the features extracted from the pretrained encoder, in order
to transfer the style into the content image.

4.2. Quantitative Analysis

We compare the performance of our model with the base-

lines with user study and classiﬁcation accuracy.

User study. We ﬁrst conduct a user study using CelebA
dataset [26]. The initial motivation of our user study was to
measure user preferences on outputs produced by GDWCT
and the baseline models with a focus on the quality of an
output and the rendering of the style given in an exemplar.
Each user evaluated 60 sets of image comparisons, choosing
one among four candidates within 30 seconds per compar-
ison. We informed the participants of the original and the
target domains for every run, e.g., Male to Female, so that
they can understand exactly which style in an exemplar is of
interest. Table 1 summarizes the result. It is found that the
users prefer our model to other baseline models on ﬁve out
of six class pairs. In the translation of Female ⇒ Male, be-
cause DRIT consistently generates a facial hair in all trans-
lation, it may obtain the higher score than ours. The superior
measures demonstrate that our model produces visual com-

pelling images. Furthermore, the result indicates that our
model reﬂect the style from the exemplar better than other
baselines, which justiﬁes that matching entire statistics in-
cluding a covariance would render style more effectively.

Classiﬁcation accuracy. A well-trained image transla-
tion model would generate outputs that are classiﬁed as an
image from the target domain. For instance, when we trans-
late a female into male, we measure the classiﬁcation accu-
racy in the gender domain. A high accuracy indicate that the
model learns deterministic patterns to be represented in the
target domain. We report the classiﬁcation results on trans-
lated images in Table 2. For the classiﬁcation, we adopted
the pretrained Inception-v3 [28], and ﬁne-tuned on CelebA
dataset. Our model records competitive average on the ac-
curacy rate, marginally below DRIT on Gender class, and
above on Bangs and Smile.

Inference time. The superiority of GDWCT also lies in
the speed at which outputs are computed in the inference
stage. Table 3 shows that our model is as fast as the ex-
isting image translation methods, and has the capacity of

4.3. Qualitative Results

In this section, we analyze the effects of diverse hyper-

parameters and devices on the ﬁnal image outputs.

Stylization comparisons. We conduct qualitative analy-
ses by a comparison with the baseline models on Fig. 4.
Each row represents different classes, and the leftmost and
the second columns are content and the exemplar style, re-
spectively. Across diverse classes, we observe consistent
patterns for each baseline model. First, MUNIT tends to
keep the object boundary, leaving not much room for style
to get in. DRIT shows results of high contrast, and actively
transfer the color. WCT is more artistic in the way it digests
the given style, however at times losing the original content
to a large extent. Our results transfer object colors as well
as the overall mood in the style, while not overly blurring
details. We provide additional results of our model in Fig. 9.
We believe our work gives another dimension of an oppor-
tunity to translate image at one’s discretion.

Number of hops on style. As we previously discussed in
Fig. 2, the proposed GDWTC could be applied in multi-
hops. We demonstrate the effects of the different num-
ber of hops on the style. To this end, we use Artworks
dataset (Ukiyoe) [35]. We train two identical models dif-
ferent only in the number of hops, a single hop (GDWTC1)
or multi-hops (GDWTC1−5). In Fig. 5, the rightmost im-
age (GDWTC1−5) has the style that agrees with the de-
tailed style given in the leftmost image. The third image
(GDWTC1) follows the overall color pattern of the exem-
plar, but with details less transferred. For example, the writ-
ing in the background has not been transferred to the result

of GDWCT1, but is clearly rendered on GDWTC1−5. The
difference comes from a capacity of the multiple hops on a
stylization, which covers both ﬁne and coarse style [23].

Effects of regularization. We verify the inﬂuences of the
regularizations Rw and Rc on the ﬁnal image output. In-
tuitively, a higher λw will strengthen the whitening trans-
formation, erasing the style more, because it encourages the
covariance matrix of the content feature to be closer to the
identity matrix. Likewise, a high value of λc would result
in a diverse level of style, since the intensity of the style
applied during coloring increases as the eigenvectors of the
style feature gets closer to orthogonal.

We use two classes, Watercolor and Pen Ink, of
BAM [31] dataset. The images in Fig. 6 illustrates the re-
sults of (watercolor → penink). Given the leftmost content
and style as input, the top row shows the effects of grad-
ually increasing value of λw. A large λw leads the model
to erase textures notably in the cloth and hair. It proves our
presumption that the larger w is, the stronger the effects of
the whitening is. Meanwhile, the second row shows the ef-
fects of different coloring coefﬁcient λc. The cloth of the
subjects shows a stark difference, gradually getting darker,
applying the texture of the style more intensively.

Visualization of whitening-and-coloring transformation.
We visualize the whitened feature to visually inspect the in-
ﬂuence of the proposed group-wise deep whitening trans-
formation on the content image. We also use a sample
from Artworks dataset. For visualization, we forward the
whitened feature into the networks without coloring trans-
formation. The third image from the left shows the whiten-
ing effects. It is evident that in the image, detailed style re-
garding the color and texture are erased from the content
image. Notably, the reeds around the river, and the clouds
in the sky are found to be whitened in color, being ready to
be stylized. On the other hand, the rightmost image stylizes
given the whitened image via the group-wise deep coloring
transformation. It reveals that the coloring transformation
properly applies the exemplar style, which is in a simpler
style with monotonous color than that of the content image.

Comparison on face attribute translation. We compare
GDWCT with the baselines using CelebA dataset with the
image size of 216×216. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
Two columns from the left of each macro column denote a
content image and a style image (exemplar), respectively,
while the other columns indicates outputs of compared
models. Each row of each macro column illustrates the dif-
ferent target attribute. Our model shows a superior perfor-
mance in overall attribute translation, because our model
drastically but suitably applies the style compared to the
baselines. For example, In case of (male → female) trans-
lation, our model generates an image with long hair and
make-up, the major patterns of the woman. However, each
generated image from MUNIT and DRIT wears only light
make-up with incomplete long hair. Meanwhile, in both
translation cases of Smile and Bangs, the outputs of MU-
NIT show less capacity than ours in transferring the style
as shown in (Smile → Non-Smile), (Non-Bang → Bang),
and (Bang → Non-Bang), because MUNIT matches only
mean and variance of the style to those of the content when
conducting a translation. On the other hand, DRIT conducts
unnatural translation (two rows from the bottom) comparing
with ours. In case of (Non-Smile → Smile), DRIT applies
the style only into a mouth but ours converts both eyes and
mouth. Meanwhile, as seen in overall cases of WCT, it can-
not perform image translation because it does not learn to
transfer the semantic style.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, group-wise
deep whitening-and-coloring transformation (GDWCT) for

an improved stylization capability. Our experiments demon-
strate that our work produces competitive outputs in image
translation as well as style transfer domains, having a ma-
jority of real users agree that our model successfully reﬂects
the given exemplar style. We believe this work bears the
potential to enrich relevant academic ﬁelds with the novel
framework and practical performances.
