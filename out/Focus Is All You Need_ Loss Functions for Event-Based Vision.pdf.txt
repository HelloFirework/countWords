Figure 1: Motion Compensation Framework. Events in a space-time window are warped according to point trajectories
described by motion parameters θ, resulting in an image of warped events (IWE) I(x; θ). Then, a focus loss function of I
measures how well events are aligned along the point trajectories. This work proposes multiple focus loss functions for event
alignment (last block in the ﬁgure and Table 1) for tasks such as rotational motion, depth and optical ﬂow estimation.

Abstract

Event cameras are novel vision sensors that output pixel-
level brightness changes (“events”) instead of traditional
video frames. These asynchronous sensors offer several ad-
vantages over traditional cameras, such as, high temporal
resolution, very high dynamic range, and no motion blur. To
unlock the potential of such sensors, motion compensation
methods have been recently proposed. We present a collec-
tion and taxonomy of twenty two objective functions to an-
alyze event alignment in motion compensation approaches
(Fig. 1). We call them focus loss functions since they have
strong connections with functions used in traditional shape-
from-focus applications. The proposed loss functions allow
bringing mature computer vision tools to the realm of event
cameras. We compare the accuracy and runtime perfor-
mance of all loss functions on a publicly available dataset,
and conclude that the variance, the gradient and the Lapla-
cian magnitudes are among the best loss functions. The ap-
plicability of the loss functions is shown on multiple tasks:
rotational motion, depth and optical ﬂow estimation. The
proposed focus loss functions allow to unlock the outstand-
ing properties of event cameras.

1. Introduction

Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that work radi-
cally different from traditional cameras. Instead of captur-
ing brightness images at a ﬁxed rate, they measure bright-

ness changes asynchronously. This results in a stream
of events, which encode the time, location and polarity
(sign) of the brightness changes. Event cameras, such as
the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) [1] posses outstanding
properties compared to traditional cameras: very high dy-
namic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), high temporal resolu-
tion (in the order of µs), and do not suffer from motion
blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential to tackle
challenging scenarios for standard cameras (such as high
speed and high dynamic range) in tracking [2–9], depth
estimation [10–19], Simultaneous Localization and Map-
ping [20–27], and recognition [28–32], among other appli-
cations. However, novel methods are required to process
the unconventional output of these sensors in order to un-
lock their potential.

Motion compensation approaches [15, 19, 33–42] have
been recently introduced for processing the visual informa-
tion acquired by event cameras. They have proven suc-
cessful for the estimation of motion (optical ﬂow) [34–
36, 38, 39], camera motion [33, 35], depth (3D reconstruc-
tion) [15, 19, 38, 39] as well as segmentation [36, 40, 41].
The main idea of such methods consists of searching for
point trajectories on the image plane that maximize event
alignment [33, 35] (Fig. 1, right), which is measured us-
ing some loss function of the events warped according to
such trajectories. The best trajectories produce sharp, mo-
tion compensated images that reveal the brightness patterns
causing the events (Fig. 1, middle).

In this work, we build upon the motion compensation
framework [35] and extend it to include twenty more loss
functions for applications such as ego-motion, depth and

Event-based cameras, such as the DVS [1], have inde-
pendent pixels that output “events” in response to bright-
.

ness changes. Speciﬁcally, if L(x, t)
logarithmic brightness at pixel x .
= (x, y)⊤ on the im-
.
age plane, the DVS generates an event ek
= (xk, tk, pk)
if the change in logarithmic brightness at pixel xk reaches a
threshold C (e.g., 10-15% relative change):

∆L

.
= L(xk, tk) − L(xk, tk − ∆tk) = pk C,

(1)

where tk is the timestamp of the event, ∆tk is the time since
the previous event at the same pixel xk and pk ∈ {+1, −1}
is the event polarity (i.e., sign of the brightness change).

Therefore, each pixel has its own sampling rate (which
depends on the visual input) and outputs data proportionally
to the amount of motion in the scene. An event camera does
not produce images at a constant rate, but rather a stream of
asynchronous, sparse events in space-time (Fig. 1, left).

optical ﬂow estimation. We ask the question: What are
good metrics of event alignment? In answering, we noticed
strong connections between the proposed metrics (Table 1)
and those used for shape-from-focus and autofocus in con-
ventional, frame-based cameras [43, 44], and so, we called
the event alignment metrics “focus loss functions”. The ex-
tended framework allows mature computer vision tools to
be used on event data while taking into account all the infor-
mation of the events (asynchronous timestamps and polar-
ity). Additionally, it sheds light on the event-alignment goal
of functions used in existing motion-compensation works
and provides a taxonomy of loss functions for event data.

Contributions.

In summary, our contributions are:

1. The introduction and comparison of twenty two fo-
cus loss functions for event-based processing, many of
which are developed from basic principles, such as the
“area” of the image of warped events.

2. Connecting the topics of shape-from-focus, autofocus
and event-processing by the similar set of functions
used, thus allowing to bring mature analysis tools from
the former topics into the realm of event cameras.

3. A thorough evaluation on a recent dataset [45], com-
paring the accuracy and computational effort of the
proposed focus loss functions, and showing how they
can be used for depth and optical ﬂow estimation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
reviews the working principle of event cameras. Section 3
summarizes the motion compensation method and extends
it with the proposed focus loss functions. Experiments are
carried out in Section 4 comparing the loss functions, and
conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

3.1. Motion Compensation Framework

In short, the method in [35] seeks to ﬁnd the point-
trajectories on the image plane that maximize the alignment
of corresponding events (i.e., those triggered by the same
scene edge). Event alignment is measured by the strength
of the edges of an image of warped events (IWE), which is
obtained by aggregating events along candidate point trajec-
tories (Fig. 1). In particular, [35] proposes to measure edge
strength (which is directly related to image contrast [46])
using the variance of the IWE.

More speciﬁcally, the events in a set E = {ek}Ne

k=1 are

geometrically transformed

= (xk, tk, pk) 7→ e′k

.
= (x′k, tref, pk)

(2)

ek

according to a point-trajectory model W, resulting in a
set of warped events E′ = {e′k}Ne
k=1 “ﬂattened” at a ref-
erence time tref. The warp x′k = W(xk, tk; θ) transports
each event along the point trajectory that passes through
it (Fig. 1, left), until tref is reached, thus, taking into ac-
count the space-time coordinates of the event. The vector θ
parametrizes the point trajectories, and hence contains the
motion or scene parameters.

The image (or histogram) of warped events (IWE) is
given by accumulating events along the point trajectories:

I(x; θ)

Xk=1

bk δ(x − x′k(θ)),

(3)

where each pixel x sums the values bk of the warped events
x′k that fall within it (bk = pk if polarity is used or bk = 1 if
polarity is not used; see Fig. 2). In practice, the Dirac delta δ
is replaced by a smooth approximation, such as a Gaussian,
δ(x − µ) ≈ N (x; µ, ǫ2Id), with typically ǫ = 1 pixel.

3.2. Our Proposal: Focus Loss Functions

In (3) a group of events E has been effectively converted,
using the spatio-temporal transformation, into an image rep-
resentation (see Fig. 2), aggregating the little information
from individual events into a larger, more descriptive piece
of information. Here, we propose to exploit the advantages
that such an image representation offers, namely bringing
in tools from image processing (histograms, convolutions,
Fourier transforms, etc.) to analyze event alignment.

We study different image-based event alignment metrics
(i.e., loss functions), such as (4); that is, we study differ-
ent objective functions that can be used in the second block
of the diagram of Fig. 1 (highlighted in red). To the best
of our knowledge we are the ﬁrst to address the following
three related topics: (i) establishing connections between
event alignment metrics and so-called “focus measures” in
shape-from-focus (SFF) and autofocus (AF) in conventional
frame-based imaging [43, 44], (ii) comparing the perfor-
mance of the different metrics on event-based vision prob-
lems, and (iii) showing that it is possible to design new fo-
cus metrics tailored to edge-like images like the IWE.

Table 1 lists the multiple focus loss functions studied, the
majority of which are newly proposed, and categorizes them

according to their nature. The functions are classiﬁed ac-
cording to whether they are based on statistical or derivative
operators (or their combination), according to whether they
depend on the spatial arrangement of the pixel values or not,
and according to whether they are maximized or minimized.
The next sections present the focus loss functions using
two image characteristics related to edge strength: sharp-
ness (Section 3.3) and dispersion (Section 3.4). But ﬁrst,
let us discuss the variance loss, since it motivates several
focus losses.

Loss Function: Image Variance (Contrast). An event
alignment metric used in [33, 35] is the variance of the
IWE (4), known as the RMS contrast in image process-
ing [46]. The variance is a statistical measure of disper-
sion, in this case, of the pixel values of the IWE, regardless
of their spatial arrangement. Thus, event alignment (i.e.,
edge strength of the IWE) is here assessed using statistical
principles (Table 1). The motion parameters θ that best ﬁt
the events are obtained by maximizing the variance (4). In
the example of Fig. 2, it is clear that as event alignment in-
creases, so does the visual contrast of the IWE.

Fourier Interpretation: Using (i) the formula relating the
variance of a signal to its mean square (MS) and mean,
Var(I) = MS − µ2
I , and (ii) the interpretations of MS and
squared mean as the total “energy” and DC component of
the signal, respectively, yields that the variance represents
the AC component of the signal, i.e., the energy of the oscil-
lating, high frequency, content of the IWE. Hence, the IWE
comes into focus (Fig. 2) by increasing its AC component;
the DC component does not change signiﬁcantly during the
process. This interpretation is further developed next.

3.3. Image Sharpness

In the Fourier domain, sharp images (i.e., those with
strong edges, e.g., Fig. 2, right) have a signiﬁcant amount
of energy concentrated at high frequencies. The high-
frequency content of an image can be assessed by measur-
ing the magnitude of its derivative since derivative opera-
tors act as band-pass or high-pass ﬁlters. The magnitude is
given by any norm; however, the L2 norm is preferred since
it admits an inner product interpretation and simple deriva-
tives. The following losses are built upon this idea, using
ﬁrst and second derivatives, respectively. Similar losses,
based on the DCT or wavelet transforms [44] instead of
the Fourier transform are also possible. The main idea re-
mains the same: measure the high frequency content of the
IWE (i.e., edge strength) and ﬁnd the motion parameters
that maximize it, therefore maximizing event alignment.

Loss Function: Magnitude of Image Gradient. Event
alignment is achieved by seeking the parameters θ of the
point-trajectories that maximize

Loss Function: Magnitude of Image Hessian. For these

Loss Functions: DoG and LoG. The magnitude of the
output of established band-pass ﬁlters, such as the Differ-
ence of Gaussians (DoG) and the Laplacian of the Gaussian
(LoG), can also be used to assess the sharpness of the IWE.

Loss Function: Image Area.
Intuitively, sharp, motion-
compensated IWEs, have thinner edges than uncompen-
sated ones (Fig. 2). We now provide a deﬁnition of the
“thickness” or “support” of edge-like images (see supple-
mentary material) and use it for event alignment. We pro-
pose to minimize the support (i.e., area) of the IWE (3):

supp(I(x; θ)) = ZΩ

IWE and its corresponding support map, pseudo-colored as
a heat map: red regions (large IWE values) contribute more
to the support (8) than blue regions (small IWE values).

Our deﬁnition of the support of the IWE is very ﬂexible,
since it allows for different choices of the weighting func-
tion (Fig. 4). Speciﬁcally, we consider four choices:

1. Exponential: ρ(λ) = e−λ, F (λ) = 1 − e−λ.
2. Gaussian: ρ(λ) = 2√π e−λ2
, F (λ) = erf(λ).
3. Lorentzian: ρ(λ) =
4. Hyperbolic: ρ(λ) = sech2(λ), F (λ) = tanh(λ).

3.4. Image Dispersion (Statistics)

Besides the variance (4), other ways to measure disper-
sion are possible. These may be categorized according to
their spatial character: global (operating on the IWE pix-
els regardless of their arrangement) or local. Among the
global metrics for dispersion we consider the mean square
(MS), the mean absolute deviation (MAD), the mean abso-
lute value (MAV), the entropy and the range. In the group of
local dispersion losses we have: local versions of the above-
mentioned global losses (variance, MS, MAD, MAV, etc.)
and metrics of spatial autocorrelation, such as Moran’s I in-
dex [47] and Geary’s Contiguity Ratio [48].

12283

Loss Function: Mean Square. The Mean Square (MS)

MS(I) = kI(x; θ)k2

L2(Ω) / |Ω|,

(9)

also measures the dispersion of the IWE (with respect to
zero). As anticipated in the Fourier interpretation of the
variance, the MS is the total energy of the image, which
comprises an oscillation (i.e., dispersion) part and a con-
stant part (DC component or squared mean).

Loss Function: Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and
Mean Absolute Value (MAV). The analogous of the vari-
ance and the MS using the L1 norm are the MAD,

MAD(I) = kI(x; θ) − µI kL1(Ω) / |Ω|,

(10)

and the mean absolute value,

MAV(I) = kI(x; θ)kL1(Ω) / |Ω|,

(11)

respectively. The MAV provides a valid loss function to es-
timate θ if polarity is used. However, if polarity is not used,
the MAV coincides with the IWE mean, µI (which counts
the warped events in Ω), and since this value is typically
constant, the MAV does not provide enough information to
estimate θ in this case (as will be noted in Table 2).

Image Entropy.

Loss Function:
Information entropy
measures the uncertainty or spread (i.e., dispersion) of a
distribution, or, equivalently, the reciprocal of its concen-
tration. This approach consists of maximizing Shannon’s
entropy of the random variable given by the IWE pixels:

H (pI (z)) = −Z ∞

−∞

pI (z) log pI (z)dz

(12)

The PDF of the IWE is approximated by its histogram
(normalized to unit area). Comparing the PDFs of the
IWEs before and after motion compensation (last column
of Fig. 2), we observe two effects of event alignment: (i)
the peak of the distribution at I = 0 increases since the
image regions with almost no events grow (corresponding
to homogeneous regions of the brightness signal), and (ii)
the distribution spreads out away from zero: larger values
of |I(x)| are achieved. Hence, the PDF of the motion-
compensated IWE is more concentrated around zero and
more spread out away from zero than the uncompensated
one. Concentrating the PDF means decreasing the entropy,
whereas spreading it out means increasing the entropy. To
obtain a high contrast IWE, with sharper edges, the second
approach must dominate. Hence, parameters θ are obtained
by maximizing the entropy of the IWE (12).

Entropy can also be interpreted as a measure of diversity
in information content, and since (i) sharp images contain
more information than blurred ones [49], and (ii) our goal
is to have sharp images for better event alignment, thus our
goal is to maximize the information content of the IWE,
which is done by maximizing its entropy.

Loss Function: Image Range. As is well known, con-
trast is a measure of the oscillation (i.e., dispersion) of a
signal with respect to its background (e.g., Michelson con-
trast), and the range of a signal, range(I) = Imax − Imin,
measures its maximum oscillation. Hence, maximizing the
range of the IWE provides an alternative way to achieve
event alignment. However, the min and max statistics of an
image are brittle, since they can drastically change by mod-
ifying two pixels. Using the tools that lead to (8) (suppl.
material), we propose to measure image range more sensi-
bly by means of the support of the image PDF,

supp(pI ) = Z ∞

−∞

(F (pI (z)) − F (0)) dz,

(13)

where F (λ) is a primitive of the weight function ρ(λ) ≥ 0
(as in Fig. 4). Fig. 2 illustrates how the range of the IWE
is related to its sharpness: as the IWE comes into focus, the
image range (support of the histogram) increases.

Next, we present focus loss functions based on local ver-

sions of the above global statistics.

Loss Function: Local Variance, MS, MAD and MAV.
Mimicking (5), which aggregates local measures of image
sharpness to produce a global score, we may aggregate the
local variance, MS, MAD or MAV of the IWE to produce a
global dispersion score that we seek to maximize. For ex-
ample, the aggregated local variance (ALV) of the IWE is

ALV(I)

Var(x; I)dx,

(14)

.

= ZΩ

where the local variance in a neighborhood B(x) ⊂ Ω cen-
tered about the point x is given by

.

Var(x; I)

.

|B(x)| ZB(x)(cid:0)I(u; θ) − µ(x; I)(cid:1)2

du, (15)

with local mean µ(x; I)

= RB(x) I(v; θ) dv/|B(x)| and
|B(x)| = RB(x) du. The local variance of an image (15) is

an edge detector similar to the magnitude of the image gra-
dient, k∇Ik. It may be estimated using a weighted neigh-
borhood B(x) by means of convolutions with a smoothing
kernel Gσ(x), such as a Gaussian:

Var(x; I) ≈ (I 2(x) ∗ Gσ(x)) − (I(x) ∗ Gσ(x))2 .
Based on the above example, local versions of the MS,

(16)

MAD and MAV can be derived (see suppl. material).

Loss Function: Spatial Autocorrelation. Spatial auto-
correlation of the IWE can also be used to assess event
alignment. We present two focus loss functions based on
spatial autocorrelation: Moran’s I and Geary’s C indices.

Moran’s I index is a number between −1 and 1 that eval-
uates whether the variable under study (i.e., the pixels of the
IWE) is clustered, dispersed, or random. Letting zi = I(xi)
be the value of the i-th pixel of the IWE, Moran’s index is

.

= Pi,j wij(zi − ¯z)(zj − ¯z)/W

Pi(zi − ¯z)2/Np

,

(17)

Moran(I)

12284

where ¯z ≡ µI is the mean of I, Np is the number of pixels
of I, (wij) is a matrix of spatial weights with zeros on the

diagonal (i.e., wii = 0) and W = Pi,j wij . The weights

wij encode the spatial relation between pixels zi and zj : we
use weights that decrease with the distance between pixels,
e.g., wij ∝ exp(−kxi − xjk2/2σ2
M ), with σM ≈ 1 pixel.
A positive Moran’s index value indicates tendency to-
ward clustering pixel values while a negative Moran’s in-
dex value indicates tendency toward dispersion (dissimilar
values are next to each other). Edges correspond to dissim-
ilar values close to each other, and so, we seek to minimize
Moran’s index of the IWE.

Geary’s Contiguity Ratio is a generalization of Von Neu-
mann’s ratio [50] of the mean square successive difference
to the variance:

C(I)

.
=

1

2 Pi,j wij(zi − zj)2/W
Pi(zi − ¯z)2/(Np − 1)

.

(18)

It is non-negative. Values around 1 indicate lack of spatial
autocorrelation; values near zero are positively correlated,
and values larger than 1 are negatively correlated. Moran’s
I and Geary’s C are inversely related, thus event alignment
is achieved by maximizing Geary’s C of the IWE.

3.5. Dispersion of Image Sharpness Values

We have also combined statistics-based loss functions
with derivative-based ones, yielding more loss functions
(Table 1), such as the variance of the Laplacian of the IWE
Var(∆I(x; θ)), the variance of the magnitude of the IWE
gradient Var(k∇I(x; θ)k), and the variance of the squared
magnitude of the IWE gradient Var(k∇I(x; θ)k2) ≡
Var(I 2
y ). They apply statistical principles to local focus
metrics based on neighborhood operations (convolutions).

3.6. Discussion of the Focus Loss Functions

Connection with Shape-from-Focus and Autofocus: Sev-
eral of the proposed loss functions have been proven suc-
cessful in shape-from-focus (SFF) and autofocus (AF) with
conventional cameras [43, 44, 51], showing that there is
a strong connection between these topics and event-based
motion estimation. The principle to solve the frame-based
and event-based problems is the same: maximize a focus
score of the considered image or histogram. In the case of
conventional cameras, SFF and AF maximize edge strength
at each pixel of a focal stack of images (in order to infer
depth). In the case of event cameras, the IWE (an image
representation of the events) plays the role of the images in
the focal stack: varying the parameters θ produces a differ-
ent “slice of the focal stack”, which may be used not only
to estimate depth, but also to estimate other types of param-
eters θ, such as optical ﬂow, camera velocities, etc.

Spatial Dependency: Focus loss functions based on
derivatives or on local statistics imply neighborhood oper-
ations (e.g., convolutions with nearby pixels of the IWE),

thus they depend on the spatial arrangement of the IWE
pixels (Table 1).
Instead, global statistics (e.g., variance,
entropy, etc.) do not directly depend on such spatial ar-
rangement1. The image area loss functions (8) are integrals
of point-wise functions of the IWE, and so, they do not de-
pend on the spatial arrangement of the IWE pixels. The
PDF of the IWE also does not have spatial dependency, nor
do related losses, such as entropy (12) or range (13). Com-
posite focus losses (Section 3.5), however, have spatial de-
pendency since they are computed from image derivatives.
Fourier Interpretation: Focus losses based on derivatives
admit an intuitive interpretation in the Fourier domain: they
measure the energy content in the high frequencies (i.e.,
edges) of the IWE (Section 3.3). Some of the statistical
focus losses also admit a frequency interpretation. For ex-
ample, image variance quantiﬁes the energy of the AC por-
tion (i.e., oscillation) of the IWE, and the MS measures the
energy of both, the AC and DC components. Other focus
functions, such as entropy, do not admit such a straightfor-
ward Fourier interpretation related to edge strength.

4. Experiments

In this section we compare the performance of the pro-
posed focus loss functions, which depends on multiple fac-
tors, such as, the task for which it is used, the number of
events processed, the data used, and, certainly, implementa-
tion. These factors produce a test space with an intractable
combinatorial size, and so, we choose the task for best as-
sessing accuracy on real data and then provide qualitative
results on other tasks: depth and optical ﬂow estimation.

4.1. Accuracy and Timing Evaluation

Rotational camera motion estimation provides a good
scenario for assessing accuracy since camera motion can
be reliably obtained with precise motion capture systems.
The acquisition of accurate per-event optical ﬂow or depth
is less reliable, since it depends on additional depth sensors,
such as RGB-D or LiDAR, which are prone to noise.

Table 2 compares the accuracy and timing of the focus
loss functions on the above scenario, using data from [45].
The data consists of sequences of one minute duration, with
increasing camera motion, reaching up to ≈ ±1000 ◦/s,
that is recorded using a motion-capture system with sub-
millimeter precision at 200 Hz. Each entry in Table 2 con-
sists of an experiment with more than 160 million events,
processed in groups of Ne = 30000 events. The focus loss
functions are optimized using non-linear conjugate gradi-
ent, initialized by the estimated angular velocity θ for the
previous group of events. As the table reports, the angu-
lar velocity errors (difference between the estimated angu-

1 The IWE consists of warped events, which depend on the location of
the events; however, by “directly” we mean that the focus loss function, by
itself, does not depend on the spatial arrangement of the IWE values.

Table 2: Accuracy and Timing Comparison of Focus Loss
Functions. RMS angular velocity errors (in ◦/s) of the mo-
tion compensation method [35] (with (w/) or without (w/o)
polarity) with respect to motion-capture system. Processing
Ne = 30 000 events, warped onto an image of 240 × 180
pixels (DAVIS camera [52]), takes 2040.24 µs, the runtime
of the focus loss functions is given in the last column. Se-
quences boxes and poster from dataset [45]. The best
value per column is highlighted in bold.

lar velocity θ that optimizes the focus loss function and
the velocity provided by the motion-capture system) vary
across loss functions. These columns summarize the RMS
errors (with and without using polarity), which are reported
in more detail in the supplementary material. Among the
most accurate focus loss functions are the ones based on the
derivatives of the IWE, high-pass ﬁlters and the ones based
on the variance (global or local), with less than 2.6 % error.
The entropy and support-based losses (area and range) are
not as accurate, yet the errors are small compared to the an-
gular velocity excursions (ωmax) in the sequences (less than
7 % error). In general, Table 2 shows that using polarity is
beneﬁcial; the results are slightly more accurate using po-
larity than not using it. The error boxplots of the gradient
magnitude (5), one of the most accurate focus loss functions
on Table 2, are given in Fig. 5.

Computational Cost. The last column of Table 2 com-
pares the losses in terms of computational effort, on a
single-core 2.7 GHz CPU. The variance is the fastest, with
17 µs (possibly due to efﬁcient code in OpenCV), and its
runtime is negligible compared to the time required to warp
the events (≈2 ms). The MS and the MAV are also fast.

Figure 5: Box plots of angular velocity error (estimated
vs. ground truth), per axis, for four subintervals of 15 s,
using the gradient magnitude (5) as focus loss function. The
method produces small errors: ≈18 ◦/s RMS (see Table 2),
i.e., 2.7 % with respect to |ωmax| = 670 ◦/s.

Other focus functions take longer, due to effort spent in spa-
tial operations (convolutions), and/or transcendental func-
tions (e.g., exp). The variance is a notable trade-off be-
tween accuracy and speed2. Computing the IWE has O(Ne)
complexity, but it is, to some extent, parallelizable. Loss
functions act on the IWE (with Np pixels), thus they have
O(Np) complexity.

4.2. Depth Estimation

We also qualitatively compared the loss functions in the
context of depth estimation. Here, the IWE is a slice of the
disparity space image (DSI) computed by back-projecting
events into a volume [15]. The DSI plays the role of the
focal stack in SFF and AF (Section 3.6). Depth at a pixel
of the reference view (θ ≡ Z) is estimated by selecting the
DSI slice with extremal focus along the optical ray of the
pixel. Fig. 6 shows the focus loss functions along an opti-
cal ray for the events in a small space-time window around
the pixel. The values of the focus losses come to an ex-
tremal at a common focal point (at depth ≈1.1 m). The
plots show that, in general, the focus functions monotoni-
cally decrease/increase as the distance from the focal plane
increases, forming the basin of attraction of the local ex-
trema. Composite losses (Section 3.5) have a narrow peak,
whereas others, such as the area losses have a wider peak.

4.3. Optical Flow Estimation

The proﬁle of the loss function can also be visualized
for 2D problems such as patch-based optical ﬂow [35].
Events in a small space-time window (e.g., 15 × 15 pix-
els) are warped according to a feature ﬂow vector θ ≡ v:
x′k = xk − (tk − tref)v. Fig. 7 shows the proﬁles of several

2Implementation plays a major role in runtime; thus the above ﬁgures
are illustrative. We built on top of the C++ Standard Library and OpenCV,
but did not optimize the code or used function approximation [53, 54].
[37,40] suggest considerable speed-up factors if warping is done on a GPU.

competitive focus losses. They all have a clear extremal at
the location of the visually correct ground truth ﬂow (point
0, green arrow in Fig. 7a). The Laplacian magnitude and
its variance show the narrowest peaks. Plots of more loss
functions are provided in the supplementary material.

4.4. Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow

The last row of Table 2 evaluates the accuracy and timing
of a loss function inspired in the time-based IWE of [37]:
the variance of the per-pixel average timestamp of warped
events. This loss function has been used in [39] for unsuper-
vised training of a neural network (NN) that predicts dense
optical ﬂow from events [55]. However, this loss function
is considerably less accurate than all other functions (Ta-
ble 2). This suggests that (i) loss functions based on times-
tamps of warped events are not as accurate as those based
on event count (the event timestamp is already taken into
account during warping), (ii) there is considerable room for

improvement in unsupervised learning of optical ﬂow if bet-
ter loss function is used.

To probe the applicability of the loss functions to es-
timate dense optical ﬂow, we trained a network inspired
in [55] using (5) and a Charbonier prior on the ﬂow deriva-
tive. The ﬂow produced by the NN increases event align-
ment (Fig. 8). A deeper evaluation is left for future work.

5. Conclusion

We have extended motion compensation methods for
event cameras with a library of twenty more loss functions
that measure event alignment. Moreover, we have estab-
lished a fundamental connection between the proposed loss
functions and metrics commonly used in shape from focus
with conventional cameras. This connection allows us to
bring well-established analysis tools and concepts from im-
age processing into the realm of event-based vision. The
proposed functions act as focusing operators on the events,
enabling us to estimate the point trajectories on the image
plane followed by the objects causing the events. We have
categorized the loss functions according to their capability
to measure edge strength and dispersion, metrics of infor-
mation content. Additionally, we have shown how to design
new focus metrics tailored to edge-like images like the im-
age of warped events. We have compared the performance
of all focus metrics in terms of accuracy and time. Simi-
larly to comparative studies in autofocus for digital photog-
raphy applications [51], we conclude that the variance, the
gradient magnitude and the Laplacian are among the best
functions. Finally, we have shown the broad applicability
of the functions to tackle essential problems in computer
vision: ego-motion, depth, and optical ﬂow estimation. We
believe the proposed focus loss functions are key to taking
advantage of the outstanding properties of event cameras,
specially in unsupervised learning of structure and motion.
