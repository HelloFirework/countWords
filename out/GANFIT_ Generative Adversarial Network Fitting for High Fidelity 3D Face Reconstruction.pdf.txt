Figure 1: The proposed deep ﬁtting approach can reconstruct high quality texture and geometry from a single image with
precise identity recovery. The reconstructions in the ﬁgure and the rest of the paper are represented by a vector of size 700

by our model and none of the features taken directly from the image.

Abstract

In the past few years, a lot of work has been done to-
wards reconstructing the 3D facial structure from single
images by capitalizing on the power of Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (DCNNs). In the most recent works, differ-
entiable renderers were employed in order to learn the rela-
tionship between the facial identity features and the param-
eters of a 3D morphable model for shape and texture. The
texture features either correspond to components of a lin-
ear texture space or are learned by auto-encoders directly
from in-the-wild images. In all cases, the quality of the fa-
cial texture reconstruction of the state-of-the-art methods is
still not capable of modeling textures in high ﬁdelity. In this
paper, we take a radically different approach and harness
the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
DCNNs in order to reconstruct the facial texture and shape
from single images. That is, we utilize GANs to train a very
powerful generator of facial texture in UV space. Then, we
revisit the original 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) ﬁtting
approaches making use of non-linear optimization to ﬁnd

the optimal latent parameters that best reconstruct the test
image but under a new perspective. We optimize the param-
eters with the supervision of pretrained deep identity fea-
tures through our end-to-end differentiable framework. We
demonstrate excellent results in photorealistic and identity
preserving 3D face reconstructions and achieve for the ﬁrst
time, to the best of our knowledge, facial texture reconstruc-
tion with high-frequency details.1

1. Introduction

Estimation of the 3D facial surface and other intrinsic
components of the face from single images (e.g., albedo,
etc.)
is a very important problem at the intersection of
computer vision and machine learning with countless ap-
plications (e.g., face recognition, face editing, virtual real-
ity). It is now twenty years from the seminal work of Blanz
and Vetter [4] which showed that it is possible to recon-
struct shape and albedo by solving a non-linear optimiza-

tion problem that is constrained by linear statistical models
of facial texture and shape. This statistical model of tex-
ture and shape is called a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM).
Arguably the most popular publicly available 3DMM is the
Basel model built from 200 people [20]. Recently, large
scale statistical models of face and head shape have been
made publicly available [7, 10].

For many years 3DMMs and its variants were the meth-
ods of choice for 3D face reconstruction [31, 42, 21].
Furthermore, with appropriate statistical texture models
on image features such as Scale Invariant Feature Trans-
form (SIFT) and Histogram Of Gradients (HOG), 3DMM-
based methodologies can still achieve state-of-the-art per-
formance in 3D shape estimation on images captured un-
der unconstrained conditions [6]. Nevertheless, those meth-
ods [6] can reconstruct only the shape and not the facial tex-
ture. Another line of research in [41, 32] decouples texture
and shape reconstruction. A standard linear 3DMM ﬁtting
strategy [38] is used for face reconstruction followed by a
number of steps for texture completion and reﬁnement. In
these papers [32, 41], the texture looks excellent when ren-
dered under professional renderers (e.g., Arnold), neverthe-
less when the texture is overlaid on the images the quality
signiﬁcantly drops 2.

In the past two years, a lot of work has been con-
ducted on how to harness Deep Convolutional Neural Net-
works (DCNNs) for 3D shape and texture reconstruction.
The ﬁrst such methods either trained regression DCNNs
from image to the parameters of a 3DMM [39] or used
a 3DMM to synthesize images [28, 18] and formulate an
image-to-image translation problem using DCNNs to es-
timate the depth3 [34]. The more recent unsupervised
DCNN-based methods are trained to regress 3DMM param-
eters from identity features by making use of differentiable
image formation architectures [9] and differentiable render-
ers [16, 37, 29].

The most recent methods such as [36, 40, 14] use both
the 3DMM model, as well as additional network structures
(called correctives) in order to extend the shape and texture
representation. Even though the paper [36] shows that the
reconstructed facial texture has indeed more details than a
texture estimated from a 3DMM [39, 37], it is still unable to
capture high-frequency details in texture and subsequently
many identity characteristics (please see the Fig. 4). Fur-
thermore, because the method permits the reconstructions
to be outside the 3DMM space, it is susceptible to outliers
(e.g., glasses etc.) which are baked in shape and texture. Al-
though rendering networks (i.e. trained by VAE [25]) gen-
erates outstanding quality textures, each network is capable
of storing up to few individuals whom should be placed in a

ing the normals by using image features.

controlled environment to collect ∼20 millions of images.
In this paper, we still propose to build upon the success
of DCNNs but take a radically different approach for 3D
shape and texture reconstruction from a single in-the-wild
image. That is, instead of formulating regression method-
ologies or auto-encoder structures that make use of self-
supervision [36, 16, 40], we revisit the optimization-based
3DMM ﬁtting approach by the supervision of deep iden-
tity features and by using Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) as our statistical parametric representation of the
facial texture.

In particular, the novelties that this paper brings are:

• We show for the ﬁrst time, to the best of our knowl-
edge, that a large-scale high-resolution statistical re-
construction of the complete facial surface on an un-
wrapped UV space can be successfully used for recon-
struction of arbitrary facial textures even captured in
unconstrained recording conditions4.

• We formulate a novel 3DMM ﬁtting strategy which is

based on GANs and a differentiable renderer.

• We devise a novel cost function which combines vari-
ous content losses on deep identity features from a face
recognition network.

• We demonstrate excellent facial shape and texture re-
constructions in arbitrary recording conditions that are
shown to be both photorealistic and identity preserving
in qualitative and quantitative experiments.

2. History of 3DMM Fitting

Our methodology naturally extends and generalizes the
ideas of texture and shape 3DMM using modern methods
for representing texture using GANs, as well as deﬁnes loss
functions using differentiable renderers and very powerful
publicly available face recognition networks [12]. Before
we deﬁne our cost function, we will brieﬂy outline the his-
tory of 3DMM representation and ﬁtting.

2.1. 3DMM representation

The ﬁrst step is to establish dense correspondences be-
tween the training 3D facial meshes and a chosen template
with ﬁxed topology in terms of vertices and triangulation.

2.1.1 Texture

Traditionally 3DMMs use a UV map for representing tex-
ture. UV maps help us to assign 3D texture data into 2D

4In the very recent works, it was shown that it is feasible to reconstruct
the non-visible parts a UV space for facial texture completion[11] and that
GANs can be used to generate novel high-resolution faces[35]. Neverthe-
less, our work is the ﬁrst one that demonstrates that a GAN can be used
as powerful statistical texture prior and reconstruct the complete texture of
arbitrary facial images.

Figure 2: Detailed overview of the proposed approach. A 3D face reconstruction is rendered by a differentiable renderer
(shown in purple). Cost functions are mainly formulated by means of identity features on a pretrained face recognition
network (shown in gray) and they are optimized by ﬂowing the error all the way back to the latent parameters (ps, pe, pt, c, i,
shown in green) with gradient descent optimization. End-to-end differentiable architecture enables us to use computationally
cheap and reliable ﬁrst order derivatives for optimization thus making it possible to employ deep networks as a generator
(i.e,. statistical model) or as a cost function.

planes with universal per-pixel alignment for all textures. A
commonly used UV map is built by cylindrical unwrapping
the mean shape into a 2D ﬂat space formulation, which we
use to create an RGB image IU V . Each vertex in the 3D
space has a texture coordinate tcoord in the UV image plane
in which the texture information is stored. A universal func-
tion exists, where for each vertex we can sample the texture
information from the UV space as T = P(IU V , tcoord).

In order to deﬁne a statistical texture representation, all
the training texture UV maps are vectorized and Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. Under this model
any test texture T0 is approximated as a linear combination
of the mean texture mt and a set of bases Ut as follows:

T(pt) ≈ mt + Utpt

(1)

where pt is the texture parameters for the text sample T0.
In the early 3DMM studies, the statistical model of the tex-
ture was built with few faces captured in strictly controlled
conditions and was used to reconstruct the test albedo of
the face. Since, such texture models can hardly represent
faces captured in uncontrolled recording conditions (in-the-
wild). Recently it was proposed to use statistical models
of hand-crafted features such as SIFT or HoG [6] directly
from in-the-wild faces. The interested reader is referred to
[5, 30] for more details on texture models used in 3DMM
ﬁtting algorithms.

The recent 3D face ﬁtting methods [36, 40, 14] still make
use of similar statistical models for the texture. Hence, they
can naturally represent only the low-frequency components
of the facial texture (please see Fig. 4).

The method of choice for building statistical models of fa-
cial or head 3D shapes is still PCA [22]. Assuming that the
3D shapes in correspondence comprise of N vertexes, i.e.
s = (cid:2)xT
In
order to represent both variations in terms of identity and
expression, generally two linear models are used. The ﬁrst
is learned from facial scans displaying the neutral expres-
sion (i.e., representing identity variations) and the second
is learned from displacement vectors (i.e., representing ex-
pression variations). Then a test facial shape S(ps,e) can be
written as

.

S(ps,e) ≈ ms,e + Us,eps,e

(2)

where ms,e in the mean shape vector, Us,e ∈ R3N ×ns,e
is Us,e = [Us, Ue] where the Us are the bases that cor-
respond to identity variations, and Ue the bases that cor-
respond to expression. Finally, ps,e are the ns,e shape pa-
rameters which can be split accordingly to the identity and
expression bases: ps,e = [ps, pe].

Fitting

3. Approach

3D face and texture reconstruction by ﬁtting a 3DMM
is performed by solving a non-linear energy based cost op-
timization problem that recovers a set of parameters p =
[ps,e, pt, pc, pl] where pc are the parameters related to a
camera model and pl are the parameters related to an illu-
mination model. The optimization can be formulated as:

min

p

E(p) = ||I0(p) − W(p)||2

2 + Reg({ps,e, pt})

(3)

where I0 is the test image to be ﬁtted and W is a vector
produced by a physical image formation process (i.e., ren-
dering) controlled by p. Finally, Reg is the regularization
term that is mainly related to texture and shape parameters.
Various methods have been proposed for numerical op-
timization of the above cost functions [19, 2]. A notable
recent approach is [6] which uses handcrafted features (i.e.,
H) for texture representation simpliﬁed the cost function as:

min
pr

E(pr) = ||H(I0(pr))−H(W(pr))||2

A+Reg(ps,e) (4)

A = aT Aa, A is the orthogonal space to the
where ||a||2
statistical model of the texture and pr is the set of reduced
parameters pr = {ps,e, pc}. The optimization problem in
Eq. 4 is solved by Gauss-Newton method. The main draw-
back of this method is that the facial texture in not recon-
structed.

In this paper, we generalize the 3DMM ﬁttings and in-

troduce the following novelties:

• We use a GAN on high-resolution UV maps as our sta-
tistical representation of the facial texture. That way
we can reconstruct textures with high-frequency de-
tails.

• Instead of other cost functions used in the literature
such as low-level ℓ1 or ℓ2 loss (e.g., RGB values [27],
edges [31]) or hand-crafted features (e.g., SIFT [6]),
we propose a novel cost function that is based on fea-
ture loss from the various layers of publicly available
face recognition embedding network [12]. Unlike oth-
ers, deep identity features are very powerful at preserv-
ing identity characteristics of the input image.

• We replace physical image formation stage with a dif-
ferentiable renderer to make use of ﬁrst order deriva-
tives (i.e., gradient descent). Unlike its alternatives,
gradient descent provides computationally cheaper and
more reliable derivatives through such deep architec-
tures (i.e., above-mentioned texture GAN and identity
DCNN).

We propose an optimization-based 3D face reconstruc-
tion approach from a single image that employs a high ﬁ-
delity texture generation network as statistical prior as il-
lustrated in Fig. 2. To this end, the reconstruction mesh
is formed by 3D morphable shape model; textured by the
generator network’s output UV map; and projected into 2D
image by a differentiable renderer. The distance between
the rendered image and the input image is minimized in
terms of a number of cost functions by updating the latent
parameters of 3DMM and the texture network with gradi-
ent descent. We mainly formulate these functions based on
rich features of face recognition network [12, 33, 26] for
smoother convergence and landmark detection network [13]
for alignment and rough shape estimation.

The following sections introduce ﬁrstly our novel texture
model that employs a generator network trained by progres-
sive growing GAN framework. After describing the proce-
dure for image formation with differentiable renderer, we
formulate our cost functions and the procedure for ﬁtting
our shape and texture models onto a test image.

3.1. GAN Texture Model

Although conventional PCA is powerful enough to build
a decent shape and texture model, it is often unable to cap-
ture high frequency details and ends up having blurry tex-
tures due to its Gaussian nature. This becomes more appar-
ent in texture modelling which is a key component in 3D
reconstruction to preserve identity as well as photo-realism.
GANs are shown to be very effective at capturing such
details. However,
they suffer from preserving 3D co-
herency [17] of the target distribution when the training im-
ages are semi-aligned. We found that a GAN trained with
UV representation of real textures with per pixel alignment
avoids this problem and is able to generate realistic and co-
herent UVs from 99.9% of its latent space while at the same
time generalizing well to unseen data.

In order to take advantage of this perfect harmony, we
train a progressive growing GAN [23] to model distribu-
tion of UV representations of 10,000 high resolution tex-
tures and use the trained generator network

G(pt) : R512 → RH×W ×C

(5)

as texture model that replaces 3DMM texture model in
Eq. 1.

While ﬁtting with linear models, i.e. 3DMM, is as sim-
ple as linear transformation, ﬁtting with a generator net-
work can be formulated as an optimization that minimizes
per-pixel Manhattan distance between target texture in UV
space Iuv and the network output G(pt) with respect to the
latent parameter pt, i.e. minpt |G(pt) − Iuv|.

3.2. Differentiable Renderer

Following [16], we employ a differentiable renderer to
project 3D reconstruction into a 2D image plane based on
deferred shading model with given camera and illumination
parameters. Since color and normal attributes at each vertex
are interpolated at the corresponding pixels with barycen-
tric coordinates, gradients can be easily backpropagated
through the renderer to the latent parameters.

A 3D textured mesh at the center of Cartesian origin
[0, 0, 0] is projected onto 2D image plane by a pinhole cam-
era model with the camera standing at [xc, yc, zc], directed
towards [x′
c] and with the focal length fc. The il-
lumination is modelled by phong shading given 1) direct
light source at 3D coordinates [xl, yl, zl] with color values
[rl, gl, bl], and 2) color of ambient lighting [ra, ga, ba].

many other tasks including novel identity synthesizing [15],
face normalization [9] and 3D face reconstruction [16]. In
our approach, we take advantage of an off-the-shelf state-
of-the-art face recognition network [12]5 in order to capture
identity related features of an input face image and optimize
the latent parameters accordingly. More speciﬁcally, given a
pretrained face recognition network F n(I) : RH×W ×C →
R512 consisting of n convolutional ﬁlters, we calculate the
cosine distance between the identity features (i.e., embed-
dings) of the real target image and our rendered images as
following:

Lid = 1 −

F n(I0).F n(IR)

||F n(I0)||2||F n(IR)||2

(8)

We formulate an additional identity loss on the rendered im-
age ˆIR that is rendered with random pose, expression and
lighting. This loss ensures that our reconstruction resembles
the target identity under different conditions. We formulate
it by replacing IR by ˆIR in Eq. 8 and it is denoted as ˆLid.

IR = R(S(ps, pe), P(G(pt)), pc, pl)

(6)

3.3.2 Content Loss

where we construct shape mesh by 3DMM as given in Eq. 2
and texture by GAN generator network as in Eq. 5. Since
our differentiable renderer supports only color vectors, we
sample from our generated UV map to get vectorized color
representation as explained in Sec. 2.1.1.

Additionally, we render a secondary image with random
expression, pose and illumination in order to generalize
identity related parameters well with those variations. We
sample expression parameters from a normal distribution as
ˆpe ∼ N (µ = 0, σ = 0.5) and sample camera and illumina-
tion parameters from the Gaussian distribution of 300W-3D
dataset as ˆpc ∼ N ( ˆµc, ˆσc) and ˆpl ∼ N ( ˆµl, ˆσl). This ren-
dered image of the same identity as IR (i.e., with same ps
and pt parameters) is expressed by the following:

ˆIR = R(S(ps, ˆpe), P(G(pt)), ˆpc, ˆpl)

(7)

3.3. Cost Functions

Given an input image I0, we optimize all of the afore-
mentioned parameters simultaneously with gradient descent
updates. In each iteration, we simply calculate the forth-
coming cost terms for the current state of the 3D recon-
struction, and take the derivative of the weighted error with
respect to the parameters using backpropagation.

3.3.1

Identity Loss

With the availability of large scale datasets, CNNs have
shown incredible performance on many face recognition
benchmarks. Their strong identity features are robust to
many variations including pose, expression, illumination,
age etc. These features are shown to be quite effective at

Face recognition networks are trained to remove all kinds
of attributes (e.g. expression, illumination, age, pose) other
than abstract identity information throughout the convolu-
tional layers. Despite their strength, the activations in the
very last layer discard some of the mid-level features that
are useful for 3D reconstruction, e.g. variations that depend
on age. Therefore we found it effective to accompany iden-
tity loss by leveraging intermediate representations in the
face recognition network that are still robust to pixel-level
deformations and not too abstract to miss some details. To
this end, normalized euclidean distance of intermediate ac-
tivations, namely content loss, is minimized between input
and rendered image with the following loss term:

Lcon =

n

X

j

||F j(I0) − F j(IR)||2
HF j × WF j × CF j

(9)

3.3.3 Pixel Loss

While identity and content loss terms optimize albedo of
the visible texture, lighting conditions are optimized based
on pixel value difference directly. While this cost function
is relatively primitive, it is sufﬁcient to optimize lighting
parameters such as ambient colors, direction, distance and
color of a light source. We found that optimizing illumina-
tion parameters jointly with others helped to improve albedo
of the recovered texture. Furthermore, pixel loss support
identity and content loss with ﬁne-grained texture as it sup-
ports highest available resolution while images needs to be

5We empirically deduced that other face recognition networks work
almost equally well and this choice is orthogonal to the proposed approach.

1159

Figure 3: Example ﬁts of our approach for the images from various datasets. Please note that our ﬁtting approach is robust
to occlusion (e.g., glasses), low resolution and black-white in the photos and generalizes well with ethnicity, gender and
age. The reconstructed textures are very well at capturing high frequency details of the identities; likewise, the reconstructed
geometries from 3DMM are surprisingly good at identity preservation thanks to the identity features used, e.g. crooked nose
at bottom-left, dull eyes at bottom-right and chin dimple at top-left

downscaled to 112 × 112 before identity and content loss.
The pixel loss is deﬁned by pixel level ℓ1 loss function as:

onto input image and is formulated as following:

Llan = ||M(I0) − M(IR)||2

(11)

Lpix = ||I0 − IR||1

(10)

3.4. Model Fitting

3.3.4 Landmark Loss

The face recognition network F is pre-trained by the im-
ages that are aligned by similarity transformation to a ﬁxed
landmark template. To be compatible with the network, we
align the input and rendered images under the same settings.
However, this process disregards the aspect ratio and scale
of the reconstruction. Therefore, we employ a deep face
alignment network [13] M(I) : RH×W ×C → R68×2 to
detect landmark locations of the input image and align the
rendered geometry onto it by updating the shape, expression
and camera parameters. That is, camera parameters are op-
timized to align with the pose of image I and geometry pa-
rameters are optimized for the rough shape estimation. As
a natural consequence, this alignment drastically improves
the effectiveness of the pixel and content loss, which are
sensitive to misalignment between the two images.

The alignment error is achieved by point-to-point eu-
clidean distances between detected landmark locations of
the input image and 2D projection of the 3D reconstruc-
tion landmark locations that is available as meta-data of the
shape model. Since landmark locations of the reconstruc-
tion heavily depend on camera parameters, this loss is great
a source of information the alignment of the reconstruction

We ﬁrst roughly align our reconstruction to the input im-
age by optimizing shape, expression and camera parame-
ters by: minpr E(pr) = λlanLlan. We then simultaneously
optimize all of our parameters with gradient descent and
backpropagation so as to minimize weighted combination
of above loss terms in the following:

E(p) = λidLid + ˆλid ˆLid + λconLcon +λpixLpix

min

p

+λlanLlan + λregReg({ps,e, pl})

(12)
where we weight each of our loss terms with λ parame-
ters.
In order to prevent our shape and expression mod-
els and lighting parameters from exaggeration to arbitrar-
ily bias our loss terms, we regularize those parameters by
Reg({ps,e, pl}).

Fitting with Multiple Images (i.e. Video): While the
proposed approach can ﬁt a 3D reconstruction from a single
image, one can take advantage of more images effectively
when available, e.g.
from a video recording. This often
helps to improve reconstruction quality under challenging
conditions, e.g. outdoor, low resolution. While state-of-
the-art methods follow naive approaches by averaging ei-
ther the reconstruction [39] or features-to-be-regressed [16]

4. Experiments

This section demonstrates the excellent performance of
the proposed approach for 3D face reconstruction and shape
recovery. We verify this by qualitative results in Fig-
ures 1, 3, qualitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art
in Sec. 4.2 and quantitative shape reconstruction experiment
on a database with ground truth in Sec. 4.3.

4.1. Implementation Details

For all of our experiments, a given face image is aligned
to our ﬁxed template using 68 landmark locations detected
by an hourglass 2D landmark detection [13]. For the iden-
tity features, we employ ArcFace [12] network’s pretrained
models. For the generator network G, we train a progres-
sive growing GAN [23] with around 10,000 UV maps from
[7] at the resolution of 512 × 512. We use the Large Scale
Face Model [7] for 3DMM shape model with ns = 158
and the expression model learned from 4DFAB database [8]
with ne = 29. During ﬁtting process, we optimize pa-
rameters using Adam Solver [24] with 0.01 learning rate.
And we set our balancing factors as the following: λid :
2.0, ˆλid : 2.0, λcon : 50.0, λpix : 1.0, λlan : 0.001, λreg :
{0.05, 0.01}. The Fitting converges in around 30 seconds
on an Nvidia GTX 1080 TI GPU for a single image.

Fig. 4 compares our results with the most recent face
reconstruction studies [37, 36, 16, 39, 40] on a subset of
MoFA test-set. The ﬁrst four rows after input images show
a comparison of our shape and texture reconstructions to
[16, 39, 36] and the last three rows show our reconstructed
geometries without texture compared to [36, 40]. All in all,
our method outshines all others with its high ﬁdelity pho-
torealistic texture reconstructions. Both of our texture and
shape reconstructions manifest strong identity characteris-
tics of the corresponding input images from the thickness
and shape of the eyebrows to wrinkles around the mouth

We evaluate the shape reconstruction performance of our
method on MICC Florence 3D Faces dataset (MICC) [1] in
Table 1. The dataset provides 3D scans of 53 subjects as
well as their short video footages under three difﬁculty set-
tings: ’cooperative’, ’indoor’ and ’outdoor’. Unlike [16, 39]
which processes all the frames in a video, we uniformly
sample only 5 frames from each video regardless of their
zoom level. And, we run our method with multi-image sup-
port for these 5 frames for each video separately as shown
in Eq. 13. Each test mesh is cropped at a radius of 95mm
around the tip of the nose according to [39] in order to eval-
uate the shape recovery of the inner facial mesh. We per-
form dense alignment between each predicted mesh and its
corresponding ground truth mesh, by implementing an iter-
ative closest point (ICP) method [3]. As evaluation metric,
we follow [16] to measure the error by average symetric
point-to-plane distance.

Table 1 reports the normalized point-to-plain errors in
millimeters. It is evident that we have improved the abso-
lute error compared to the other two state-of-the-art meth-
ods by 36%. Our results are shown to be consistent across
all different settings with minimal standard deviation from
the mean error.

4.4. Ablation Study

Fig. 5 shows an ablation study on our method where the
full model reconstructs the input face better than its variants,

(a) I0

(b) IR

(c) IR albedo

(d) IR \ Lid

(e) IR \ ˆLid

(f) IR \ Lcon

(g) IR \ Lpix

(h)IR\{Lid,

ˆLid,Lcon} (i) IR with T(pt)

the proposed approach with an leave-one-out ablation study.

something that suggests that each of our components signif-
icantly contributes towards a good reconstruction. Fig. 5(c)
indicates albedo is well disentangled from illumination and
our model capture the light direction accurately.

While Fig. 5(d-f) shows each of the identity terms con-
tributes to preserve identity, Fig. 5(h) demonstrates the sig-
niﬁcance identity features altogether. Still, overall recon-
struction utilizes pixel intensities to capture better albedo
and illumination as shown in Fig. 5(g). Finally, Fig. 5(i)
shows the superiority of our textures over PCA-based ones.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we revisit optimization-based 3D face re-
construction under a new perspective, that is, we utilize the
power of recent machine learning techniques such as GANs
and face recognition network as statistical texture model
and as energy function respectively.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that
GANs are used for model ﬁtting and they have shown excel-
lent results for high quality texture reconstruction. The pro-
posed approach shows identity preserving high ﬁdelity 3D
reconstructions in qualitative and quantitative experiments.
