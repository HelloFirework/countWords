Abstract

This paper presents a new neural network for enhanc-
ing underexposed photos.
Instead of directly learning an
image-to-image mapping as previous work, we introduce
intermediate illumination in our network to associate the
input with expected enhancement result, which augments
the network’s capability to learn complex photographic ad-
justment from expert-retouched input/output image pairs.
Based on this model, we formulate a loss function that
adopts constraints and priors on the illumination, prepare
a new dataset of 3,000 underexposed image pairs, and train
the network to effectively learn a rich variety of adjustment
for diverse lighting conditions. By these means, our net-
work is able to recover clear details, distinct contrast, and
natural color in the enhancement results. We perform ex-
tensive experiments on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK
dataset and our new dataset, and show that our network
is effective to deal with previously challenging images.

1. Introduction

Photo sharing on social networks is very common due
to the readily-available cameras on various devices, partic-
ularly the cell phones. However, the captured photo could
get underexposed due to low- and back-lighting; see Fig-
ure 1(a) for an example. Such photos not only look un-
pleasing and fail to capture what the user desires, but also
challenge many fundamental computer vision tasks, such
as segmentation, object detection and tracking, since the
underexposed regions have barely-visible details and rela-
tively low contrast, as well as dull colors.

Severely-underexposed photo enhancement is a chal-
lenging task, since the underexposed regions are usually
imperceptible and the enhancement process is highly non-
linear and subjective. Although software exists to allow
users to interactively adjust photos, it is rather tedious and
difﬁcult for non-experts since it requires to simultaneously
manipulate controls like color and contrast, while ﬁnely
tuning various objects and details in the photos. Several

recent tools provide an automated function for users to en-
hance photos by just a single click, e.g., “Auto Enhance”
on iPhone and “Auto Tone” in Lightroom. These tools do
not greatly alter image contrast (and exposure) and may fail
on severely underexposed images due to the inherent difﬁ-
culty of automatically balancing assorted factors in the ad-
justment; see Figure 1.

On the other hand, various methods were proposed in
the research community to tackle the problem. Early
work [34, 25, 32, 11, 26, 4] primarily focuses on contrast
enhancement, which may not be sufﬁcient to recover image
details and color. More recent work [16, 17, 13, 9, 15, 22]
takes data-driven approaches to simultaneously learn ad-
justment in terms of color, contrast, brightness, and satu-
ration for producing more expressive results. We note that
existing methods still have their respective limitations on
severely underexposed images; see Figure 2.

This paper presents a new end-to-end network for en-
hancing underexposed photos. Particularly, instead of di-
rectly learning an image-to-image mapping, we design our
network to ﬁrst estimate an image-to-illumination mapping

for modeling varying-lighting conditions and then take the
illumination map to light up the underexposed photo. By
this approach, we make the learning process effective and
infer a rich variety of photographic adjustment. Further, we
adopt bilateral-grid-based upsampling to reduce the compu-
tational cost, and design a loss function that adopts various
constraints and priors on illumination, so that we can efﬁ-
ciently recover underexposed photos with natural exposure,
proper contrast, clear details, and vivid color. We also pre-
pare a new dataset of 3,000 underexposed photos that cover
diverse lighting conditions to supplement existing bench-
mark data. Below, we summarize the major contributions
of this work.

• We propose a network for enhancing underexposed
photos by estimating an image-to-illumination map-
ping, and design a new loss function based on various
illumination constraints and priors.

• We prepare a new dataset of 3,000 underexposed im-

ages, each with an expert-retouched reference.

• We perform evaluation on our method using existing
and new datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of
our method qualitatively and quantitatively.

2. Related Work

Photo enhancement has a long history in computer vi-
sion and image processing. One pioneering method is the
famous histogram equalization, which expands the dynamic
range and increases image contrast. Its limitation is obvious
with the globally adjusted contrast in the entire image.

Retinex-based Methods Assuming that an image can be
decomposed into pixel-wise product of reﬂectance and il-
lumination (or shading), Retinex-based methods [19] treat

the reﬂectance component as a plausible approximation to
the enhanced image. Hence, photo enhancement can be for-
mulated as an illumination estimation problem, where il-
lumination is estimated to enhance the underexposed pho-
tos [27, 11, 31, 14, 4, 33]. However, due to the nonlinearity
across color channels and data complexity, existing meth-
ods have limited capability to enhance color, since color
is easily distorted locally. Our work also considers illu-
mination estimation and yet it advances state of the arts in
two aspects. First, the neural network learns the illumina-
tion by exploiting massive photos in diverse lighting condi-
tions and models a rich variety of photographic adjustment.
Second, our approach enables nonlinear color enhancement
from multi-channel illumination.

Learning-based Methods Recent effort on photo en-
hancement is mostly learning-based. For instance, By-
chkovsky et al. [3] provided the ﬁrst and largest dataset
MIT-Adobe FiveK with input and expert-retouched im-
age pairs for tone adjustment. Yan et al. [28] presented
a machine-learned ranking approach for automatically en-
hancing color in a photograph. Yan et al. [29] constructed
the semantic map to achieve semantic-aware photo en-
hancement. Lore et al. [21] proposed a deep autoencoder-
based approach for low-light image enhancement, while
Gharbi et al. [13] introduced bilateral learning for real-time
performance. Yang et al. [30] corrected the LDR images us-
ing a deep reciprocating HDR transformation. Cai et al. [5]
learned a contrast enhancer from multi-exposure images.
Recently, Chen et al. [9] developed an unpaired learning
model for photo enhancement based on a two-way genera-
tive adversarial networks (GANs), while Ignatov et al. [18]
designed a weakly-supervised image-to-image GAN-based
network. Further, Deng et al. [10] enabled aesthetic-driven

directly on raw sensor data with a new dataset.

petence in modeling color enhancement, especially for han-
dling the nonlinearity across different color channels.

Reinforcement learning was also employed to enhance
the image adjustment process [15, 22]. Our approach is
complementary to existing learning-based methods in two
ways. First, we estimate the illumination mapping, unlike
others that are based on image-to-image regression. Sec-
ond, our new dataset exactly suits underexposed photo en-
hancement, which supplements other benchmark datasets
and provides more real-world examples in diverse lighting
conditions.

3. Methodology

3.1. Image Enhancement Model

Fundamentally, the image enhancement task can be re-
garded as seeking a mapping function F , such that ˜I =
F(I) is the desired image, enhanced from input image I. In
recent Retinex-based image enhancement methods [11, 14],
the inverse of F is typically modeled as an illumination map
S, which multiplies with the reﬂectance image ˜I in a pixel-
wise manner to produce the observed image I:

I = S ∗ ˜I ,

(1)

where ∗ denotes a pixel-wise multiplication.

Similar to that of [11, 14], we also regard the reﬂectance
component ˜I as a well-exposed image, so in our model, we
take ˜I as the enhancement result and I as the observed un-
derexposed image. Once S is known, we can obtain the
enhancement result ˜I by F(I) = S−1 ∗ I. Unlike exist-
ing work [11, 14], we model S as a multi-channel (R, G,

Why this Model Works? By introducing intermediate il-
lumination in our network, we train the network to learn
an image-to-illumination (instead of image-to-image) map-
ping. The key advantage is that illumination maps for
natural images typically have relatively simple forms with
known priors. So the network can have stronger general-
ization capability and be trained effectively to learn com-
plex photographic adjustment for diverse lighting condi-
tions. In addition, the model enables customizing the en-
hancement results by formulating constraints on illumina-
tion. For instance, contrast can be enhanced by enforcing
locally smooth illumination, or setting the preferred expo-
sure level by constraining illumination magnitudes.

3.2. Network Architecture

Figure 3 presents the pipeline of our network, with the
two major advantages of effective learning of the illumina-
tion mapping and efﬁcient network computation.

Effective Learning Enhancing underexposed photos re-
quires adjusting both local (e.g., contrast, detail sharpness,
shadow, and highlight) and global features (e.g., color dis-
tribution, average brightness, and scene category). We con-
sider local and global context from the features generated
from an encoder network; see Figure 3 (top). To drive
the network to learn the illumination mapping from the
input underexposed image (Ii) and corresponding expert-
retouched image ( ˜Ii), we design a loss function, with a
smoothness prior on the illumination and a reconstruction

and color loss on the enhanced image; see Figure 3 (bot-
tom). These strategies effectively learn S from (Ii, ˜Ii) for
recovering the enhanced image with a rich variety of photo-
graphic adjustment.

Efﬁcient Runtime We learn the local and global fea-
tures for predicting the image-to-illumination mapping in
low resolution, and perform bilateral grid based upsam-
pling [8, 7, 12, 13] to enlarge the low-res prediction to the
full resolution; see Figure 3. Hence, most network com-
putation is done in low-res domain, enabling real-time pro-
cessing of high-resolution images.

3.3. Loss Function

We learn the illumination mapping from a set of N im-
age pairs {(Ii, ˜Ii)}N
i=1. It produces S and the enhancement
result F(I) = S−1 ∗ I. We design a loss function L that
consists of three components and minimize it during the net-
work training. It is expressed as

beyond the gamut, whereas setting 1 as S’s upper bound
avoids mistakenly darkening the underexposed regions.

Figure 4 presents ablation study results that demonstrate
the effect of various components in the loss function. Com-
paring the 2nd and 3rd images in the ﬁgure, we observe
clearer details and better contrast in the result by minimiz-
ing the reconstruction loss.
It has clear advantages over
naive image-to-image regression, where the latter directly
regresses the output image without estimating the interme-
diate illumination in our network (see Figure 3). While im-
ages enhanced with the reconstruction loss look more sim-
ilar to the expert-retouched ones, there is still risk of not
producing correct contrast details and vivid color(the 3rd
and 6th images in Figure 4). Hence, we also introduce the
smoothness and color loss.

Smoothness Loss According to the smoothness prior [23,
20, 2], illumination in natural images is in general locally
smooth. Adopting this prior in our network has two ad-
vantages. First, it helps reduce over-ﬁtting and increase the
network’s generalization capability. Second, it enhances the
image contrast. When adjacent pixels p and q have similar
illumination values, their contrast in the enhanced image
can be estimated as | ˜Ip − ˜Iq| ≈ S−1
∗ |Ip − Iq|, which
should also be enlarged, since S ≤ 1. Therefore, we deﬁne
the smoothness loss on the predicted full resolution illumi-
nation S in Figure 3 as

p

Reconstruction Loss To obtain the predicted illumina-
tion S, we deﬁne the L2 error metric to measure the re-
construction error as

where all pixel channels in Ii and ˜Ii are normalized

(Ii)c ≤ (S)c ≤ 1 is the multi-channel illumination range

bound ensures all color channels in the enhancement re-
sult F(Ii) are (upper) bounded by one, thus avoiding colors

gradients; and ǫ is a small constant typically set to 0.0001,
preventing division by zero.

Intuitively, the smoothness loss encourages the illumina-
tion to be smooth on pixels with small gradients and dis-
continuous on pixels with large gradients. It is intriguing
to note that for underexposed photos, image content and
details are often weak. Large gradients are more likely in-
curred by inconsistent illumination. As demonstrated by the
4th image in Figure 4, by further incorporating the smooth-
ness loss, we recover decent image contrast and clearer de-
tails compared with the results produced with only the re-
construction loss.

Color Loss Next, we formulate the color loss to encour-
age the color in the generated image F(Ii) of Ii to match
that in the corresponding expert-retouched image ˜Ii as

(around 4%) of underexposed images. Second, the underex-
posed images in the benchmark dataset cover limited light-
ing conditions; it lacks challenging cases such as nighttime
images and images with non-uniform illumination.

To prepare our dataset, we ﬁrst capture images in the
resolution of 6000 × 4000 using Canon EOS 5D Mark III
and Sony ILCE-7, and further collected around 15% more
images from Flickr by searching with keywords “under-
exposed”, “low-light”, and “backlit”. Then, we recruited
three experts from the school of photography to prepare a
retouched reference image for each collected image using
Adobe Lightroom. Our dataset is diverse; it covers a broad
range of lighting conditions, scenes, subjects, and styles.
Please see Figure 5 for some of the image pairs. Finally, we
randomly split the images in the dataset into two subsets:
2,750 images for training and the rest for testing.

3.5. Implementation Details

where ()p denotes a pixel; ∠(, ) is an operator that calcu-
lates the angle between two colors regarding the RGB color
as a 3D vector. Eq. (6) sums the angles between the color
vectors for every pixel pair in F(Ii) and ˜Ii.

The reasons that we use this simple formulation instead
of an L2 distance in other color space are as follows. First,
the reconstruction loss has already implicitly measured the
L2 color difference. Second, since the L2 metric only nu-
merically measures the color difference, it cannot ensure
that the color vectors have the same direction. Therefore,
the metric may induce evident color mismatch. This can
be observed by comparing the 4th and 5th results with and
without the color loss in Figure 4. Last but not least, the
formulation is simple and fast for network computation.

We build our network on TensorFlow [1] and train it
for 40 epochs with a mini-batch size of 16 on an NVidia
Titan X Pascal GPU. The entire network is optimized us-
ing the Adam optimizer with a ﬁxed learning rate of 10−4.
For data augmentation, we randomly cropped 512 × 512
patches followed by random mirror, resize and rotation for
all patches. The downsampled input has a ﬁxed resolu-
tion of 256 × 256. The encoder network is a pre-trained
VGG16 [24]. The local feature extractor contains two con-
volution layers, while the global feature extractor contains
two convolution layers and three fully-connected layers.
Further, we use the bilateral grid-based module [13] to up-
sample the output. Our code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/wangruixing/DeepUPE.

4. Experimental Results

We prepared a new dataset of 3,000 images. We
trained our network on it instead of the MIT-Adobe FiveK
dataset [3] for two reasons. First, the FiveK dataset was
created primarily for enhancing general photos rather than
underexposed photos; it contains only a very small portion

Datasets We evaluated our network on (i) our dataset and
(ii) the MIT-Adobe FiveK [3] dataset with 5,000 raw im-
ages, each with ﬁve retouched images produced by different
experts (A/B/C/D/E). For the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, we
follow previous methods [13, 15, 22] to use only the output

and testing, and trained on the remaining 4,500 images.

Evaluation Metrics We employed two commonly-used
metrics (i.e., PSNR and SSIM) to quantitatively evaluate the
performance of our network in terms of the color and struc-
ture similarity between the predicted results and the corre-
sponding expert-retouched images. Although it is not abso-
lutely indicative, in general, high PSNR and SSIM values
correspond to reasonably good results.

4.1. Comparison with State of the art Methods

We compare our method with the following ﬁve state-of-
the-art image enhancement methods: (i) the latest Retinex-
based method, JieP [4], and (ii)-(v) four recent deep-
learning-based methods of HDRNet [13], DPE [9], White-

Box [15], and Distort-and-Recover [22]. For fair compar-
ison, we produce their results using publicly-available im-
plementation provided by the authors with recommended
parameter setting. For the four learning-based methods, we
further re-train their models on our dataset and also on the
MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset to produce the best possible re-
sults. Our comparison is threefold.

Visual Comparison First, we show visual comparison in
Figures 6 and 7 on two challenging cases using an unevenly-
exposed photo with imperceptible windmill details (from
our dataset) and an overall low-light photo with little por-
trait details (from the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset). Com-
paring the results, we notice two key improvements of our
method (h) over the others (b)-(f). First, our method is
able to recover more details and better contrast in both

veals vivid and natural color, making the enhanced results
look more realistic. Please see the supplementary material
for more visual comparison results.

Quantitative Comparison To evaluate the learning ef-
fectiveness and generalization capability of our network, we
quantitatively compare it with the other methods using the
PSNR and SSIM metrics. Tables 1 and 2 report the results,
where for each case, we re-trained our network, as well as
others’, on respective datasets. Note that our loss function
without Lr, Ls, and Lc reduces to a pixel-wise L2 loss be-
tween corresponding image pairs in the dataset. Here, we
do not include JieP [4] because it is not a learning-based
method. For both comparisons, our method performs better,
manifesting that our method not only effectively learns the
photographic adjustment for enhancing the underexposed
photos but also well generalizes to the MIT-Adobe FiveK
dataset with a limited amount of underexposed photos.

User Study Further, we conducted a user study with 500
participants to compare results. Akin to that of [22], we ﬁrst
crawl 100 test images, which have over 50% pixels with in-
tensity lower than 0.3, from Flickr by searching with key-
words “city”, “ﬂower”, “food”, “landscape”, and “portrait”
(Figure 9 has an example). Then, we enhance each test im-
age using our method and others’, and recruit participants
via Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate each group of results,
which are presented in a random order to avoid subjective
bias.

For each result, the participants are asked to give a rating
for each of the six questions shown in Figure 8 using a Lik-
ert scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Figure 8 summarizes the
results, where each subﬁgure shows six rating distributions
of the methods on a particular question. The distribution
across methods shows that our results are more preferred
by human subjects, where our method receives more “red”
and far less “blue” ratings compared to the others. We also

having more loss components in our method, for both the
MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset and our dataset. They convinc-
ingly demonstrate the effectiveness of each loss component.

Limitations Figure 10 presents two examples where our
method, as well as other state-of-the-arts, all fail to pro-
duce visually compelling results. For the top image, we
fail to recover details on the horse body, since the region is
almost black without any trace of texture in the original im-
age, while for the bottom input, our method does not clear
noise in the enhancement result. Thus stronger denoising
ability will be our future goal.

5. Conclusion

We have presented a new end-to-end network for en-
hancing underexposed photos. Our key idea is to learn
an image-to-illumination (instead of image-to-image) map-
ping, so as to leverage the simplicity nature of illumina-
tion in natural images for the network to effectively learn
a rich variety of photographic adjustment. Further, we de-
sign a loss function that adopts various constraints and pri-
ors on illumination and create a new dataset of 3,000 under-
exposed image pairs, enabling our network to recover clear
details, distinct contrast, and vivid colors in underexposed
photos. We have performed extensive experiments on our
dataset and the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, and compared
our method with ﬁve state-of-the-art methods to show the
superiority of our solution in terms of visual comparison,
quantitative comparison in terms of the PSNR and SSIM
metrics, and a user study with 500 participants involved.

Our future work is to incorporate a denoising module
into our network and extend our method to handling videos.
Another direction is to address the nearly black regions by
leveraging techniques in scene semantic analysis and pho-
tographic image synthesis.

performed a statistical analysis on the ratings by conducting
paired t-test between our method and others. The result is
clear: all the t-test results are statistically signiﬁcant with
p < 0.01. Please see the supplementary material for more
details. Moreover, we extend the user study to compare also
with “Auto Enhance” on iPhone and “Auto Tone” in Light-
room. Results are also contained in the supplementary ma-
terial.

4.2. Discussions

Ablation Study Besides the visual results shown in Fig-
ure 4, we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the
components in our method. Comparing the statistics in the
last row (ours) and the 5th row (ours without all three losses)
in Tables 1 and 2, we observe clear advantage of our method
in learning an image-to-illumination mapping over a naive
image-to-image mapping. Moreover, the last four rows in
each table reveal progressive improvement on the results by
