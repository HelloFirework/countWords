Abstract

The question whether one can recover the shape of a
geometric object from its Laplacian spectrum (‘hear the
shape of the drum’) is a classical problem in spectral ge-
ometry with a broad range of implications and applica-
tions. While theoretically the answer to this question is neg-
ative (there exist examples of iso-spectral but non-isometric
manifolds), little is known about the practical possibility
of using the spectrum for shape reconstruction and opti-
mization. In this paper, we introduce a numerical proce-
dure called isospectralization, consisting of deforming one
shape to make its Laplacian spectrum match that of an-
other. We implement the isospectralization procedure using
modern differentiable programming techniques and exem-
plify its applications in some of the classical and notori-
ously hard problems in geometry processing, computer vi-
sion, and graphics such as shape reconstruction, pose and
style transfer, and dense deformable correspondence.

1. Introduction

Can one hear the shape of the drum? This classical
question in spectral geometry, made famous by Mark Kac’s
eponymous paper [21], inquires about the possibility of re-
covering the structure of a geometric object from its Lapla-
cian spectrum. Empirically, the relation between shape and
its acoustic properties has long been known and can be
traced back at least to medieval bellfounders. However,
while it is known that the spectrum carries many geomet-
ric and topological properties of the shape such as the area,
total curvature, number of connected components, etc., it
is now known that one cannot ‘hear’ the metric. Exam-
ples of high-dimensional manifolds that are isospectral but
not isometric have been constructed in 1964 [27] (predating
Kac’s paper), but it took until 1992 to produce a counter-
example of 2D polygons giving a negative answer to Kac’s

question [16, 15].

Nevertheless, the question of relation between shape and
spectrum is far from being closed, from both theoretical
and practical perspectives. Speciﬁcally, it is not yet certain
whether the counterexamples are the rule or the exception.
So far, everything points towards the latter. In fact, there
are known classes of manifolds in which the spectral recon-
struction is generically possible. See [39, 40, 41, 18] for
such results. Thus, it is plausible that the theoretical exis-
tence of rather ‘exotic’ counter-examples of non-isometric

isospectral manifolds does not preclude the possibility of
reconstructing the shape from its spectrum in practice.

This is exactly the direction explored in our paper. We
introduce a numerical procedure we call isospectralization,
which consists in deforming a mesh in order to align its
(ﬁnite) Laplacian spectrum with a given one. We imple-
ment this procedure using modern differentiable program-
ming tools used in deep learning applications and show its
usefulness in some of the fundamental problems in geome-
try processing, computer vision, and graphics.

For example, we argue that isospectralization (with some
additional priors such as smoothness and enclosed volume)
can in some cases be used to recover the structure of an
object from its spectrum, thus practically hearing the shape
of the drum (see Figure 1, top row).

Outside of the rare counterexamples, the reconstruction
is ambiguous up to intrinsic isometry. This ambiguity man-
ifests itself as a choice of an embedding of the mesh into
R3. This enables us to use the isospectralization procedure
to transfer style and pose across objects similarly to [11]:
we initialize with a source shape and apply isospectraliza-
tion to obtain the eigenvalues of the target shape; the result
is a shape in the pose of the source shape but with geometric
details of the target.

Even more remarkably, we show that pre-warping non-
isometric shapes by means of isospectralization can signiﬁ-
cantly help in solving the problem of ﬁnding intrinsic corre-
spondences between them (Figure 1, bottom row), suggest-
ing that our procedure could be a universal pre-processing
technique for general correspondence pipelines.

Contribution. We consider the shape-from-eigenvalues
problem and investigate its relevance in a selection of prob-
lems from computer vision and graphics. Our key contribu-
tions can be summarized as follows:

• Despite being highly non-linear and hard to compute,
we show for the ﬁrst time that the inverse mapping be-
tween a geometric domain and its Laplacian spectrum
is addressable with modern numerical tools;

• We propose the adoption of simple regularizers to
drive the spectrum alignment toward numerically op-
timal solutions;

• We showcase our method in the 2D and 3D settings,
and show applications of style transfer and dense map-
ping of non-isometric deformable shapes.

2. Related work

The possibility of reconstructing shape from spectrum is
of interest in theoretical physics [22], and has been explored
by theoreticians since the ’60s starting from Leon Green’s
question if a Riemannian manifold is fully determined by

its (complete) spectrum [6]. The isospectrality vs isometry
question received a negative answer in the seminal work of
Milnor [27], and additional counterexamples were provided
by Kac [21] and Gordon et al. [16] to name some classical
examples. A complete survey of the theoretical literature
on the topic is out of the scope of this paper; below, we
only consider the far less well-explored practical question
of how to realize metric embeddings from the sole knowl-
edge of the (ﬁnite) Laplacian eigenvalues.

A related but more general class of problems takes the
somewhat misleading name of inverse eigenvalue prob-
lems [13], dealing with the reconstruction of a generic phys-
ical system from prescribed spectral data. Different formu-
lations of the problem exist depending on the matrix repre-
sentation of the system; in the majority of cases, however, at
least partial knowledge of the eigenvectors is also assumed.
In the ﬁelds of computer vision and geometry process-
ing, Reuter et al. [32, 33] investigated the informativeness
of the Laplacian eigenvalues for the task of 3D shape re-
trieval. The authors proposed to employ the Laplacian
spectrum as a global shape signature (dubbed the ‘shape
DNA’), demonstrating good accuracy in distinguishing dif-
ferent shape classes. However, measuring the extent to
which eigenvalues carry geometric and topological infor-
mation about the shape was left as an open question.

More recently, there have been attempts at reconstructing
3D shapes from a full Laplacian matrix or other intrinsic op-
erators [11, 14]. Such methods differ from our approach in
that they leverage the complete information encoded in the
input operator matrix, while we only assume to be given the
operator’s eigenvalues as input. Further, these approaches
follow a two-step optimization process, in which the Rie-
mannian metric (edge lengths in the discrete case) is ﬁrst
reconstructed from the input matrix, and an embedding is
obtained in a second step. As we will show, we operate
“end-to-end” by solving directly for the ﬁnal embedding. It
is worthwhile to mention that the problem of reconstructing
a shape from its metric is considered a challenging problem
in itself [10, 12]. In computer graphics, several shape mod-
eling pipelines involve solving for an embedding under a
known mesh connectivity and additional extrinsic informa-
tion in the form of user-provided positional landmarks [35].
More closely related to our problem is the shape regis-
tration method of [17, 19]. The authors propose to solve
for a conformal rescaling of the metric of two given sur-
faces, so that the resulting eigenvalues align well. While
this approach shares with ours the overall objective of align-
ing spectra, the underlying assumption is for the Laplacian
matrices and geometric embeddings to be given. A simi-
lar approach was recently proposed in the conformal pre-
warping technique of [34] for shape correspondence using
functional maps.

A related, but different, inverse spectral problem has

7530

been tackled in [7]. There, the task is to optimize the shape
of metallophone keys to produce a desired sound when
struck in a speciﬁc place. Prescribing the sound consists
of prescribing a sparse selection of frequencies (eigenval-
ues) and the amplitudes to which the frequencies are excited
when the key is struck. It is also desirable that the other
frequencies be suppressed. This is different from the recon-
struction pursued in our work, since we prescribe a precise
sequence of eigenvalues. Further, amplitude suppression in
[7] is implemented by designing the nodal sets of speciﬁc
eigenfunctions, thus bringing this type of approach closer to
a partially described inverse eigenvalue problem [13, Chap-
ter 5].

Perhaps most closely related to our approach are meth-
ods that have explored the possibility of reconstructing
shapes from their spectrum in the case of coarsely trian-
gulated surfaces [1] and planar domains [31]. These works
also indicate that non-isometric isospectral shapes are ex-
ceedingly rare. Compared to the present paper, [1] and [31]
study shapes with a low number of degrees of freedom.
There, the shapes are prescribed by fewer than 30 param-
eters, while we allow every vertex in the mesh to move.

3. Background

Manifolds. We model a shape as a compact connected 2-
dimensional Riemannian manifold X (possibly with bound-
ary ∂X ) embedded either in R2 (ﬂat shape) or R3 (sur-
face). The intrinsic gradient ∇ and the positive semi-
deﬁnite Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ on X generalize the
corresponding notions of gradient and Laplacian from Eu-
clidean spaces to manifolds. In particular, ∆ admits a spec-
tral decomposition

∆ϕi(x) = λiϕi(x)
h∇ϕi(x), ˆn(x)i = 0

x ∈ int(X )

x ∈ ∂X ,

with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (2); here
ˆn denotes the normal vector to the boundary.

Spectrum. The spectrum of X is the sequence of eigenval-
ues of its Laplacian. These form a discrete set, which is a
canonically ordered non-decreasing sequence:

where λ1 has multiplicity 1 due to the connectedness of X ;
for i > 1, the multiplicity of λi is related to the intrin-
sic symmetries of X . The growth rate of the ordered se-
quence (λi) is further related to the total surface area of X
via Weyl’s asymptotic law [38]:

sampled at vertices V = {v1, . . . , vn}, and where each edge
eij ∈ Ei ∪ Eb belongs to at most two triangle faces Fijk
and Fjih. We denote by Ei and Eb the interior and bound-
ary edges, respectively. The discrete Riemannian metric is
deﬁned by assigning a length ℓij > 0 to each edge eij ∈ E;
see Figure 2 for the notation.

A d-dimensional embedding for X is realized by assign-
ing coordinates in Rd to the vertices V ; these are encoded
in a n × d matrix V containing d-dimensional vertex coor-
dinates vi for i = 1, . . . , n as its rows. Edge lengths can
thus be written in terms of V as:

ℓij(V) = kvi − vjk2

The discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator assumes the
form of a n× n matrix ∆ = A−1W, where A is a diagonal
matrix of local area elements ai = 1

W is a symmetric matrix of edge-wise weights, deﬁned in

This discretization clearly depends on the mesh connec-

tex coordinates V (via the lengths ℓij ); since both play im-
portant roles in our reconstruction problem, we make this
dependency explicit by writing ∆X (V).

(k = 10, 20, and 30 eigenvalues increasing left to right). In each
test, the mesh graph connectivity of the target is known and input to
the optimization process. We report the IOU score below each re-
construction. A ﬁner sampling signiﬁcantly improves reconstruc-
tion quality, whereas extending the bandwidth above k = 30 does
not lead to further improvement.

4. Isospectralization

Our approach builds upon the assumption that knowl-
edge of a limited portion of the spectrum is enough to ﬁx
the shape of the domain, given some minimal amount of
additional information which we phrase as simple regular-
izers. We consider inverse problems of this form:

min

V∈Rn×d

kλ(∆X (V)) − µkω + ρX (V) ,

(7)

where V is the (unknown) embedding of the mesh vertices
in Rd, ∆X (V) is the associated discrete Laplacian, k · kω
is a weighted norm deﬁned below, and µ, λ ∈ Rk
+ respec-
tively denote the input sequence and the ﬁrst k eigenvalues
of ∆X (V). Function ρX is a regularizer for the embed-
ding, implementing the natural expectation that the sought
solution should satisfy certain desirable properties.

Using a standard ℓ2 norm for the data term in (7) would
not lead to accurate shape recovery: Since the high end of
the spectrum accounts for small geometric variations of the
embedding, a local optimum can be reached by perfectly
aligning the high frequencies and concentrating most of the
alignment error on the lower end (which accounts for the
more global shape appearance). To make error diffusion
more balanced, we thus adopt the weighted norm

tests we observed almost perfect alignment; we refer to the
implementation Section 4.3 for further details.

4.1. Flat shapes

When the embedding space is R2, a shape X is entirely
determined by its boundary ∂X . For this reason, we con-
sider a variant of Problem (7) where we optimize only for
the boundary vertices.

Regularizers. We adopt the composite penalty

ρX (V) = ρX,1(V) + ρX,2(V) ,

(9)

where ρX,1(V) is a Tikhonov regularizer promoting short
edge lengths and thus a uniformly sized mesh:

ρX,1(V) = X

(min{0, x})2. This term penalizes triangle ﬂips that may
occur throughout the optimization, and works under the as-
sumption of clockwise oriented triangles.

Error measure. We quantify the reconstruction quality as
the area ratio of the intersection of the recovered and target
embeddings over their union (IOU, the higher the better) af-
ter an optimal alignment has been carried out. In our plots,
we visualize the recovered embedding with a blue outline,
and the ground-truth (unknown) target with a red outline.

Problem (7) seeks a Euclidean embedding whose Lapla-
cian eigenvalues align to the ones given as input. This prob-
lem is highly non-linear and thus particularly difﬁcult, mak-
ing it susceptible to local minima. Nevertheless, in all our

Mesh resolution and bandwidth. By operating with a dis-
crete Laplace operator, our optimization problem is directly
affected by the quality of the discretization. We investi-
gate this dependency by running an evaluation at varying

mesh resolution (in terms of number of vertices) and spec-
tral bandwidth (number k of input eigenvalues). The results
are reported in Figure 3.

Examples. In Figure 4 we show additional reconstruction
results for different shapes. We remark that, differently
from the previous tests, in these experiments we do not as-
sume the mesh connectivity to be known. This way we put
ourselves in the most general setting where the only input
information is represented by the eigenvalues, thus factor-
ing out any geometric aid that might be implicitly encoded
in the connectivity graph.

Topology. At no point in our pipeline we assume the mani-
folds to be simply-connected. An example of recovery of a
shape with a hole is given in Figure 5. We do assume, how-
ever, to know the topological class (e.g., annulus-like rather
than disc-like) of the target.

This term is useful in disambiguating isometries which dif-

4.3. Implementation details

In the more general case of embeddings in R3 we once
again adopt a composite penalty ρX (V) = ρX,1(V) +
ρX,2(V) with two different regularizers.

The ﬁrst regularizer requires vertices to lie on the

barycenter of their one-ring neighbors. It is deﬁned as:

ρX,1(V) = kLVk2

F ,

(12)

where L is the graph Laplacian of the initial embedding.
This term has the effect of promoting both a smooth surface
and a more uniformly sampled embedding [35].

The second regularizer is a volume expansion term
where the shape volume is estimated via the (discrete) di-

Figure 6. Two isometric shapes with different volume; their (iden-
tical) spectra are shown on the right. The volume regularizer (13)
allows to disambiguate the two solutions.

In the ﬂat shape scenario, even though we optimize (7)
only over boundary vertices, the interior vertices need to
be moved as well so as to maintain a regular sampling.
We do so by alternating optimization: First, the boundary
vertices are updated for 10 iterations; then, interior ver-
tices are re-positioned by minimizing their induced squared
edge length. To avoid degenerate triangles, after 200 steps
we also recompute a new triangulation from scratch while
keeping the boundary edges ﬁxed. While this procedure has
no convergence guarantees, we observed convergence in all
our experiments. An example of energy behavior during
minimization is shown in Figures 7 and 8.

For

the numerical optimization we leverage auto-
differentiation, and employ the Adam [24] optimizer of
Tensorﬂow [2], adopting a cosine decay strategy for the reg-
ularizer weights. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we only use
the ﬁrst 30 eigenvalues on both ﬂat shapes and surfaces, re-
sampled respectively to 400 and 1000 points.

We ﬁnally note that our optimization strategy has no
guarantee to reach a (local or global) optimum; however, in
all our tests we empirically observed negligible numerical
residual after eigenvalues alignment.

Figure 9. Alignment of eigenspaces as a result of isospectralization for non-isometric shape matching. Starting from a source shape X
(ﬁrst row), our algorithm solves for a new embedding X ′ (middle row) having the same Laplacian eigenvalues as those of the target Y.
Note how X ′ has the pose of X , but the style of Y. Remarkably, the eigenvalue alignment induces an alignment of the corresponding
eigenfunctions, making the pairs (ψ′
i, φi) more similar than the initial pairs (ψi, φi). This is reﬂected in more diagonal functional map
matrices (rightmost column), which in turn leads to a better conditioning for shape matching algorithms.

5. Applications in shape analysis

5.1. Non isometric shape matching

We have applied our shape optimization approach to
the problem of ﬁnding correspondences between non-rigid
shapes. In this setting, we are given a pair of 3D shapes
X , Y, both represented as triangle meshes, and our goal is
to ﬁnd a dense map T : X → Y between them. This is a
very well-studied problem in computer vision and computer
graphics, with a wide range of techniques proposed over the
years (see [37, 36, 8] for several surveys).

Non-rigid shape matching is particularly difﬁcult, as it
would require designing a universal correspondence algo-
rithm, capable of handling arbitrary deformations in a fully
automatic way. A very successful sub-class of non-rigid

shape deformations is intrinsic isometries, in which the
underlying map T is assumed to approximately preserve
geodesic distances between pairs of points on the shapes.
A large number of efﬁcient methods has been proposed
to solve the shape matching problem under this assump-
tion [4, 8]. At the same time, most of these techniques result
in very poor correspondences whenever the assumption of
intrinsic isometry is not satisﬁed.

Approach. Our main insight is that the alignment of the
spectra of two shapes can make them more intrinsically iso-
metric, and thus can facilitate ﬁnding accurate correspon-
dences using existing techniques. Given shapes X , Y, with
Laplacian spectra λX , λY we propose to ﬁnd a map be-
tween them using the following three-step approach:

Figure 10. Results on non-isometric shape matching. The plots on the left are averaged over 60 non-isometric shape pairs from the FAUST
inter-subject dataset [9]. In order to visualize correspondence, we use it to transfer a texture from reference shape to target.

1. Deform X to obtain X ′ whose spectrum λX ′ is better

aligned with λY .

2. Compute the correspondence T ′ : X ′ → Y using an

existing isometric shape matching algorithm.

3. Convert T ′ to T : X → Y using the identity map

between X and X ′.

Our main intuition is that as mentioned above, despite the
existence of exceptional counter-examples, in most practi-
cal cases this procedure is very likely to make shapes X ′
and Y close to being isometric. Therefore, we would ex-
pect an isometric shape matching algorithm to match Y to
X ′ better than to the original shape X . Finally, after com-
puting a map T : X ′ → Y, we can trivially convert it to a
map, since X , X ′ are in 1-1 correspondence.

The approach described above builds upon the remark-
able observation that aligning the Laplacian eigenvalues
also induces an alignment of the eigenspaces of the two
shapes. This is illustrated on a real example in Figure 9,
where we show a subset of eigenfunctions for two non-
isometric surfaces (a man and a woman) before and after
isospectralization. In a sense, isospectralization implements
a notion of correspondence-free alignment of the functional
spaces spanned by the ﬁrst k Laplacian eigenfunctions.

Implementation. For this and the following application,
we replaced the optimization variables by optimizing over a
displacement ﬁeld rather than the absolute vertex positions
in Problem (7). Doing so, we observed a better quality of
the recovered embeddings.

We have implemented the approach described above
by using an existing shape correspondence algorithm [28]
based on the functional maps framework [29, 30]. One
of the advantages of this approach is that it is purely in-
trinsic and only depends on the quantities derived from the
Laplace-Beltrami operators of the two shapes.

does not play a role, and can be different from that of Y.
In other words, we do not aim to reproduce the shape Y,
but rather only use our shape optimization strategy as an
auxiliary step to facilitate shape correspondence.

We use the functional maps-based algorithm of [28] with
the open source implementation provided by the authors.
This algorithm is based on ﬁrst solving for a functional map
represented in the Laplacian eigenbasis [3] by using sev-
eral descriptor-preservation and regularization constraints,
and then converting the functional map to a pointwise one.
As done in [28], we used the wave kernel signature [5] as
descriptors and commutativity with the Laplace-Beltrami
operators for map regularization. This leads to a convex
optimization problem which can be efﬁciently solved with
an iterative quasi-Newton method. Finally, we convert the
functional map to a pointwise one using nearest neighbor
search in the spectral domain as in [29]. We evaluate the
quality of the ﬁnal correspondence by measuring the aver-
age geodesic error with respect to some externally-provided
ground truth map [23]. We refer to Figures 1 (bottom row),
10, 11, and 12 for quantitative and qualitative results.

5.2. Style transfer

style transfer between deformable shapes. Given a pair of

surfaces X (the source) and Y (the target), the idea is to
modify the geometric details of X to match those of shape
Y. We do so simply by recovering an embedding in R3
from the eigenvalues λY , where we initialize the optimiza-
tion with the source shape X . Qualitative examples of this
procedure are shown in Figure 13.

Remark. We emphasize that this way of transferring style
among given shapes is completely correspondence-free, as
it does not require a map between them. This is different
from existing approaches like [25, 11], which in addition to
requiring the entire Laplacian matrix, also require a precise
map between X and Y to be given as input.

6. Discussion and conclusions

“Vibrations are everywhere, and so too are
the eigenvalues associated with them.” (Par-
lett, 1998)

In this paper, we addressed the decades-old problem of
recovering a metric embedding from a (partial) measure-
ment of its Laplacian eigenvalues by introducing a numeri-
cal procedure called isospectralization, trying to deform the
shape embedding to align its Laplacian eigenvalues with
a given spectrum. We ﬁnd it remarkable that the use of
isospectralization simpliﬁes the problem of ﬁnding intrin-
sic correspondences between shapes, allowing us to signif-
icantly improve standard pipelines for shape matching al-
most for free. Interestingly, there is no a priori guarantee
that the isospectralization process deforms the shapes in a
sensible way (for instance, it is conceivable that isospec-
tralizing a horse into a camel would result in the horse’s
legs collapsing while a new set grows out of its back, which
would spoil the construction of the correspondence). Our
results suggest that such situations do not arise in practice
when using a gradient descent-like algorithm that deforms
the shape progressively.
In other words, our approach to
isospectralization deforms the shape in a meaningful way.
It would be of interest to obtain a mathematically precise

In
these four examples (one per column), we transfer the style of
the target shape (third row) to the source shape (ﬁrst row), ob-
taining the embeddings shown in the middle. Since here we
use few eigenvalues, only smooth details are transferred. The

statement of this meaningfulness. This would be of both
practical importance in shape matching and, potentially,
mathematical interest in the ﬁeld of spectral geometry.
