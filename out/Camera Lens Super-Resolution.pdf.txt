Abstract

Existing methods for single image super-resolution (SR)
are typically evaluated with synthetic degradation models
such as bicubic or Gaussian downsampling. In this paper,
we investigate SR from the perspective of camera lenses,
named as CameraSR, which aims to alleviate the intrinsic
tradeoff between resolution (R) and ﬁeld-of-view (V) in real-
istic imaging systems. Speciﬁcally, we view the R-V degra-
dation as a latent model in the SR process and learn to re-
verse it with realistic low- and high-resolution image pairs.
To obtain the paired images, we propose two novel data ac-
quisition strategies for two representative imaging systems
(i.e., DSLR and smartphone cameras), respectively. Based
on the obtained City100 dataset, we quantitatively analyze
the performance of commonly-used synthetic degradation
models, and demonstrate the superiority of CameraSR as
a practical solution to boost the performance of existing
SR methods. Moreover, CameraSR can be readily gener-
alized to different content and devices, which serves as an
advanced digital zoom tool in realistic imaging systems.

1. Introduction

Single image super-resolution (SR) is a typical inverse
problem in computer vision. Generally, SR methods as-
sume bicubic or Gaussian downsampling as the degradation
model [33]. Based on this assumption, continuous progress
has been achieved to restore a better high-resolution (HR)
image from its low-resolution (LR) version, in terms of re-
construction accuracy [9, 13, 15, 17, 23, 25, 27, 31, 32, 35, 36]
or perceptual quality [2, 3, 5, 12, 16, 22, 28]. However, these
synthetic degradation models may deviate from the ones in
realistic imaging systems, which results in a signiﬁcant de-
terioration on the SR performance [20]. To better simulate
the challenging real-world conditions, additional factors in-
cluding noise, motion blur, and compression artifacts are in-
tegrated to characterize the LR images in either a synthetic
[26] or a data-driven [4] manner. These modiﬁed degrada-
tion models promote the SR performance of learning-based

methods when the LR images indeed have corresponding
degradations.

In this paper, we investigate SR from the perspective of
camera lenses, named as CameraSR, which aims to alleviate
the intrinsic tradeoff between resolution (R) and ﬁeld-of-
view (FoV, V for short hereafter) in realistic imaging sys-
tems. An instance of the R-V tradoff is shown in Fig. 1(a).
When zooming out the optical lens in a DSLR camera, the
obtained image has a larger FoV but loses details on sub-
jects; when zooming in the lens, the details of subjects show
up at the cost of a reduced FoV. This R-V tradeoff also ap-
plies to cameras with ﬁxed focal lenses such as those on
smartphones when the shooting distance changes. Inspired
by learning-based single image SR, we view the R-V degra-
dation (i.e., resolution loss due to enlarged FoV) as a latent
model in the SR process and learn to reverse it with a num-
ber of LR-HR image pairs. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a subject
captured at a long focal length or a short distance as the
HR ground truth, and the same one captured at a short focal
length or a long distance as its paired LR observation.

To obtain such paired images, we ﬁrst use a DSLR cam-
era mounted on a tripod with a zoom lens. To avoid the out-
of-focus blur, we adopt a small aperture size and capture

100 city scenes printed on postcards as the subjects which
can be well focused at different focal lengths. In practice,
however, several issues due to the mechanical zoom pro-
hibit the direct use of the captured raw data, including spa-
tial misalignment, intensity variation, and color mismatch-
ing. After addressing these issues through an elaborate
data rectiﬁcation pipeline, we build a dataset consisting of
100 aligned image pairs named “City100”. An example is
shown in Fig. 1(b). Following the same pipeline, we then
obtain a variant of City100 by using a smartphone camera
mounted on a translation stage with a ﬁxed focal lens. The
City100 dataset, together with its smartphone version, char-
acterizes the R-V degradation in two representative realistic
imaging systems.

Based on City100, we conduct a quantitative analysis on
the commonly-used synthetic degradation models, in terms
of both LR observations and SR results. Take the bicubic
downsampling as an example, due to the underestimation
of R-V degradation (as shown in Fig. 2), it results in a sig-
niﬁcant deterioration on the SR performance (as shown in
Fig. 3). This analysis validates the importance of degra-
dation modeling for the resolution enhancement in realistic
imaging systems. Observing the disadvantage of synthetic
degradation models, we propose CameraSR as a practical
solution to boost the performance of existing SR methods,
by learning the R-V degradation from City100. Compre-
hensive experiments demonstrate that CameraSR achieves a
signiﬁcant improvement of SR results compared with those
using synthetic degradation models.

More importantly, we demonstrate that CamereSR has a
favorable capability of generalization in terms of both con-
tent and device. Speciﬁcally, an SR network trained on
City100 can be readily generalized to other scene content,
as well as to other type of devices belonging to the same cat-
egory of imaging systems (e.g., from Nikon to other DSLRs
and from iPhone to other smartphones). By effectively alle-
viating the R-V tradeoff or even breaking the physical zoom

ratio of an optical lens in realistic imaging systems, Cam-
eraSR could ﬁnd a wide application in practice as an ad-
vanced digital zoom tool.

Contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

• A new perspective, i.e., R-V degradation of camera
lenses, for SR modeling in realistic imaging systems.

• Two novel strategies for acquiring LR-HR image pairs
as in City100 to characterize the R-V degradation un-
der DSLR and smartphone cameras, respectively.

• Quantitative analysis on the commonly-used synthetic

degradation models using realistic data.

• An effective solution, i.e., CameraSR, to promote ex-
isting learning-based SR methods in realistic imaging
systems.

2. Related Work

Recent years have seen a remarkable improvement in
single image SR. To promote the reconstruction accuracy,
increasingly more learning-based methods adopt the con-
volutional neural network (CNN) following the seminal
work of SRCNN [6]. For instance, Kim et al. proposed
VDSR [13] which deepens the network for accuracy with
the residual learning. Lai et al. proposed LapSRN [15]
which improves the SR results at large scale factors with the
Laplacian pyramid structure. Furthermore, various mecha-
nisms have been integrated into the network design to ad-
vance the SR performance, such as sparsity [30], contigu-
ous memory [36], deep supervision [27], recursion [14, 25],
back-projection [9], information distillation [10], and atten-
tion [35]. Different from the above methods, Ledig et al.
proposed SRGAN [16] which is optimized for perceptual
quality instead of reconstruction accuracy. Along this line,
Sajjadi et al. proposed EnhanceNet [22] which promotes the
quality of texture synthesis with a perceptual loss. Wang et

1653

al. proposed SFTGAN [28] which integrates a spatial fea-
ture transform layer into GAN [8] to further enhance the SR
performance. However, most existing learning-based meth-
ods adopt a synthetic degradation model (e.g., bicubic or
Gaussian downsampling) when formulating the SR prob-
lem, which hinders their performance in realistic imaging
systems with much more complicated degradation.

There are a few works that involve realistic degrada-
tion modeling for single image SR. For instance, Timofte et
al. introduced more degradation operators into the bicubic-
downsampled LR images, including motion blur and Pois-
son noise [26]. Bulat et al. deﬁned the LR face images with
the low-quality assumptions (e.g., noise, blur, and compres-
sion artifacts) and trained a GAN [8] to learn the degra-
dation process [4]. On the other hand, as a self-similarity
based method, Michaeli and Irani adaptively estimated the
degradation model relying on the inherent recurrence of the
input image [20]. Shocher et al. further optimized an image-
speciﬁc CNN with examples solely extracted from the input
image [23].

Different from the above approaches, our proposed Cam-
eraSR models the R-V degradation from the perspective of
camera lenses. The estimation of R-V degradation neither
relies on the low-quality assumptions nor the inherent re-
currence of LR images. Instead, it is characterized by the
samples captured with realistic imaging systems. Such a
degradation modeling is inspired by the prior work for re-
alistic image denoising [21], where a subject captured at a
high ISO value is deﬁned noisy and the same one captured
at a low ISO value is deﬁned clean. We extend this deﬁni-
tion to the SR scenario, which addresses the key challenge
of obtaining realistic LR-HR image pairs. Note that the fo-
cus of this paper is not the network design. For the com-
parison purpose, we adopt VDSR [13] and SRGAN [16] as
two representative embodiments to demonstrate the effec-
tiveness and generalizability of CameraSR, which can be
replaced with any CNN-based methods.

3. Problem Formulation

Consider again taking photos using a DSLR camera with
an optical zoom lens. Zooming out the lens derives a larger
FoV at the cost of resolution loss on the subject. Denote this
R-V degradation as DRV (·), our goal is to obtain a function
S(·) that reverses DRV (·) for realistic image SR. This prob-
lem can be formulated as

ˆX = S(DRV (X)),

(1)

where X denotes the original image and ˆX denotes the
super-resolved one. Compared with previous SR formula-
tions, the only difference lies in the modeling for the degra-
dation process. For instance, the bicubic downsampling
DBic(·) formulates the SR problem as ˆX = S(DBic(X))

and the Gaussian downsampling as ˆX = S(DGau(X)). For
the more complicated degradation model imposed in [26], it
is ˆX = S(DBlur(DBic(X)) + v), where DBlur(·) denotes
a blurring operator and v denotes a certain kind of noise.

Unlike the synthetic degradation models as mentioned
above, it is difﬁcult to derive an analytic expression for
DRV (·).
Inspired by learning-based SR, we view the R-
V degradation as a latent model ˆDRV (·) in the SR pro-
cess and directly learn the parametric SR function SΘ(·)
with N pairs of realistic LR (Y = {Y1, Y2, ..., YN }) and
HR (X = {X1, X2, ..., XN }) samples, which can be repre-
sented as

ˆX = SΘ( ˆDRV (X)),

(2)
where ˆDRV (·) is subject to Y = ˆDRV (X). With the in-
crease of the number of samples N , we have ˆDRV (·) →
DRV (·). Then, SΘ(·) can be optimized with a loss function
L(·) as

i=1

L(Xi − SΘ(Yi)),

where Θ denotes a set of trainable parameters and n denotes
the size of mini-batch when optimizing Θ with the stochas-
tic gradient descent algorithm.

This is the main idea of CameraSR, which will be de-
tailed in Sec. 5.2. While the problem formulation is quite
intuitive, the key challenge is, how to obtain the LR-HR im-
age pairs in realistic imaging systems?

4. Data Acquisition

4.1. DSLR imaging system

To capture the realistic LR-HR image pairs, we use a
Nikon D5500 camera mounted on a tripod with a Zoom-
Nikkor lens, whose focal length ranges from 18mm to
55mm. We deﬁne an image captured at 55mm focal length
as the HR ground truth and the one captured at 18mm focal
length as the LR observation. To alleviate the inﬂuence of
noise, the ISO value is set to the lowest level. The other
settings such as white balance and aperture size are ﬁxed
for each capture.
In practice, however, we observe sev-
eral issues for prohibiting the direct use of the captured
raw data, including spatial misalignment, intensity varia-
tion, and color mismatching.
It is probably due to the
fact that the change of focal length is a mechanical pro-
cess which cannot be ideally controlled. It thus results in
slight dithering of the camera body as well as the exposure
conﬁguration. To address these issues, we elaborate a data
rectiﬁcation pipeline.

First, we model the spatial misalignment as a global 2D
translation inspired by [11]. Speciﬁcally, we compute and
match SIFT key-points [18] between the HR images and
the interpolated LR ones. Then, the matched coordinates
are used to estimate a homography using RANSAC [7].

calibration, from the LR observation (a) to its HR ground truth (b).

Figure 5. Acquisition strategy for the smartphone version of City
100. Translating the smartphone away from a subject (from A to
B), the effective resolution is decreased due to the enlarged FoV
(R-V degradation).

Having the translation parameters, we shift the LR images
through interpolation to obtain the aligned results. Note that
the interpolation will introduce some smoothing effects, but
not critical for the already interpolated LR images which
contain relatively fewer high frequencies. We avoid shift-
ing the HR images since they contain a lot of desired de-
tails. Second, we model the intensity variation as a bias
in the DC component of an image and estimate it by aver-
aging the pixel intensities in the whole image. Then, we
use the estimated bias to compensate this variation. Third,
we model the color mismatching as a parametric non-linear
mapping and ﬁt it with polynomial parameters for calibra-
tion by leveraging a color checkerboard, as shown in Fig. 4.
Speciﬁcally, we collect and average pixel values in each
block from the color checkerboard to obtain paired samples
from the LR observation to its HR ground truth. Then, we
ﬁt three polynomial curves for R, G, and B channels using
the collected samples, respectively. Finally, we map pixels
in LR observations using the obtained polynomial curves.

After the above data rectiﬁcation, we build a City100
dataset using the DSLR camera, in which 100 city scenes
printed on high-quality postcards are adopted as the sub-
jects. The plane shape of postcards guarantees that the
whole image can be well focused under a small aperture size
at both long and short focal lengths, which avoids the out-
of-focus blur. The resolution of ﬁnal HR images in City100
is 1218 × 870, which is 2.9 times of the LR ones. Images
from City100 have diverse colors and contents, which facil-
itate leaning-based SR. An overview of the City100 dataset
is shown in the supplementary document.

4.2. Smartphone imaging system

Different from the zoom lenses in professional DSLR
cameras, commodity smartphone cameras are generally
equipped with prime lenses whose focal length cannot
change.
In this sense, the realistic degradation modeling
is even more meaningful to smartphones, where CameraSR
can serve as a powerful digital zoom tool. However, lim-
ited by the ﬁxed focal lens, LR-HR image pairs for smart-
phone cameras cannot be captured with the same strategy
as for DSLR cameras. Alternatively, we develop another
strategy for obtaining the smartphone version of City100,

as shown in Fig. 5. An iPhone X mounted on a transla-
tion stage is used for data acquisition, and the position of
iPhone relative to the translation stage can be precisely ad-
justed. We deﬁne an image captured at a short distance as
the HR ground truth, and the one captured at a long distance
as the LR observation. To avoid the “intelligent” exposure
conﬁguration by the smartphone itself, we use the ProCam1
software to manually control the settings such as ISO, white
balance, exposure time and so on. The data rectiﬁcation
pipeline for smartphone is similar to that for DSLR as de-
tailed in Sec. 4.1. In addition, considering that smartphone
images have notably heavier noise than DSLR images due
to the much smaller sensor size, we repeat the capture of
each scene 20 times and average the resulting images to al-
leviate the inﬂuence of noise. The resolution of ﬁnal HR
images is 2.4 times of the LR ones.

It is worth mentioning that, the City100 dataset and its
smartphone version are obtained by two representative re-
alistic imaging systems, i.e., DSLR and smartphone. Al-
though two speciﬁc devices, i.e., Nikon D5500 and iPhone
X are used here, the trained CameraSR network has a favor-
able capability of generalization and can be readily applied
to different devices belonging to the same category of imag-
ing systems (as detailed in Sec. 6.2).

5. Analysis on Degradation Models

In this section, our goal is to quantitatively analyze the
performance of commonly used synthetic degradation mod-
els DBic(·) and DGau(·), in comparison with the realistic
R-V degradation DRV (·) based on the paired samples from
our developed City100 dataset. Since DRV (·) has not an
analytic expression, it is difﬁcult to conduct direct compar-
isons between them. Thus, we turn to the corresponding LR
observations and SR results for quantitative comparisons.

5.1. LR observation

Given an HR image X from City100, the LR observa-
tions are obtained by DBic(X), DGau(X), and DRV (X)
(i.e., the paired Y from City100), respectively. As demon-
strated in Fig. 2, DBic(·) underestimates the degradation

disadvantage of synthetic degradation models.

level of DRV (·), which results in a signiﬁcant deterioration
on the SR performance as shown in Fig. 3.

Besides DBic(·), we further investigate DGau(·).

In
practice, the Gaussian downsampling ﬁrst blurs X with a
Gaussian ﬁlter and then conducts pixel decimation at des-
ignated scale factors. To match the scale factor of sam-
ples from City100, we adapt DGau(·) for ×2.9 downsam-
pling by ﬁrst interpolating an image X 3/2.9 times fol-
lowed by a ×3 decimation.
In contrast to the bicubic
downsampling, the Gaussian downsampling is more ﬂexi-
ble as its kernel size k × k and standard deviation σ can
be manually controlled. Here, we consider an ideal con-
dition when the degradation level of DGau(X) matches
DRV (X) in terms of the LR observation. To this end, we
traverse k and σ as shown in Fig. 6(a). After interpolat-
ing DGau(X) and DRV (X) to the same resolution as X,
we calculate the mean PSNR between them on City100 and
ﬁnd two matched parameters at the red points (with k1 = 5,
σ1 = 2.65 and k2 = 7, σ2 = 1.55), which are adopted as
the representatives of DGau(·).

5.2. SR result

Obtained the LR observations, we then evaluate the
performance of different degradation models on the SR
results, by comparing S(DBic(X)), S(DGau(X)), and
S(DRV (X)) to the ground truth X. We name the cor-
responding SR processes as BicubicSR, GaussianSR, and
CameraSR for short, respectively. To train an SR network,
we split City100 into two parts: 5 selected pairs for test
(as shown in Fig. 7) and the other 95 pairs for training.
Among the training set, 5 images are used for validation.
For the baseline network, we adopt two representative CNN
architectures considering the perception-distortion tradeoff
reported in [1]. For reconstruction accuracy, we adopt the
VDSR network [13] with a mean square loss

LM SE = ||SΘ(D(x)) − x||2
2,

(4)

where x denotes an image patch cropped from X on
City100, D(·) denotes the a certain degradation model, and
SΘ(·) denotes the parametric SR network.

For perceptual quality, we adopt the SRGAN network

[16] with a combined loss

LComb = LM SE + LV GG + 10e−3LGen,

(5)

where the VGG loss LV GG represents the pixel-wise dis-
tance in the feature space φ(·) of a VGG-19 network [24]

LV GG = ||φ(SΘ(D(x))) − φ(x)||2

and the generative loss LGen is deﬁned based on the proba-
bility of a discriminator DΘ′ (·) as

LGen = −logDΘ′ (SΘ(D(x))),

Then, we train two sets of SR networks for DBic(·),
DGau(·), and DRV (·) based on City100, respectively. All
other hyper-parameters except the degradation model are
kept the same to eliminate the inﬂuence of them. The quan-
titative results evaluated on PSNR are shown in Fig. 6(b),
where both BicubicSR and GaussianSR have a notable per-
formance gap (i.e., about 1.3 dB in average on the test set)
compared with CameraSR. For GaussianSR, we evaluate
two settings at the red points in Fig. 6(a) and report the
better one. Detailed quantitative results are listed in Ta-
ble 1. The corresponding visual comparisons are conducted
in Figs. 8 and 9 for VDSR [13] and SRGAN [16] respec-
tively, which again validates the signiﬁcantly improved SR
results achieved by CameraSR. More results for comparison
can be found in the supplementary document.

6. Experiments

While the above analysis clearly demonstrates the impor-
tance of degradation modeling for the resolution enhance-
ment of realistic imaging systems, it is not so surprising that
CameraSR outperforms BicubicSR and GaussianSR since

it directly learns the R-V degradation from City100. In this
section, we show extensive SR results to demonstrate the
generalizability of CameraSR (still trained on City100) to
real-world scenes that are drastically different from City100
in content and even captured with different devices. Still,
BicubicSR and GaussianSR are adopted for comparisons,
in terms of reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality.

6.1. Advanced digital zoom

Recall that our main goal is to alleviate the R-V tradeoff
or even break the physical zoom ratio of an optical lens in
realistic imaging systems, we now demonstrate that Cam-
eraSR achieves this goal. As shown in Fig. 10(a), given
an image captured by a DSLR camera at the focal length
of 18mm, CameraSR effectively super-resolves its details,
which can be viewed as alleviating the R-V tradeoff of the
camera lens (i.e., resolution and FoV are now obtained at
the same time). Meanwhile, when the zoom lens of the
same DSLR camera reaches its maximum magniﬁcation at
the focal length of 55mm, CameraSR is capable of further
enhancing the resolution of the captured image, as shown in

Fig. 10(b). Similarly in Fig. 11, for a smartphone camera
with a ﬁxed focal lens, CameraSR serves as an advanced
digital zoom tool, which signiﬁcantly enhances the imaging
quality compared with the built-in digital zoom function.
The examples in Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 11 can be viewed as
breaking the physical limit of zoom ratio.

6.2. Generalizability

Besides the signiﬁcant improvement of SR performance,
our proposed CameraSR also has a favorable generaliza-
tion capability in terms of both content and device. For
the content generalization, recall that the City100 dataset
is captured under an indoor environment with a single cat-
egory of subjects (i.e., postcard), yet the CameraSR model
trained on City100 performs well in both indoor and out-
door environments with diverse subjects, as demonstrated
in Figs. 10, 11, 12. For the device generalization, as shown
in Fig. 12, the CameraSR model trained on the iPhone X
version of City100 can be readily applied to different smart-
phones such as Huawei P20 and Samsung S9. More results
for the generalization from Nikon to Canon DSLR cameras
are shown in the supplementary document.

7. Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we investigate SR from the perspective of
camera lenses, named as CameraSR, which models the R-
V degradation in realistic imaging systems. With the pro-
posed data acquisition strategies, we build a City100 dataset
to characterize the R-V degradation in representative DSLR
and smartphone cameras. Based on City100, we analyze
the disadvantage of the commonly used synthetic degrada-

tion models and validate CameraSR as a practical solution
to boost the performance of existing SR methods. Due to its
favorable generalization capability, CameraSR could ﬁnd a
wide application as an advanced digital zoom tool in real-
istic imaging systems. Especially, besides the enhancement
of natural images, we believe CameraSR has a great value
for biomedical imaging with microscopes, where the reso-
lution enhancement is essential for scientiﬁc observation.

Despite the promising preliminary results, there are still
some real-world conditions that have not been considered
in this paper. In terms of the LR observation, we consider
a relatively ideal condition without noise. Yet the inﬂuence
of noise is inevitable, especially in the smartphone imaging
systems with small sensors. It is thus worth to jointly in-
vestigate the R-V degradation and noise to further promote
the robustness of CameraSR. Besides single image SR dis-
cussed in this paper, the R-V degradation can be general-
ized to burst image SR, where a sequence of LR images
are captured using the burst shooting mode to exploit the
underlying information from the sub-pixel motion for a bet-
ter HR reconstruction. Moreover, beyond the prior learned
from external examples, the proposed CameraSR can be
further extended for self-similarity based methods to utilize
the inherent recurrence, by numerically estimating the R-V
degradation kernel based on City100. The above extensions
are considered as our future work.
