Abstract

Convolutional networks for single-view object recon-
struction have shown impressive performance and have
become a popular subject of research. All existing tech-
niques are united by the idea of having an encoder-decoder
network that performs non-trivial reasoning about the 3D
structure of the output space. In this work, we set up two al-
ternative approaches that perform image classiﬁcation and
retrieval respectively. These simple baselines yield better
results than state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. We show that encoder-decoder methods are
statistically indistinguishable from these baselines, thus in-
dicating that the current state of the art in single-view object
reconstruction does not actually perform reconstruction but
image classiﬁcation. We identify aspects of popular experi-
mental procedures that elicit this behavior and discuss ways
to improve the current state of research.

1. Introduction

Object-based single-view 3D reconstruction calls for
generating the 3D model of an object given a single image.

requires a complex process that combines low-level image
cues, knowledge about structural arrangement of parts, and
high-level semantic information. We refer to the extremes
of this spectrum as reconstruction and recognition. Recon-
struction implies reasoning about the 3D structure of the
input image using cues such as texture, shading, and per-
spective effects. Recognition amounts to classifying the in-
put image and retrieving the most suitable 3D model from
a database, in our example ﬁnding a pre-existing 3D model
of a motorcycle based on the input image.

While various architectures and 3D representations have
been proposed in the literature, existing methods for single-
view 3D understanding all use an encoder-decoder struc-
ture, where the encoder maps the input image to a latent
representation and the decoder is supposed to perform non-
trivial reasoning about the 3D structure of the output space.
To solve the task, the overall network is expected to incor-
porate low-level as well as high-level information.

In this work, we analyze the results of state-of-the-art
encoder-decoder methods [12, 37, 46] and ﬁnd that they
rely primarily on recognition to address the single-view 3D
reconstruction task, while showing only limited reconstruc-
tion abilities. To support this claim, we design two pure
recognition baselines: one that combines 3D shape cluster-
ing and image classiﬁcation and one that performs image-
based 3D shape retrieval. Based on these, we demonstrate

3405

that the performance of modern convolutional networks for
single-view 3D reconstruction can be surpassed even with-
out explicitly inferring the 3D structure of objects. In many
cases the predictions of the recognition baselines are not
only better quantitatively, but also appear visually more ap-
pealing, as demonstrated in Fig. 1.

We argue that the dominance of recognition in convolu-
tional networks for single-view 3D reconstruction is a con-
sequence of certain aspects of popular experimental proce-
dures, including dataset composition and evaluation proto-
cols. These allow the network to ﬁnd a shortcut solution,
which happens to be image recognition.

2. Related work

Historically, single-image 3D reconstruction has been
approached via shape-from-shading [6, 16, 57]. More ex-
otic cues for reconstruction are texture [28] and defocus [9].
These techniques only reason about visible parts of a sur-
face using a single depth cue. More general approaches for
depth estimation from a single monocular image use multi-
ple cues as well as structural knowledge to infer an estimate
of the depth of visible surfaces. Saxena et al. [40] estimated
depth from a single image by training an MRF on local and
global image features. Oswald et al. [34] solved the same
problem with interactive user input. Hoiem et al. [15] used
recognition together with simple geometric assumptions to
construct 3D models from a single image. Karsch et al.
[19] proposed a non-parametric framework that uses part-
and object-level recognition to assemble an estimate from
a database of images and corresponding depth maps. More
recently, signiﬁcant advances have been made in monocu-
lar depth estimation by employing convolutional networks
[3, 7, 11, 26, 54].

This paper focuses on methods that not only reason about
the 3D structure of object parts visible in the input image,
but also hallucinate the invisible parts using priors learned
from data. Tulsiani et al. [47] approached this task with de-
formable models for speciﬁc object categories. Most of the
recent methods trained convolutional networks that map 2D
images to 3D shapes using direct 3D supervision. A clus-
ter of approaches used voxel-based representations of 3D
shapes and generated them with 3D up-convolutions from a
latent representation [4, 10, 53]. Several works [13, 38, 46]
performed hierarchical partitioning of the output space to
achieve computational and memory efﬁciency, which al-
lows predicting higher-resolution 3D shapes. Johnston et
al. [17] reconstructed high-resolution 3D shapes with an in-
verse discrete cosine transform decoder. Wang et al. [50]
generated meshes by deforming a sphere into a desired
shape, assuming a ﬁxed distance between camera and ob-
jects. Groueix et al. [12] assembled surfaces from small
patches. Multiple methods [27, 30, 43, 45] produced multi-
view depth maps that are fused together into an output point

cloud. Richter et al. [37] extended this with nested shapes
fused into a single voxel grid. Fan et al. [8] directly re-
gressed point clouds. Wu et al. [52] learned the mapping
from input images to 2.5D sketches in a fully-supervised
fashion, and then trained a network to map these intermedi-
ate representations to the ﬁnal 3D shapes. Kong et al. [22]
use 2D landmark locations together with silhouettes to re-
trieve and deform CAD models. Pontes et al. [35] im-
proved upon this work by using a free-form deformation
parametrization to model shape variation.

Tulsiani et al. [48] and Niu et al. [33] aimed for struc-
tural 3D understanding, approximating 3D shapes with a
pre-deﬁned set of primitives.

Recently, there has been a trend towards using weaker
forms of supervision for single-view 3D shape prediction
with convolutional networks. Multiple approaches [20, 36,
49, 55, 59] trained shape regressors by comparing projec-
tions of ground-truth and predicted shapes. Kanazawa et
al. [18] predicted deformations from mean shapes trained
from multiple learning signals.

There are only very few datasets available for the task
of single-image 3D reconstruction – a consequence of the
cost of data collection. Most existing methods use subsets
of ShapeNet [1] for training and testing. Recently, Wiles
and Zisserman [51] introduced two new synthetic datasets:
Blobby objects and Sculptures. The Pix3D dataset [44] pro-
vides pairs of perfectly aligned natural images and CAD
models. This dataset, however, contains a low number of
3D samples, which is problematic for training deep net-
works.

3. Reconstruction vs. recognition

Single-view 3D understanding is a complex task that re-
quires interpreting visual data both geometrically and se-
mantically. In fact, these two modes are not disjoint, but
span a spectrum from pure geometric reconstruction to pure
semantic recognition.

Reconstruction implies per-pixel reasoning about the 3D
structure of the object shown in the input image, which can
be achieved by using low-level image cues such as color,
texture, shading, perspective, shadows, and defocus. This
mode does not require semantic understanding of the image
content.

Recognition is an extreme case of using semantic priors: it
operates on the level of whole objects and amounts to clas-
sifying the object in the input image and retrieving a corre-
sponding 3D shape from a database. While it provides a ro-
bust prior for reasoning about the invisible parts of objects,
this kind of purely semantic solution is only valid if the new
object can be explained by an object in the database.

As reconstruction and recognition represent opposing
ends of a spectrum, resorting exclusively to either is un-

3406

likely to produce the most accurate 3D shapes, since both
ignore valuable information present in the input image. It is
thus commonly hypothesized that a successful approach to
single-view 3D reconstruction needs to combine low-level
image cues, structural knowledge, and high-level object un-
derstanding [41].

In the following sections, we argue that current methods

tackle the problem predominantly using recognition.

4. Conventional setup

In this section, we analyze current methods for single-
view 3D reconstruction and their relation to reconstruc-
tion and recognition. We employ a standard setup for
single-view 3D shape estimation. We use the ShapeNet
dataset [1]. Unlike several recent approaches, which eval-
uated only on the 13 largest classes, we deliberately use
all 55 classes, as was done in [56]. This allows us to in-
vestigate how the number of samples within a class inﬂu-
ences shape estimation performance. Within each class,
the shapes are randomly split into training, validation, and
test sets, containing 70%, 10%, and 20% of the sam-
ples respectively. Every shape was rendered using the
ShapeNet-Viewer from ﬁve uniformly sampled viewpoints
(θazimuth ∈ [0◦, 360◦), θelevation ∈ [0◦, 50◦)). The dis-
tance to the camera was set such that each rendered shape
roughly ﬁts the frame. We rendered RGB images of size
224 × 224, which were downsampled to the input resolu-
tion that is required by each method.

All 3D shapes have a consistent canonical orientation
and are represented as 1283 voxel grids. Using high-
resolution ground truth (compared to the conventionally
used 323 voxel grids) is crucial for evaluating a method’s
ability to reconstruct ﬁne detail. Evaluating on a higher res-
olution than 1283 does not offer additional beneﬁts, since
the performance of state-of-the-art methods saturates at this
level [37, 46], while training and evaluation become much
more costly. We follow standard procedure and measure
shape similarity with the mean Intersection over Union
(mIoU) metric, aggregating predictions within semantic
classes [4, 8, 13, 37, 42, 46, 55].

4.1. Existing approaches

We base our experiments on modern convolutional net-
works that predict high-resolution 3D models from a sin-
gle image. A taxonomy of approaches arises by categoriz-
ing them based on their output representation: voxel grids,
meshes, point clouds, and depth maps. To this end, we
chose state-of-the-art methods that cover the dominant out-
put representations or have clearly shown to outperform
other related representations for our evaluation.

We use Octree Generating Networks (OGN) [46] as the
representative method that predicts the output directly on a
voxel grid. Compared to earlier works [4] that operate on

this output representation, OGN allows predicting higher-
resolution shapes by using octrees to represent the occu-
pied space efﬁciently. We evaluate AtlasNet [12] as the rep-
resentative approach for surface-based methods. AtlasNet
predicts a collection of parametric surfaces and constitutes
the state-of-the-art among methods that operate on this out-
put representation.
It was shown to outperform the only
approach that directly produces point clouds as output [8],
as well as another octree-based approach [13]. Finally, we
evaluate the current state-of-the-art in the ﬁeld, Matryoshka
Networks [37]. Matryoshka Networks use a shape repre-
sentation that is composed of multiple, nested depth maps,
which are volumetrically fused into a single output object.
For IoU-based evaluation of the surface predictions from
AtlasNet, we project them to depth maps, which we further
fuse to a volumetric representation. In our experiments, this
approach reliably closed holes in the reconstructed surfaces
while retaining ﬁne details. For surface-based evaluation
metrics, we use the marching cubes algorithm [29] to ex-
tract meshes from volumetric representations.

4.2. Recognition baselines

We implemented two straightforward baselines that ap-
proach the problem purely in terms of recognition. The ﬁrst
is based on clustering of the training shapes in conjunction
with an image classiﬁer; the second performs database re-
trieval.

Clustering. In this baseline, we cluster the training shapes
into K sub-categories using the K-means algorithm [31].
Since using 1283 voxelizations as feature vectors for clus-
tering is too costly, we run the algorithm on 323 voxeliza-
tions ﬂattened into a vector. Once the cluster assignments
are determined, we switch back to working with high-
resolution models.

Within each of the K clusters, we calculate the mean

shape as

ˆmk =

1
Nk

Nk

X

n=0

vn,

(1)

where vn is one of the Nk shapes belonging to the k-th clus-
ter. We threshold the mean shapes at τk, where the optimal
τk value is determined by maximizing the average IoU over
the models belonging to the k-th cluster:

τk = arg max

τ

1
Nk

Nk

n=0

IoU( ˆmk > τ, vn),

(2)

where the thresholding operation is applied per voxel. We
enumerate τ in the interval [0.05, 0.5] with a step size of
0.05 to ﬁnd the optimal threshold. We set K = 500.

Since correspondences between images and 3D shapes
are known for the training set,
images can be readily
matched with the respective cluster k. Subsequently, we

train a 1-of-K classiﬁer that assigns images to cluster labels.
At test time, we set the mean shape of the predicted clus-
ter as the inferred solution. For classiﬁcation, we use the
ResNet-50 architecture [14], pre-trained on the ImageNet
dataset [5], and ﬁne-tuned for 30 epochs on our data.

Retrieval. Our retrieval baseline is inspired by the work
of Li et al. [25], which learns to embed images and shapes
in a joint space. The embedding space is constructed from
the pairwise similarity matrix of all 3D shapes in the train-
ing set by compressing each row of the matrix to a low-
dimensional descriptor via Multi-Dimensional Scaling [24]
with Sammon mapping [39]. To compute the similarity of
two arbitrary shapes, Li et al. employ the lightﬁeld descrip-
tor [2]. To embed images in the space spanned by the shape
descriptors, a convolutional network [23] is trained to map
images to the descriptor given by the corresponding shape
in the training set. During training, the network optimizes
the Euclidean distance between predicted and ground-truth
descriptors.

We adapt the work of Li et al. in several ways. As with
our clustering baseline, we determine the similarity between
two shapes via the IoU of their 323 voxel grid representa-
tion. We then compute a low-dimensional descriptor via
principal component analysis. We further use a larger de-
scriptor (512 vs. 128) and a network with larger capacity
(ResNet-50 [14], pre-trained on ImageNet [5], without ﬁx-
ing any layers during ﬁne-tuning). Finally, instead of min-
imizing the Euclidean distance, we maximize the cosine
similarity between descriptors during training.

Oracle nearest neighbor. To gain more insight into the
characteristics of the dataset, we evaluate an Oracle Nearest
Neighbor (Oracle NN) baseline. For each of the test 3D
shapes, we ﬁnd the closest shape from the training set in
terms of IoU. This method cannot be applied in practice,
but gives an upper bound on how well a retrieval method
can solve the task.

4.3. Analysis

We start by conducting a standard comparison of all
methods in terms of their mean IoU scores. The results are
summarized in Fig. 2. We ﬁnd that state-of-the-art methods,
despite being backed by different architectures, perform at
a remarkably similar level. Interestingly, the retrieval base-
line, a pure recognition method, outperforms all other ap-
proaches both in terms of mean and median IoU. The simple
clustering baseline is competitive and outperforms both At-
lasNet and OGN. We further observe that a perfect retrieval
method (Oracle NN) performs signiﬁcantly better than all
other methods. Strikingly, the variance in the results is ex-
tremely high (between 35% and 50%) for all methods. This
implies that quantitative comparisons that rely solely on the
mean IoU do not provide a full picture at this level of perfor-
mance. To shed more light on the behavior of the methods,
we proceed with a more detailed analysis.

Per-class analysis. The similarity in average accuracy can-
not be attributed to methods specializing in different subsets
of classes. In Fig. 3 we observe consistent relative perfor-
mance between methods across different classes. The re-
trieval baseline achieves the best results for 30 out of 55
classes. The classes are sorted from left to right in ascend-
ing order according to the performance of the retrieval base-
line. The variance is high for all classes and all methods.

One might assume that the per-class performance de-
pends on the number of training samples that are available
for a class. However, we ﬁnd no correlation between the
number of samples in a class and its mean IoU score; see
Fig. 4. The correlation coefﬁcient between the two quanti-
ties is close to zero for all methods. This implies that there
is no justiﬁcation for only using 13 out of the 55 classes, as
was done in many prior works [4, 8, 12, 37, 46, 55].

The quantitative results are backed by qualitative results
shown in Fig. 5. For most classes, there is no signiﬁcant
visual difference between the predictions of the decoder-
based methods and our clustering baseline. Clustering fails
when the sample is far from the mean shape of the cluster,
or when the cluster itself cannot be described well by the
mean shape (this is often the case for chairs or tables be-
cause of thin structures that get averaged out in the mean
shape). The predictions of the retrieval baseline look more
appealing in most cases due to the presence of ﬁne details,
even though these details are not necessarily correct. We
provide additional qualitative results in the supplementary
material.

Statistical evaluation. To further investigate the hypothe-
sis that convolutional networks bypass true reconstruction
via image recognition, we visualize the histograms of IoU
scores for individual object classes in Fig. 6. For histograms
of all 55 classes we refer to the supplementary material. Al-
though the distributions differ between classes, the within-

retrieval baseline produces the best reconstructions for the majority of classes. The variance is high for all classes and methods.

ﬁnd no correlation between the number of samples within a class
and the mIoU score for this class. The correlation coefﬁcient c is

class distributions of decoder-based methods and recogni-
tion baselines are surprisingly similar.

For reference, we also plot the results of the Oracle
NN baseline, which, for many classes, differs substan-
tially. To verify this observation rigorously, we perform the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [32] on the 50-binned versions
of the histograms for all classes and all pairs of methods.
The null hypothesis assumes that two distributions exhibit
no statistically signiﬁcant difference. We visualize the re-
sults of the test in the rightmost part of Fig. 6. Every cell
of the heat map shows the number of classes for which the
statistical test does not allow to reject the null hypothesis,
i.e., where the p-value is larger than 0.05. We ﬁnd that
for decoder-based methods and recognition baselines the
null hypothesis cannot be rejected for the vast majority of
classes.

5. Problems

In the preceding section we provided evidence that cur-
rent methods for single-view 3D object reconstruction pre-
dominantly rely on recognition. Here we discuss aspects of
popular experimental procedures that may need to be recon-
sidered to elicit more detailed reconstruction behavior from
the models.

5.1. Choice of coordinate system

The vast majority of existing methods predict output
shapes in an object-centered coordinate system, which
aligns objects of the same semantic category to a common
orientation. Aligning objects this way makes it particularly
easy to ﬁnd spatial regularities.
It encourages learning-
based approaches to recognize the object category ﬁrst, and
reﬁne the shape later if at all.

Shin et al. [42] studied how the choice of coordinate
frames affects reconstruction performance and generaliza-
tion abilities of learning-based methods, comparing object-
centered and viewer-centered coordinate frames. They
found that a viewer-centered frame leads to signiﬁcantly
better generalization to object classes that were not seen
during training, a result that can only be achieved when a
method operates in a geometric reconstruction regime.

To validate these conclusions, we repeated the experi-
mental evaluation (Sec. 4) in a viewer-centered coordinate
frame. We attempted to extend the clustering baseline with
a viewpoint prediction network which would regress the az-
imuth and elevation angles of the camera w.r.t. the canoni-
cal frame. This naive approach failed because the canon-
ical frame has a different meaning for each object class,
implying that the viewpoint network needs to use class in-
formation in order to solve the task. For the retrieval base-
line, we retrained the method, treating each training view
as a separate sample. To avoid artifacts from rotating vox-
elized shapes, we synthesized ground-truth shapes by ro-
tating and then voxelizing the original meshes, resulting in

a distinct target shape for each view of each object. Re-
sults are shown in Fig. 7, where we observe a mild decrease
in performance for OGN and Matryoshka networks, and a
larger drop for the retrieval baseline. For the retrieval set-
ting, the viewer-centered setup is computationally more de-
manding, as different views of the same object now refer to
different shapes to be retrieved. Consequently, less learning

capacity is available for each individual object.

5.2. Evaluation metric

Intersection over union. The mean IoU is commonly
used as the primary quantitative measure for benchmarking
single-view reconstruction approaches. This can be prob-
lematic if it is used as the sole metric to argue for the merits
of an approach, since it is only indicative of the quality of a
predicted shape if it reaches sufﬁciently high values. Low to
mid-range scores indicate a signiﬁcant discrepancy between
two shapes.

An example is shown in Fig. 8, which compares a car
model to different shapes in the dataset and illustrates their
similarity in terms of IoU scores. As shown in the ﬁgure,
even an IoU of 0.59 allows for considerable deviation from
the ground-truth shape. For reference, note that 75% of
the predictions by the best performing approach, our re-
trieval baseline, have an IoU below 0.66; 50% are below
0.43 (c.f . Fig. 2).

Figure 9. The Chamfer distance is sensitive to outliers. Compared
to the source, both target shapes exhibit non-matching parts that
are equally wrong. While the F@1% is 0.56 for both shapes, the
Chamfer distance differs signiﬁcantly.

All information about an object’s shape is situated on its
surface. However, for voxel-based representations with a
solid interior, the IoU is dominated by the interior parts of
objects. As a consequence, even seemingly high IoU values
may poorly reﬂect the actual surface similarity.

Moreover, while IoU can easily be evaluated for a vol-
umetric representation, there is no straightforward way to
evaluate it for point clouds. A good measure should al-
low comparing different 3D representations within the same
uniﬁed framework. Point-based measures are most suit-
able for this, because a point cloud can be obtained from
any other 3D representation via (a) surface point sampling
for meshes, (b) per-pixel reprojection for depth maps, or
(c) running the marching cubes algorithm followed by point
sampling for voxel grids.

Chamfer distance. Some recent methods use the Cham-
fer Distance (CD) for evaluation [8, 12, 44]. Although it is
deﬁned on point clouds and by design satisﬁes the require-
ment of being applicable (after conversion) to different 3D
representations, it is a problematic measure because of its
sensitivity to outliers. Consider the example in Fig. 9. Both
target chairs perfectly match the source chair in the lower
part and are completely wrong in the upper part. However,
according to the CD score, the second target is much bet-
ter than the ﬁrst. As this example shows, the CD measure
can be signiﬁcantly perturbed by the geometric layout of
outliers. It is affected by how far the outliers are from the
reference shape. We argue that in order to reliably reﬂect
real reconstruction performance, a good quantitative mea-
sure should be robust to the detailed geometry of outliers.

F-score. Motivated by the insight that both IoU and CD

can be misleading, we propose to use the F-score [21], an
established and easily interpretable metric that is actively
used in the multi-view 3D reconstruction community. The
F-score explicitly evaluates the distance between object sur-
faces and is deﬁned as the harmonic mean between pre-
cision and recall. Precision measures the accuracy of the
reconstruction by counting the percentage of reconstructed
points that lie within a certain distance to the ground truth.
Recall measures the completeness of the reconstruction by
counting the percentage of points on the ground truth that
lie within a certain distance to the reconstruction. The strict-
ness of the F-score can be controlled by varying the distance
threshold d. The metric has an intuitive interpretation: the
percentage of points (or surface area) that was reconstructed
correctly.

We plot the F-score of viewer-centered reconstructions
for different distance thresholds d in Fig. 10 (left). At
d = 2% of the side length of the reconstructed volume, the
absolute F-score values are in the same range as the current
mIoU scores, which, as we argued before, is not indicative
of the prediction quality. We therefore suggest evaluating
the F-score at distance thresholds of 1% and below.

In Fig. 10 (right), we show the percentage of models with
an F-score of 0.5 or higher at a threshold d = 1%. Only a
small number of shapes is reconstructed accurately, indi-
cating that the task is still far from solved. Our retrieval
baseline is no longer a clear winner, further showing that
a reasonable solution in viewer-centered mode is harder to
get using a pure recognition method.

We observe that AtlasNet often produces qualitatively
good surfaces.
It even outperforms the Oracle NN base-
line on more liberal (above 2%) thresholds, as shown in
Fig. 10 (left). Perceptually, humans tend to judge quality
by global and semi-global features and tolerate if parts are
slightly wrong in position or shape. We observe that Atlas-
Net, which was trained to optimize surface correspondence,
rarely completely misses parts of the model, but tends to
produce poorly localized parts. This is reﬂected in the high-
performance range analysis, shown in Fig. 10 (right), where
AtlasNet trails all other approaches.

Analyzing precision and recall separately provides addi-
tional insights into each method’s behavior. In Fig. 11 we
see that OGN and Matryoshka Networks outperform Oracle
NN in terms of precision. However, both Oracle NN and

representative types, aligned to a canonical reference frame
– enables recognition models to masquerade as reconstruc-
tion. In Fig. 2, we demonstrate that a retrieval solution (Or-
acle NN) outperforms all other methods on this dataset, i.e.,
the test data can be explained by simply retrieving models
from the training set. This indicates a critical problem in
using ShapeNet to evaluate 3D reconstruction: for a typi-
cal shape in the test set, there is a very similar shape in the
training set. In effect, the train/test split is contaminated,
because so many shapes within a class are similar. A re-
construction model evaluated on ShapeNet does not need to
actually perform reconstruction: it merely needs to retrieve
a similar shape from the training set.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we reasoned about the spectrum of ap-
proaches to single-view 3D reconstruction, spanned by re-
construction and recognition. We introduced two baselines,
classiﬁcation and retrieval, which leverage only recogni-
tion. We showed that the simple retrieval baseline outper-
forms recent state-of-the-art methods. Our analysis indi-
cates that state-of-the-art approaches to single-view 3D re-
construction primarily perform recognition rather than re-
construction. We identify aspects of common experimental
procedures that elicit this behavior and make a number of
recommendations, including the use of a viewer-centered
coordinate frame and a robust and informative evaluation
measure (the F-score). Another critical problem, the dataset
composition, is identiﬁed but left unaddressed. We are
working towards remedying this in a subsequent work.

the retrieval baseline show higher recall. This is supported
by qualitative observations that OGN and Matryoshka Net-
works tend to produce incomplete models.

Both recall and precision can be easily visualized to gain

further insights, as illustrated in Fig. 12.
