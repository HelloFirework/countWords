Abstract

Input

Output

Computed tomography (CT) can provide a 3D view of the
patient’s internal organs, facilitating disease diagnosis, but
it incurs more radiation dose to a patient and a CT scan-
ner is much more cost prohibitive than an X-ray machine
too. Traditional CT reconstruction methods require hun-
dreds of X-ray projections through a full rotational scan of
the body, which cannot be performed on a typical X-ray ma-
chine. In this work, we propose to reconstruct CT from two
orthogonal X-rays using the generative adversarial network
(GAN) framework. A specially designed generator network
is exploited to increase data dimension from 2D (X-rays)
to 3D (CT), which is not addressed in previous research of
GAN. A novel feature fusion method is proposed to com-
bine information from two X-rays. The mean squared error
(MSE) loss and adversarial loss are combined to train the
generator, resulting in a high-quality CT volume both visu-
ally and quantitatively. Extensive experiments on a publicly
available chest CT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. It could be a nice enhancement of a
low-cost X-ray machine to provide physicians a CT-like 3D
volume in several niche applications.

1. Introduction

Immediately after its discovery by Wilhelm Rntgen in
1895, X-ray found wide applications in clinical practice. It
is the ﬁrst imaging modality enabling us to non-invasively
see through a human body and diagnose changes of internal
anatomies. However, all tissues are projected onto a 2D im-
age, overlaying each other. While bones are clearly visible,
soft tissues are often difﬁcult to discern. Computed tomog-
raphy (CT) is an imaging modality that reconstructs a 3D
volume from a set of X-rays (usually, at least 100 images)
captured in a full rotation of the X-ray apparatus around
the body. One prominent advantage of CT is that tissues

are presented in the 3D space, which completely solves the
overlaying issue. However, a CT scan incurs far more radi-
ation dose to a patient (depending on the number of X-rays
acquired for CT reconstruction). Moreover, a CT scanner
is often much more cost prohibitive than an X-ray machine,
making its less accessible in developing countries [37].

With hundreds of X-ray projections, standard recon-
struction algorithms, e.g., ﬁltered back projection or itera-
tive reconstruction, can accurately reconstruct a CT volume
[14]. However, the data acquisition requires a fast rotation
of the X-ray apparatus around the patient, which cannot be
performed on a typical X-ray machine.
In this work, we
propose to reconstruct a CT volume from biplanar X-rays
that are captured from two orthogonal view planes. The
major challenge is that the X-ray image suffers from severe
ambiguity of internal body information, where numbers of
CT volumes can exactly match the same input X-rays once
projected onto 2D. It seems to be unsolvable if we look for
general solutions with traditional CT reconstruction algo-
rithms. However, human body anatomy is well constrained
and we may be able to learn the mapping from X-rays to
CT from a large training set through machine learning tech-
nology, especially deep learning (DL) methods. Recently,
the generative adversarial network (GAN) [11] has been

10619

used for cross-modality image transfer in medical imag-
ing [3, 5, 30, 39] and has demonstrated the effectiveness.
However, the previous works only deal with the input and
output data having the same dimension. Here we propose
X2CT-GAN that can reconstruct CT from biplanar X-rays,
surpassing the data limitations of different modalities and
dimensionality (Fig. 1).

The purpose of this work is not to replace CT with X-
rays. Though the proposed method can reconstruct the gen-
eral structure accurately, small anatomies still suffer from
some artifacts. However, the proposed method may ﬁnd
some niche applications in clinical practice. For example,
we can measure the size of major organs (e.g., lungs, heart,
and liver) accurately, or diagnose ill-positioned organs on
the reconstructed CT scan.
It may also be used for dose
planning in radiation therapy, or pre-operative planning and
intra-operative guidance in minimally invasive intervention.
It could be a nice enhancement of a low-cost X-ray machine
as physicians may also get a CT-like 3D volume that has
certain clinical values.

Though the proposed network can also be used to recon-
struct CT from a single X-ray, we argue that using bipla-
nar X-rays is a more practical solution. First, CT recon-
struction from a single X-ray subjects to too much ambigu-
ity while biplanar X-rays offer additional information from
both views that is complementary to each other. More accu-
rate results, 4 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR), are achieved in our comparison experiment. Sec-
ond, biplanar X-ray machines are already clinically avail-
able, which can capture two orthogonal X-ray images si-
multaneously. And, it is also clinically practicable to cap-
ture two orthogonal X-rays with a mono-planar machine,
by rotating the X-ray apparatus to a new orientation for the
second X-ray imaging.

One practical issue to train X2CT-GAN is lacking of
paired X-ray and CT 1. It is expensive to collect such paired
data from patients and it is also unethical to subject patients
to additional radiation doses. In this work, we train the net-
work with synthesized X-rays generated from large public-
available chest CT datasets [1]. Given a CT volume, we
simulate two X-rays, one from the posterior-anterior (PA)
view and the other from the lateral view, using the digi-
tally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) technology [28]. Al-
though DRR synthesized X-rays are quite photo-realistic,
there still exits a gap between real and synthesized X-rays,
especially in ﬁner anatomy structures, e.g., blood vessels.
Therefore we further resort CycleGAN [41] to learn the
genuine X-ray style that can be transferred to the synthe-
sized data. More information about the style transfer oper-
ation can be found in supplement materials.

1Sometimes X-rays are captured as topogram before a CT scan. How-
ever, without the calibrated back-projection matrix, we cannot perfectly
align the two modalities.

To summarize, we make the following contributions:

• We are the ﬁrst to explore CT reconstruction from bi-
planar X-rays with deep learning. To fully utilize the
input information from two different views, a novel
feature fusion method is proposed.

• We propose X2CT-GAN, as illustrated in Fig. 2, to
increase the data dimension from input to output (i.e.,
2D X-ray to 3D CT), which is not addressed in previ-
ous research on GAN.

• We propose a novel skip connection module that could

bridge 2D and 3D feature maps more naturally.

• We use synthesized X-rays to learn the mapping from
2D to 3D, and CycleGAN to transfer real X-rays to
the synthesized style before feeding into the network.
Therefore, although our network is trained with syn-
thesized X-rays, it can still reconstruct CT from real
X-rays.

• Compared to other reconstruction algorithms using
visible light [7, 9, 18], our X-ray based approach can
reconstruct both surface and internal structures.

2. Related Work

Cross-Modality Transfer A DL based model often suf-
fers from lacking enough training data so as to fall into a
suboptimal point during training or even overﬁt the small
dataset. To alleviate this problem, synthetic data has been
used to boost the training process [33, 39]. So synthesiz-
ing realistic images close to the target distribution is a critic
premise. Previous research such as pix2pix [17] could do
the pixel level image to image transfer and CycleGAN [41]
has the ability to learn the mapping between two unpaired
datasets. In medical imaging community, quite some efforts
have been put into this area to transfer a source modality to
a target modality, e.g., 3T MRI to 7T MRI [3], MRI to CT
[5, 30], MRI and CT bidirectional transfer [39] etc. Our
approach differs from the previous cross-modality transfer
works in two ways. First, in all the above works, the di-
mensions of the input and output are consistent, e.g., 2D to

2D or 3D to 3D. Here, we want to transfer 2D X-rays to a
3D volume. To handle this challenge, we propose X2CT-
GAN, which incorporates two mechanisms to increase the
data dimension. Second, our goal is to reconstruct accurate
3D anatomy from biplanar X-rays with clinical values in-
stead of enriching the training set. A photo-realistic image
(e.g., one generated from pure noise input [11]) may already
be beneﬁcial for training. However, our application further
requires the image to be anatomically accurate as well.

3D Model Extraction from 2D Projections 3D model
extraction from 2D projections is a well studied topic in
computer vision [7, 9, 18]. Since most objects are opaque
to light, only the outer surface model can be reconstructed.
X-ray can penetrate most objects (except thick metal) and
different structures overlay on a 2D image. Therefore, the
methods used in 3D model extraction from X-rays are quite
different to those used in the computer vision community.
Early in 1990, Caponetti and Fanelli reconstructed a bone
model from two X-rays based on back-lighting projections,
polygon mesh and B-spline interpolation [6].
In recent
years, several works have investigated the reconstruction of
bones, rib cages and lungs through statistical shape models
or other prior knowledge [8, 2, 19, 24, 21, 23, 22]. Different
to ours, these methods could not generate a 3D CT-like im-
age. Furthermore, although they may be able to get precise

models, if we generalize these to reconstruct other organs,
an elaborate geometric model has to be prepared in advance,
which limits their application scenarios.

CT Reconstruction from X-ray Classical CT recon-
struction algorithms, e.g., ﬁltered back projection and it-
erative reconstruction methods [14], require hundreds of
X-rays captured during a full rotational scan of the body.
Methods based on deep learning have also been used to im-
prove the performance in recent works [38, 12]. The input
of [38] is an X-ray sinogram, while ours are human readable
biplanar X-rays. And, [12] mainly deals with the limited-
angle CT compensation problem. More relevant to our work
is [13], which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
predict the underlying 3D object as a volume from a single-
image tomography. However, we argue that a single X-ray
is not enough to accurately reconstruct 3D anatomy since
it is subject to too much ambiguity. For example, we can
stretch or ﬂip an object along the projection direction with-
out changing the projected image. As shown in our experi-
ments, biplanar X-rays with two orthogonal projections can
signiﬁcantly improve the reconstruction accuracy, beneﬁt-
ing from more constraints provided by an additional view.
Furthermore, the images reconstructed by [13] are quite
blurry, thus with limited clinical values. Combining adver-
sarial training and reconstruction constraints, our method

10621

could extract much ﬁner anatomical structures (e.g. blood
vessels inside lungs), which signiﬁcantly improves the vi-
sual quality.

3. Objective Functions of X2CT-GAN

GAN [11] is a recent proposal to effectively train a gen-
erative model that has demonstrated the ability to capture
real data distribution. Conditional GAN [29], as an exten-
sion of the original GAN, further improves the data gener-
ation process by conditioning the generative model on ad-
ditional inputs, which could be class labels, partial data, or
even data from a different modality. Inspired by the suc-
cesses of conditional GANs, we propose a novel solution
to train a generative model that can reconstruct a 3D CT
volume from biplanar 2D X-rays. In this section, we ﬁrst
introduce several loss functions that are used to constrain
the generative model.

3.1. Adversarial Loss

The original intention of GAN is to learn deep genera-
tive models while avoiding approximating many intractable
probabilistic computations that arise in other strategies, i.e.,
maximum likelihood estimation. The learning procedure is
a two-player game, where a discriminator D and a genera-
tor G would compete with each other. The ultimate goal is
to learn a generator distribution pG(x) that matches the real
data distribution pdata(x). An ideal generator could gener-
ate samples that are indistinguishable from the real samples
by the discriminator. More formally, the minmax game is
summarized by the following expression:

min

G

max

D

V (G, D) =Ex∼pdata [log D(x)]+

(1)

Ez∼noise[log (1 − D(G(z)))],

where z is sampled from a noise distribution.

As we want to learn a non-linear mapping from X-rays to
CT, the generated CT volume should be consistent with the
semantic information provided by the input X-rays. After
trying different mutants of the conditional GAN, we ﬁnd out
that LSGAN [27] is more suitable for our task and apply it
to guide the training process. The conditional LSGAN loss
is deﬁned as:

LLSGAN (D) =

LLSGAN (G) =

1
2

1
2

[E

y∼p(CT )(D(y|x) − 1)2+

E

x∼p(Xray)(D(G(x)|x) − 0)2],

(2)

[E

x∼p(Xray)(D(G(x)|x) − 1)2],

where x is composed of two orthogonal biplanar X-
rays, and y is the corresponding CT volume. Compared
to the original objective function deﬁned in Eq. (1), LS-
GAN replaces the logarithmic loss with a least-square loss,
which helps to stabilize the adversarial training process and
achieve more realistic details.

3.2. Reconstruction Loss

The conditional adversarial loss tries to make prediction
look real. However, it does not guarantee that G can gener-
ate a sample maintaining the structural consistency with the
input. Moreover, CT scans, different from natural images
that have more diversity in color and shape, require higher
precision of internal structures in 3D. Consequently, an ad-
ditional constraint is required to enforce the reconstructed
CT to be voxel-wise close to the ground truth. Some pre-
vious work has combined the reconstruction loss [32] with
the adversarial loss and got positive improvements. We also
follow this strategy and acquire a high PSNR as shown in
Table 1. Our reconstruction loss is deﬁned as MSE:

Lre = Ex,yky − G(x)k2
2.

(3)

3.3. Projection Loss

The aforementioned reconstruction loss is a voxel-wise
loss that enforces the structural consistency in the 3D space.
To improve the training efﬁciency, more simple shape pri-
ors could be utilized as auxiliary regularizations. Inspired
by [18], we impel 2D projections of the predicted volume to
match the ones from corresponding ground-truth in differ-
ent views. Orthogonal projections, instead of perspective
projections, are carried out to simplify the process as this
auxiliary loss focuses only on the general shape consistency,
not the X-ray veracity. We choose three orthogonal projec-
tion planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal, as shown in Fig.
2, following the convention in the medical imaging com-
munity). Finally, the proposed projection loss is deﬁned as
below:

Lpl =

1
3

[Ex,ykPax(y) − Pax(G(x))k1+

Ex,ykPco(y) − Pco(G(x))k1+
Ex,ykpsa(y) − Psa(G(x))k1],

(4)

where the Pax, Pco and Psa represent the projection in the
axial, coronal, and sagittal plane, respectively. The L1 dis-
tance is used to enforce sharper image boundaries.

3.4. Total Objective

Given the deﬁnitions of the adversarial loss, reconstruc-
tion loss, and projection loss, our ﬁnal objective function is
formulated as:

D∗ = arg min

D
G∗ = arg min

G

λ1LLSGAN (D),

[λ1LLSGAN (G) + λ2Lre + λ3Lpl],

(5)

where λ1, λ2 and λ3 control the relative importance of
different loss terms.
In our X-ray to CT reconstruction
task, the adversarial loss plays an important role of encour-
aging local realism of the synthesized output, but global

10622

shape consistency should be prioritized during the opti-
mization process. Taking this into consideration, we set
λ1 = 0.1, λ2 = λ3 = 10 in our experiments.

4. Network Architecture of X2CT-GAN

In this section, we introduce our proposed network de-
signs that are used in the 3D CT reconstruction task from
2D biplanar X-rays. Similar to other 3D GAN architectures,
our method involves a 3D generator and a 3D discriminator.
These two models are alternatively trained with the super-
vision deﬁned in previous section.

4.1. Generator

(a) Connection-A

(b) Connection-B

(c) Connection-C

The proposed 3D generator, as illustrated in Fig. 3, con-
sists of three individual components: two encoder-decoder
networks with the same architecture working in parallel for
posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays respectively, and a
fusion network. The encoder-decoder network aims to learn
the mapping from the input 2D X-ray to the target 3D CT in
the feature space, and the fusion network is responsible for
reconstructing the 3D CT volume with the fused biplanar
information from the two encoder-decoder networks. Since
the training process in our reconstruction task involves cir-
culating information between input and output from two
different modalities and dimensionalities, several modiﬁca-
tions of the network architecture are made to adapt to the
challenge.

Densely Connected Encoder Dense connectivity [15]
has a compelling advantage in the feature extraction pro-
cess. To optimally utilize information from 2D X-ray im-
ages, we embed dense modules to generator’s encoding
path. As shown in Fig. 3, each dense module consists
of a down-sampling block (2D convolution with stride=2),
a densely connected convolution block and a compressing
block (output channels halved). The cascaded dense mod-
ules encode different level information of the input image
and pass it to the decoder along different shortcut paths.

Bridging 2D Encoder and 3D Decoder Some existing
encoder-decoder networks [17, 25] link encoder and de-
coder by means of convolution. There is no obstacle in a
pure 2D or 3D encode-decode process, but our special 2D
to 3D mapping procedure requires a new design to bridge
the information from two dimensionalities. Motivated by
[40], we extend fully connected layer to a new connec-
tion module, named Connection-A (Fig. 4a), to bridge the
2D encoder and 3D decoder in the middle of our genera-
tor. To better utilize skip connections in the 2D-3D gen-
erator, we design another novel connection module, named
Connection-B (Fig. 4b), to shuttle low-level features from
encoder to decoder.

To be more speciﬁc, Connection-A achieves the 2D-3D
conversion through fully-connected layers, where the last
encoder layer’s output is ﬂattened and elongated to a 1D

Connection-B aim to increase dimensionality of feature maps, and
Connection-C is for fusing information from two different views.

vector that is further reshaped to 3D. However, most of the
2D spatial information gets lost during such conversion so
that we only use Connection-A to link the last encoder layer
and ﬁrst decoder layer. For the rest of skip connections, we
use Connection-B and take following steps: 1) enforce the
channel number of the encoder being equal to the one on
the corresponding decoder side by a basic 2D convolution
block; 2) expand the 2D feature map to a pseudo-3D one
by duplicating the 2D information along the third axis; 3)
use a basic 3D convolution block to encode the pseudo-3D
feature map. The abundant low-level information shuttled
across two parts of the network imposes strong correlations
on the shape and appearance between input and output.

Feature Fusion of Biplanar X-rays As a common
sense, a 2D photograph from frontal view could not retain
lateral information of the object and vice versa. In our task,
we resort biplanar X-rays captured from two orthogonal di-
rections, where the complementary information could help
the generative model achieve more accurate results. Two
encoder-decoder networks in parallel extract features from
each view while the third decoder network is set to fuse the
extracted information and output the reconstructed volume.
As we assume the biplanar X-rays are captured within a
negligible time interval, meaning no data shift caused by pa-
tient motions, we can directly average the extracted features
after transforming them into the same coordinate space, as
shown in Fig. 4c. Any structural inconsistency between
two decoders’ outputs will be captured by the fusion net-
work and back-propagated to two networks.

4.2. Discriminator

PatchGANs have been used frequently in recent works
[26, 17, 25, 41, 35] due to the good generalization prop-
erty. We adopt a similar architecture in our discriminator
network from Phillip et al. [17], named as 3DPatchDis-

10623

It consists of three conv3d − norm − relu
criminator.
modules with stride = 2 and kernelsize = 4, another
conv3d − norm − relu module with stride = 1 and
kernelsize = 4, and a ﬁnal conv3d layer. Here, conv3d
denotes a 3D convolution layer; norm stands for an in-
stance normalization layer [34]; and relu represents a rec-
tiﬁed linear unit [10]. The proposed discriminator architec-
ture improves the discriminative capacity inherited from the
PatchGAN framework and can distinguish real or fake 3D
volumes.

4.3. Training and Inference Details

The generator and discriminator are trained alternatively
following the standard process [11]. We use the Adam
solver [20] to train our networks. The initial learning rate
of Adam is 2e-4, momentum parameters β1 = 0.5 and
β2 = 0.99. After training 50 epochs, we adopt a linear
learning rate decay policy to decrease the learning rate to 0.
We train our model for a total of 100 epochs.

As instance normalization [34] has been demonstrated to
be superior to batch normalization [16] in image generation
tasks, we use instance normalization to regularize interme-
diate feature maps of our generator. At inference time, we
observe that better generating results could be obtained if
we use the statistics of the test batch itself instead of the
running average of training batches, as suggested in [17].
Constrained by GPU memory limit, the batch size is set to
one in all our experiments.

5. Experiments

In this section, we introduce an augmented dataset built
on LIDC-IDRI [1]. We evaluate the proposed X2CT-GAN
model with several widely used metrics, e.g., peak signal-
to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) in-
dex. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we
reproduce a baseline model named 2DCNN [13]. Fair com-
parisons and comprehensive analysis are given to demon-
strate the improvement of our proposed method over the
baseline and other mutants. Finally, we show the real-world
X-ray evaluation results of X2CT-GAN. Input images to
X2CT-GAN are resized to 128 × 128 pixels, while the input
of 2DCNN is 256 × 256 pixels as suggested by [13]. The
output of all models is set to 128 × 128 × 128 voxels.

5.1. Datasets

CT and X-ray Paired Dataset Ideally, to train and val-
idate the proposed CT reconstruction approach, we need a
large dataset with paired X-rays and corresponding CT re-
constructions. Furthermore, the X-ray machine needs to be
calibrated to get an accurate projection matrix. However, no
such dataset is available and it is very costly to collect such
real paired dataset. Therefore, we take a real CT volume

and use the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) tech-
nology [28] to synthesize corresponding X-rays, as shown
in Fig. 5. It is much cheaper to collect such synthesized
datasets to train our networks. To be speciﬁc, we use the
publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset [1], which contains
1,018 chest CT scans. The heterogeneous of imaging pro-
tocols result in different capture ranges and resolutions. For
example, the number of slices varies a lot for different vol-
umes. The resolution inside a slice is isotropic but also
varies for different volumes. All these factors lead to a non-
trivial reconstruction task from 2D X-rays. To simplify, we
ﬁrst resample the CT scans to the 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 resolu-
tion. Then, a 320 × 320 × 320 mm3 cubic area is cropped
from each CT scan. We randomly select 916 CT scans for
training and the rest 102 CT scans are used for testing.

Mapping from Real to Synthetic X-rays Although
DRR synthetic X-rays are quite photo-realistic, there is still
a gap between the real and synthetic X-rays, especially
for those subtle anatomical structures, e.g., blood vessels.
Since our networks are trained with synthesized X-rays, a
sub-optimal result will be obtained if we directly feed a real
X-ray into the network. We propose to perform style trans-
fer to map real X-rays to the synthesized style. Without
paired dataset of real and synthesized X-rays, we exploit
CycleGAN [41] to learn the mapping. We collected 200 real
X-rays and randomly selected 200 synthetic X-rays from
the training set of the paired LIDC dataset.

5.2. Metrics

PSNR is often used to measure the quality of recon-
structed digital signals [31]. Conventionally, CT value is
recorded with 12 bits, representing a range of [0, 4095]
(the actual Hounsﬁeld unit equals the CT value minus 1024)
[4], which makes PSNR an ideal criterion for image quality
evaluation.

SSIM is a metric to measure the similarity of two
images, including brightness, contrast and structure [36].
Compared to PSNR, SSIM can match human’s subjective
evaluation better.

5.3. Qualitative Results

We ﬁrst qualitatively evaluate CT reconstruction results
shown in Fig. 6, where X2CT-CNN is the proposed network

Figure 6. Reconstructed CT scans from different approaches. 2DCNN is our reproduced baseline model [13]; X2CT-CNN is our generator
network optimized by the MSE loss alone and X2CT-GAN is our GAN-based model optimized by total objective. ‘+S’ means single-view
X-ray input and ‘+B’ means biplanar X-rays input. The ﬁrst row demonstrates axial slices generated by different models. The last two
rows are 3D renderings of generated CT scans in the PA and lateral view, respectively.

supervised only by the reconstruction loss while X2CT-
GAN is the one trained with full objectives; ‘+S’ means
single-view X-ray input and ‘+B’ means biplanar X-rays
input. For comparison, we also reproduce the method pro-
posed in [13] (referred as 2DCNN in Fig. 6) as the base-
line, one of very few published works tackling the X-ray
to CT reconstruction problem using deep learning. Since
2DCNN is designed to deal with single X-ray input, no bi-
planar results are shown. From the visual quality evalua-
tion, it is obvious to see the differences. First of all, 2DCNN
and X2CT-CNN generate very blurry volumes while X2CT-
GAN maintains small anatomical structures. Secondly,
though missing reconstruction details, X2CT-CNN+S gen-
erates sharper boundaries of large organs (e.g., heart, lungs
and chest wall) than 2DCNN. Last but not least, models
trained with biplanar X-rays outperform the ones trained
with single view X-ray. More reconstructed CT slices could
be found in Fig. 8.

5.4. Quantitative Results

Quantitative results are summarized in Table 1. Biplanar
inputs signiﬁcantly improve the reconstruction accuracy,
about 4 dB improvement for both X2CT-CNN and X2CT-
GAN, compared to single X-ray input.
It is well known
that the GAN models often sacriﬁce MSE-based metrics to
achieve visually better results. This phenomenon is also ob-
served here. However, by tuning the relative weights of the
voxel-level MSE loss and semantic-level adversarial loss

from [13]; X2CT-CNN is our generator network optimized by the
MSE loss alone; and X2CT-GAN is our GAN-based model opti-
mized by total objective. ‘+S’ means single-view X-ray input and
‘+B’ means biplanar X-rays input.

is our cost function, we can make a reasonable trade-off.
For example, there is only 1.1 dB decrease in PSNR from
X2CT-CNN+B to X2CT-GAN+B, while the visual image
quality is dramatically improved as shown in Fig. 6. We ar-
gue that visual image quality is as important as (if not more
important than) PSNR in CT reconstruction since eventu-
ally the images will be read visually by a physician.

5.5. Ablation Study

Analysis of Proposed Connection Modules To validate
the effectiveness of proposed connection modules, we also
perform an ablation study in the setting of X2CT-CNN.
As shown in Table 2, single view input with Connection-
B achieves 0.7 dB improvement in PSNR. The biplanar

input, even without skip connections, surpasses the single
view due to the complementary information injected to the
network. And in our biplanar model, Connection-B and
Connection-C are interdependent so that we regard them
as one module. As can be seen, the biplanar model with
this module surpasses other combinations by a large margin
both in PSNR and SSIM.

Different Settings in GAN Framework The effects of
different settings in the GAN framework are summarized in
Table 3. As the ﬁrst row shows, adversarial loss alone per-
forms poorly on PSNR and SSIM due to the lack of strong
constraints. The most signiﬁcant improvement comes from
the reconstruction loss being added to the GAN framework.
Projection loss and the conditional information bring addi-
tional improvement slightly.

5.6. Real World Data Evaluation

Since the ultimate goal is to reconstruct a CT scan from
real X-rays, we ﬁnally evaluate our model on real-world
data, despite the model is trained on synthetic data. As we
have no corresponding 3D CT volumes for real X-rays, only
qualitative evaluation is conducted. Visual results are pre-
sented in Fig. 7, we could see that the reconstructed lung
and surface structures are quite plausible.

ing groundtruth (b). As could be seen, our method reconstructs the
shape and appearance of major anatomical structures accurately.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we explored the possibility of reconstruct-
ing a 3D CT scan from biplanar 2D X-rays in an end-to-
end fashion. To solve this challenging task, we combined
the reconstruction loss, the projection loss and the adver-
sarial loss in the GAN framework. Moreover, a specially
designed generator network is exploited to increase the data
dimension from 2D to 3D. Our experiments qualitatively
and quantitatively demonstrate that biplanar X-rays are su-
perior to single view X-ray in the 3D reconstruction process.
For future work, we will collaborate physicians to evaluate
the clinical value of the reconstructed CT scans, including
measuring the size of major organs and dose planning in
radiation therapy, etc.
