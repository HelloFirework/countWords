Abstract

Visual object recognition under situations in which the
direct line-of-sight is blocked, such as when it is occluded
around the corner, is of practical importance in a wide
range of applications. With coherent illumination, the light
scattered from diffusive walls forms speckle patterns that
contain information of the hidden object.
It is possible
to realize non-line-of-sight (NLOS) recognition with these
speckle patterns. We introduce a novel approach based
on speckle pattern recognition with deep neural network,
which is simpler and more robust than other NLOS recogni-
tion methods. Simulations and experiments are performed
to verify the feasibility and performance of this approach.

1. Introduction

Object recognition is essential for various applications
such as face recognition,
industrial inspection, medical
imaging, and autonomous driving. One intriguing area of
research is the recognition of objects without direct line-of-
sight [1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 19, 20, 27, 28, 39]. The ability to
carry out recognition without line-of-sight has practical sig-
niﬁcance; for example, in autonomous driving, if the imag-
ing system can recognize pedestrians and vehicles that are
“hidden” around the corner or behind other obstacles, the
vehicle can prevent potential hazards and greatly increase
the safety level of driving.

In this paper, we report an approach to perform recog-
nition without direct line-of-sight by exploiting the coher-
ent light. Objects illuminated by coherent light sources
such as lasers form speckle patterns due to interference.
In a non-line-of-sight situation, for example, as shown
in Figure 1, the object itself is occluded from the cam-

era; however, the speckle patterns on the wall are a re-
sult of the interference of light scattered owing to the ob-
ject [2, 15, 18, 23, 29, 32, 35, 36, 38, 41]. The informa-
tion in these patterns is not obvious to a human, but with an
appropriate deep network, one can retrieve the information
necessary to identify the object. Compared to current com-
puter vision algorithms that are primarily based on direct
visual images, this approach is applicable to a wide range
of situations in which visual images of the objects cannot
be obtained.

Our primary contribution is a novel NLOS object recog-
nition method that uses the information contained in speckle
patterns under coherent illumination. We use this method to
realize direct recognition of object without line-of-sight by
employing inexpensive electronic devices. In addition to the

11737

simplest situation of scattering from one diffusive wall, we
demonstrate the feasibility of this method in several more
challenging scenarios: (1) when the light source and the
camera locate at the same side so that neither of them has
direct line-of-sight with the object; this allows for wider ap-
plication of our method in which the object space is not
accessible; (2) when the wall is randomly rotated after each
measurement; this shows that our method is independent of
the speciﬁc textures of the wall and is robust; (3) when there
are two scatterings from two diffusive walls before the light
reaches the camera; this shows the potential of our method
to allow multiple scatterings in a complex scene.

We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our pre-
liminary setups using both experiments and simulations on
hand-written digits (MNIST) as well as much more com-
plex visual objects (human body posture) in the aforemen-
tioned scenarios. We demonstrate recognition accuracy of
over 90% with MNIST dataset under various experimental
and simulation conditions. For human body posture dataset,
an accuracy of 78.18% is achieved for classiﬁcation of 10
body posture categories, higher than the three-way classiﬁ-
cation result of body posture reported in [30].

2. Related Work

Recently, a few interesting works have demonstrated the
formation of images of objects that are without direct line-
of-sight. These methods overcome the traditional limita-
tions of imaging optics, which cannot form clear images in
the absence of direct line-of-sight conditions. These experi-
ments are usually extensive, requiring non-traditional mea-
surement of light, for example, by measuring time-of-ﬂight
(TOF) or in a setup that preserves the memory effect. How-
ever, imaging is not always needed for recognition. To per-
form imaging without line-of-sight, one would require ex-
pensive hardware and suffer from practical limitations such
as a narrow ﬁeld-of-view.
In this study, we perform di-
rect recognition without imaging the object. This aspect
allows our method to overcome some of the critical prac-
tical limitations of the related imaging methods. The pro-
posed method requires hardware (mostly consumer-grade
electronics) that is far less expensive than that required for
the TOF-based NLOS imaging [16, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, 37,
39, 40], and the method is more robust than the memory-
effect based imaging techniques that have a limited ﬁeld-of-
view [11, 21]. Moreover, a recent publication [31] also uses
only ordinal digital cameras but would require very speciﬁc
scene setup (an accidental occlusion) to obtain better per-
formance.

2.1. Imaging Based on Time of Flight

NLOS imaging with TOF has recently received consid-
erable attention. It is a range imaging system that resolves
the distance based on measuring the TOF of a light signal

between the object and the camera for each point of the im-
age. The mechanism of TOF measurement without line-
of-sight is as follows [39]: A laser pulse hits a wall that
scatters the light diffusely to a hidden object; then, the light
returns to the wall and is captured by a camera. By chang-
ing the position of the laser beam on the wall with a set
of galvanometer-actuated mirrors, the shape of the hidden
object can be determined.

Although TOF measurements without line-of-sight can
recover the hidden object with an accuracy of the order of
centimeters, it has some disadvantages. For example, it
requires substantial resources such as single-photon detec-
tors and nanosecond-pulsed lasers, which could cost tens
of thousands of dollars. In contrast, our method only uses
standard lasers and CMOS image sensors, which cost only
some thousands of dollars. TOF also takes minutes for data
acquisition and image reconstruction, while our approach
is only a single-shot measurement that takes less than one
second.

2.2. Imaging Based on Speckle Correlation (Mem 

ory Effect)

Imaging via speckle correlation is another method that
was recently developed. When a rough surface is illumi-
nated by a coherent light (e.g., a laser beam), a speckle pat-
tern is observed in the image plane. The key principle of this
method is that the auto-correlation of the speckle pattern is
essentially identical to the original object’s auto-correlation,
as if it is imaged by a perfect diffraction-limited optical sys-
tem that has replaced the scattering medium. Consequently,
the object’s image can be obtained from its auto-correlation
by an iterative phase retrieval algorithm [17]. In particu-
lar, for seeing without line-of-sight, the light back-scattered
from a diffusive wall is used to image the hidden objects.

For this method to work, the auto-correlation must be
preserved, which limits the ﬁeld-of-view. To use auto-
correlation to recover an image, the image must be very
sparse. Compared to this imaging technique, our approach
is more robust. It does not depend on the scattering prop-
erty of the wall and a single neural network can be trained
to work for many different types of walls. It also does not
require the object to be sparse, and there is no limit on the
ﬁeld-of-view.

2.3. Imaging Based on Holographic Approach

In 2014, Singh et al. proposed a holographic approach
for visualizing objects without line-of-sight, based on the
numerical reconstruction of 3D objects by digital hologra-
phy in which a hologram is formed on a reﬂectively scat-
tering surface [34]. A coherent light source is divided into
two parts: One beam illuminates the object, while the other
is set as the reference beam. The interference between the
two beams forms an aerial hologram immediately in front of

11738

the scattering surface. Then, the hologram is recorded by a
remote digital camera that focuses on the scattering surface.
This holographic technique requires a reference beam for
holographic recording, which is particularly challenging to
implement in practical scenarios.

3. Method

3.1. Preliminary Knowledge

Light carries information in terms of not only inten-
sity but also phase, frequency, and polarization, among
other factors. Traditional imaging techniques utilize only
the intensity information by using photon-electron conver-
sion through active semiconductor materials. Ordinary light
sources emit incoherent light; therefore, the phase of each
wave packet is random, and it cannot be used to retrieve
scene information. Considering an object with two points
reﬂecting incoherent light, the total intensity I at the image
plane is the sum of the intensity of the two point sources I1
and I2, and the phase information is effectively lost:

I = I1 + I2.

(1)

The light emitted by coherent light sources such as lasers
can form interference patterns. The total intensity with co-
herent illumination contains a phase term, which is a func-
tion of the phase difference ∆φ; it is highly dependent on
the relative locations of the two point sources, and results in
interference patterns [10]:

I = I1 + I2 + 2pI1I2 · cos ∆φ.

(2)

An object illuminated by either incoherent or coherent
light can be considered as a secondary light source. For
incoherent light, a pixel at location ~r on the image plane
captures light from all over the object:

I(~r) = Z (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

E( ~R, ~r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

· d ~R,

(3)

where E( ~R, ~r) is the amplitude distribution at the image
plane from a point source located at ~R on the object. The
phase variation of different pathways does not affect the in-
tensity. Traditional imaging approaches using incoherent
light therefore do not utilize the phase information of light.
Without direct line-of-sight to perform imaging, the object
can hardly be recognized under incoherent illumination.

For coherent light, the light intensity is given by

I(~r) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Re(cid:20)Z E( ~R, ~r) · exp(iφ( ~R, ~r)) · d ~R(cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where φ( ~R, ~r) is the phase variation at the image plane
from a point source located at ~R on the object, which is

2

,

(4)

highly dependent on the object geometry and its location
with respect to the image plane. Objects with a complex
surface geometry at the wavelength scale therefore generate
complex, seemingly random interference patterns I(~r) —
more speciﬁcally, speckle patterns, a term commonly used
in laser studies. The phase information is represented by the
bright and dark distributions of light intensity in the speckle
pattern. Therefore, the speckle pattern I(~r) contains infor-
mation of the object, and an appropriate deep learning net-
work can effectively use such information to perform object
recognition.

Figure 2. Speckle patterns of hand-written digits from simulation.
The images in the top row are original images of hand-written dig-
its from the MNIST dataset, and the images in the bottom row are
speckle patterns corresponding to the digits in the top row.

Consider the example of the MNIST hand-written dig-
its. Speckle images of several different hand-written digits
are shown in Figure 2. As described in Equation 4, each
point on a hand-written digit forms a secondary point source
under coherent illumination, whose responses at the image
plane are integrated to form the speckle patterns shown in
the bottom row of Figure 2. Those speckle patterns are in-
tensity distributions that can be captured by traditional im-
age sensors. After training with tens of thousands of speck-
les from different hand-written digits, the deep network is
able to ﬁnd meaningful invariant features among speckles
generated from the same digit with various hand-written
styles, and infer the properties of these objects that have
interacted with the light during its propagation.
In other
words, with well-trained deep networks, one can retrieve
the information from speckle patterns to identify the object.

3.2. Simulation and Experiment Methods

We supported the above theory by performing a set of
experiments and simulations. To recognize objects without
line-of-sight, the simplest situation is shown in Figure 3.
The direct line-of-sight between the object and the cam-
era is blocked by a wall; therefore, direct images cannot

11739

be formed through traditional imaging systems. However,
in many situations, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd another surface
(usually a diffusive surface) that can reﬂect part of the light
from the object to the camera. A typical example is another
wall, which is located at a convenient place, as depicted in
Figure 3. Under coherent illumination, the light scattered
off the object forms speckle patterns on the “relay” wall,
which is captured by the camera and understood by the deep
network. The coherent illumination covers the object to be
detected.

to completely block the direct line-of-sight between them.
The distances between the object, camera and the wall are
approximately 20 cm.

Figure 4. Experimental setup for object recognition with one wall.

Figure 3. Schematic of object recognition with one wall as the
scattering surface. The wall on the left side blocks the direct line-
of-sight between the object and the camera.

Both the simulation and the experiment were performed
under this scheme. In the simulation, the objects were mod-
eled as opaque boards with the transparent features of the
digits allowing light to pass. Coherent illumination was
modeled as a simple plane wave. The Fourier optics method
was used to simulate the light propagation process. The
wall was modeled as a scattering object with pixelated ran-
dom phase modulation. The lens was modeled as a phase
modulation element with perfect image forming ability.

In the experiment, as shown in Figure 4, the object was a
reﬂective LCD screen (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) displaying the im-
ages of hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. The
camera was an off-the-shelf camera (Thorlabs CS2100M
CMOS) with a lens (Thorlabs MVL35M23) focused on the
wall, which is an aluminum board (30.5 cm × 30.5 cm)
painted with white egg-shell wall paint to emulate a real in-
door diffusive wall surface. A HeNe laser (632.8 nm, Thor-
labs HNL150R) was used to provide coherent illumination
to the object, which covered the whole LCD screen. An-
other wall was installed between the camera and the LCD

Figure 5. Schematic of object recognition with the coherent light
source on the same side as the camera.

In real application, however, it is often impossible to di-
rectly access the occluded object to provide coherent illu-
mination. One alternative way is to use the “relay” wall to
reﬂect the coherent light into the “object” space, as shown
in Figure 5. This scheme allows for much wider application
of this technology. To verify its feasibility, we performed
the simulation as follows. The light source was modeled
as a point source that propagates to the wall; the light is
scattered, and then it propagates to the object. The subse-
quent steps are similar to the simulation process described

11740

above. In practice, the patch of wall surface that the cam-
era is pointed at should be away from the laser spot on the
wall to avoid potential saturation of the sensor from the high
intensity laser beam.

Theoretically, the speckle pattern on the wall is deter-
mined to the ﬁrst order by the object scattering the light, and
it should stay relatively invariant within a range of varying
wall surface conditions. The surface condition might mod-
ulate the speckle patterns and appear as increased noise. To
verify the feasibility, we designed an experiment in which
the wall is rotating, as shown in Figure 6. In the experiment,
the wall was a round plastic plate painted with white egg-
shell wall paint. The camera lens was focused on the outer
rim of the plastic plate. We rotated the wall by a random de-
gree after every capture so that each instance of the object
was effectively reﬂected by a different random patch of the
wall. This experiment tested the robustness of this scheme.

Figure 6. Schematic of object recognition with a rotating wall.

We further extended the capability of this scheme to situ-
ations with two diffusive walls, as shown in Figure 7. In the
simulation, the second wall was added after the ﬁrst wall,
and the camera lens focused on the second wall that was di-
rectly visible to the camera. This opened up the possibility
to use this technology in much more complex environments
in which the light from the object undergoes multiple reﬂec-
tions before reaching the camera.

3.3. Data Preprocessing

Data (speckle patterns) from both the simulation and the
experiment need to be preprocessed before training with the
deep network.
(1) Due to computational limitations, we
only cropped a small part of the output speckle images.
This process reduces both the number of network param-
eters and the required data size for training without overﬁt-

ting [22]. Because each part of the output speckle image
contains information of the whole object, even a small part
of the speckle image can be used for object recognition. In
other words, image cropping does not affect the ﬁnal recog-
nition results.
(2) In a real environment for recognition,
there could be various disturbances arising from tempera-
ture variation, vibration, drifting, etc. Therefore, adding
simulated random noises to the speckle patterns could in-
crease the recognition accuracy.
(3) The speckle images
were normalized between 0 and 1. Typically, two datasets
were used in this study: MNIST dataset of hand-written dig-
its and human body posture dataset.

In the experiment, because the LCD screen had only the
on and off states, the images of the hand-written digits from
the MNIST dataset were binarized for display on the LCD
screen. The ﬁrst 10,000 hand-written digits in the MNIST
were used in both the experiments and the simulations.

The posture dataset was preprocessed before the simu-
lation by using DeepLab-v3 [6, 7] as a human detector to
remove the background. It was also converted to the gray
scale.

3.4. Deep Networks for Speckle Pattern Recognition

We used deep networks to dig the semantic information
in the speckle pattern images to relate them to the original
objects, though the images were not recognizable by hu-
mans. In our experiments and simulations, the object recog-
nition problems were typical image classiﬁcation problems.
Thus, we could follow the common practices in computer
vision to train and test the classiﬁcation networks. We ap-
plied two networks, a simple network (termed SimpleNet)
and ResNet-18 [5, 8, 12].

SimpleNet contains 4 convolutional layers with ReLu ac-
tivation. The ﬁrst two convolutional layers have 16 3×3 ﬁl-
ters (with 2×2 max pooling), and the third and fourth con-
volutional layers have 32 3×3 ﬁlters (with 2×2 max pool-
ing). A fully connected layer with 1024 neurons is used
right before the output layer of 10 neurons for 10 digits.
SimpleNet has high training and testing speed and it was
used in our MNIST experiments. The speckle patterns were
cropped to 200×200 and fed into SimpleNet. Among the
10,000 samples, a randomly chosen subset of 95% of the
samples were used for training and the remaining 5% were
used for testing.

ResNet is widely applied in understanding visual im-
ages. Due to its unique residual connection design shown
in Figure 8, it is easy to train very deep residual networks.
We use the ImageNet pretrained ResNet models which are
publicly available in PyTorch [9]. The last full connection
layer was replaced with 10 neurons for 10 class human body
posture classiﬁcations. An input speckle pattern image was
ﬁrst resized to 256×256; then randomly cropped 224×224
patches from it were used in training. For testing, a speckle
pattern image was directly resized to 224×224 and then fed
into ResNet. We chose ResNet-18 for its high-speed, high-
performance and good generalization ability.

4. Experiments

4.1. Experimental Results for MNIST

We ﬁrst used the MNIST dataset to demonstrate its fea-
sibility with the simplest situation where the light scattered

off an object reﬂects only once before reaching the camera,
as shown in Figure 3. Both an experiment and a simula-
tion were performed. Examples of speckle images on the
wall from the experiment are shown in Figure 9. All images
are full of speckles, indicating strong scattering and inter-
ference effects. The deep network used in the experiment
is SimpleNet deﬁned in Section 3.4. Despite the lack of a
direct line-of-sight, the recognition accuracy in the experi-
ment and the simulation are 95% and 97% respectively. As
expected, the experiment has slightly lower accuracy, likely
due to noise, of which there were multiple sources, includ-
ing image sensor noise, ambient light, temperature ﬂuctua-
tion, vibration, and movement of each element used in the
experiment which could cause speckle pattern drifting.

Figure 9. Speckle patterns of different hand-written digits captured
on the CMOS image sensor in the experiment.

To demonstrate the feasibility of having a laser and a
camera on the same side of the blocking wall, as shown
in Figure 5, we performed a simulation using the MNIST
data.
In this case neither the light source nor the detec-
tor had a direct line-of-sight of the object. This arrange-
ment is much more widely applicable than the previous sit-

plex objects with more detailed features and greater varia-
tions in the shape could result in more challenges to the
recognition task. Here, we used human body posture as an
example to demonstrate the recognition of complex objects.
We performed a simulation following the scheme shown in
Figure 3 with one still wall and using the human body pos-
ture dataset. The dataset contains 10 posture categories, and
the image data is collected from 12 human subjects [14].
Images in this dataset contain much more complex features
of the human body than the hand-written digits, and the
same body posture shows appreciable variations among dif-
ferent human subjects, as shown in Figure 10. The recog-
nition task was therefore much harder compared to the sit-
uation using the MNIST dataset. We extracted the human
body posture data using a DeepLab-v3 person segmenta-
tion model [6, 7] to remove the background, based on the
assumption that in real applications the background is of-
ten at a distance from the object to be recognized and there-
fore, light scattered from the object will have a larger impact
on the speckle pattern on the wall. We also converted the
color images to the gray scale because the coherent source
is monochromatic.

uation. Simulation shows that the recognition accuracy is
97%, which is not very different from that in the previous
case. In the experimental demonstration, the light intensity
of the laser will be greatly reduced after it diffusively re-
ﬂects from the wall. Further, the signal-to-noise ratio could
be much smaller and we expect the recognition accuracy to
decrease. It would, however, require additional engineering
effort to achieve satisfying performance. Nonetheless, this
simulation results demonstrate the possibility of having the
laser and detector on the same side, which opens up oppor-
tunities for a wide range of applications.

To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we per-
formed an experiment where the wall is rotated by a random
degree after each measurement and every example of the
object is effectively reﬂected from a different patch on the
wall, as shown in Figure 6. Recognition accuracy is 91%,
slightly lower than that for a still wall, but still signiﬁcantly
high. It shows that this conﬁguration of NLOS recognition
is independent of the speciﬁc textures of the wall.

Furthermore, we extended the simulation to add another
diffusive wall to the setup, as shown in Figure 7. This in-
creases the complexity of the scene. The recognition ac-
curacy is 97%, similar to the situation of having only one
wall. The simulation results demonstrate the power of this
scheme, which potentially allows object recognition after
multiple reﬂections in a complex scene.

A summary of the recognition results of the experiments
and the simulations using the MNIST dataset is shown in
Table 1.

images were trained and tested using the ResNet-18 net-

work. The training was performed on 11 out of 12 human
subjects and tested on the remaining one human subject.
This was repeated 12 times and the recognition rate was
taken as the average of these 12 experiments. We achieved
an average recognition accuracy of 78.18%, which is higher
than the three-way human body posture classiﬁcation result
reported in [30]. The recognition rate could be further im-
proved by increasing the number and diversity of human
subjects. The confusion matrix of the 10 different postures
(labels 0-9) is shown in Figure 12. These results demon-
strate the potential of our approach to recognize complex
objects.

trix for the 10 body postures.

5. Conclusions

We demonstrated direct object recognition without line-
of-sight. Direct object recognition does not require forming
a clear image, thereby greatly reduces the complexity of the
system hardware. Such recognition is enabled by optical co-
herence, which is provided by illuminating an object with a
laser. The resulting speckle pattern from the scattered light

is analyzed using a deep-learning algorithm.

To verify the feasibility and performance of this new
approach, we quantitatively evaluated NLOS recognition
based on simulations and experiments with MNIST hand-
written digits and human body postures. The results show
that the recognition accuracy can be well above 90% for
the MNIST data in various scenarios, and 78.18% for the
human body posture data. That the ﬁnal recognition result
was highly dependent on the deep-learning algorithm indi-
cates that there are many opportunities to further improve
the recognition accuracy with additional optimization of the
deep network model, especially for objects with complex
features.

In addition to the advantages of this new approach, there
are limitations which afford opportunities for future work.
For example, noises (e.g. vibration) in the experiment could
cause drifting of the speckle patterns, which would re-
duce the recognition accuracy. Moreover, the light intensity
could be greatly reduced after it diffusively reﬂects from the
wall, resulting in a much lower signal-to-noise ratio and po-
tentially lower recognition accuracy. A ﬁlter could be used
to reject ambient light. To increase working distance and
area, a laser with a diverging beam could be used, such as
edge-emitting diode laser. More robust hardware and deep-
learning algorithm will be needed to further improve the
performance.

In brief, this NLOS object recognition using coherent il-
lumination opens a new gate to situations where direct line-
of-sight is blocked, and provides plenty of opportunities for
research and application.
