Abstract

Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely ex-
plored, but achieving realistic, human-like performance is
still unsolved. This is due to the lack of available 3D
datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To ad-
dress this, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about
29 minutes of 4D scans captured at 60 fps and synchro-
nized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a neural net-
work on our dataset that factors identity from facial mo-
tion. The learned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Char-
acter Animation) takes any speech signal as input—even
speech in languages other than English—and realistically
animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on sub-
ject labels during training allows the model to learn a va-
riety of realistic speaking styles. VOCA also provides an-
imator controls to alter speaking style, identity-dependent
facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball ro-
tations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is
the only realistic 3D facial animation model that is read-

ily applicable to unseen subjects without retargeting. This
makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, vir-
tual reality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker,
speech, or language is not known in advance. We make
the dataset and model available for research purposes at

1. Introduction

Teaching computers to see and understand faces is crit-
ical for them to understand human behavior. There is an
extensive literature on estimating 3D face shape, facial ex-
pressions, and facial motion from images and videos. Less
attention has been paid to estimating 3D properties of faces
from sound; however, many facial motions are caused di-
rectly by the production of speech. Understanding the cor-
relation between speech and facial motion thus provides ad-

ditional valuable information for analyzing humans, par-
ticularly if visual data are noisy, missing, or ambiguous.
The relation between speech and facial motion has previ-
ously been used to separate audio-visual speech [22] and
for audio-video driven facial animation [38]. Missing to
date is a general and robust method that relates the speech
of any person in any language to the 3D facial motion of
any face shape. Here we present VOCA (Voice Operated
Character Animation), that takes a step towards this goal.

While speech-driven 3D facial animation has been
widely studied, speaker-independent modeling remains a
challenging, unsolved task for several reasons. First, speech
signals and facial motion are strongly correlated but lie
in two very different spaces; thus, non-linear regression
functions are needed to relate the two. One can exploit
deep neural networks to address this problem. However,
this means that signiﬁcant amounts of training data are
needed. Second, there exists a many-to-many mapping be-
tween phonemes and facial motion. This poses an even
greater challenge when training across people and styles.
Third, because we are especially sensitive to faces, particu-
larly realistic faces, the animation must be realistic to avoid
falling into the Uncanny Valley [39]. Fourth, there is very
limited training data relating speech to the 3D face shape of
multiple speakers. Finally, while previous work has shown
that models can be trained to create speaker-speciﬁc anima-
tions [14, 33], there are no generic methods that are speaker
independent and that capture a variety of speaking styles.

VOCASET: To address this, we collected a new dataset
of 4D face scans together with speech. The dataset has 12
subjects and 480 sequences of about 3-4 seconds each with
sentences chosen from an array of standard protocols that
maximize phonetic diversity. The 4D scans are captured
at 60fps and we align a common face template mesh to all
the scans, bringing them into correspondence. This dataset,
called VOCASET, is unlike any existing public datasets. It
allows training and testing of speech-to-animation models
that can generalize to new data.

VOCA: Given such data, we train a deep neural net-
work model, called VOCA (Figure 2), that generalizes to
new speakers (see Figure 1). Recent work using deep net-
works has shown impressive results for the problem of re-
gressing speaker-dependent facial animation from speech
[33]. Their work, however, captures the idiosyncrasies of
an individual, making it inappropriate for generalization
across characters. While deep learning is advancing the
ﬁeld quickly, even the best recent methods rely on some
manual processes or focus only on the mouth [53], making
them inappropriate for truly automatic full facial animation.

The key problem with prior work is that facial motion
and facial identity are confounded. Our key insight is to fac-
tor identity from facial motions and then learn a model re-
lating speech to only the motions. Conditioning on subject

labels during training allows us to combine data from many
subjects in the training process, which enables the model
both to generalize to new subjects not seen during train-
ing and to synthesize different speaker styles. Integrating
DeepSpeech [29] for audio feature extraction makes VOCA
robust w.r.t. different audio sources and noise. Building
on top of the expressive FLAME head model [37] allows
us i) to model motions of the full face (i.e.
including the
neck), ii) to animate a wide range of adult faces, as FLAME
can be used to reconstruct subject-speciﬁc templates from
a scan or image, and iii) to edit identity-dependent shape
and head pose during animation. VOCA and VOCASET
are available for research purposes [58].

2. Related work

Facial animation has received signiﬁcant attention in the
literature. Related work in this area can be grouped into
three categories: speech-based, text-based, and video- or
performance-based.

Speech-driven facial animation: Due to the abundance
of images and videos, many methods that attempt to real-
istically animate faces use monocular video [7, 8, 16, 23,
51, 59, 62]. Bregler et al. [8] transcribe speech with a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) into phonetic labels and an-
imate the mouth region in videos with an exemplar-based
video warping. Brand [7] uses a mix of Linear Predictive
Coding (LPC) and RASTA-PLP [30] audio features and an
HMM to output a sequence of facial motion vectors. Ezzat
et al. [23] perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
on all images and use an example-based mapping between
phonemes and trajectories of mouth shape and mouth tex-
ture parameters in the PCA space. Xie and Liu [62] model
facial animation with a dynamic Bayesian network-based
model. Wang et al. [59] use an HMM to learn a map-
ping between Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefﬁcients (MFCC)
and PCA model parameters. Zhang et al. [67] combine
the HMM-based method of [59] trained on audio and vi-
sual data of one actor with a deep neural network based en-
coder trained from hundreds of hours of speaker indepen-
dent speech data to compute an embedding of the MFCC
audio features. Shimba et al. [48] use a deep Long Short-
term Memory (LSTM) network to regress active appearance
model (AAM) parameters from MFCC features. Chen et
al. [16] correlate audio and image motion to synthesize lip
motion of arbitrary identities.

Suwajanakorn et al. [51] use an Recurrent Neural Net-
work (RNN) for synthesizing photorealistic mouth tex-
ture animations using audio from 1.9 million frames from
Obama’s weekly addresses. However, their method does
not generalize to unseen faces or viewpoints.
In contrast
to this, VOCA is trained across subjects sharing a com-
mon topology, which makes it possible to animate new faces
from previously unseen viewpoints. Pham et al. [42] regress

10102

global transformation and blendshape coefﬁcients [13] from
MFCC audio features using an LSTM network. While their
model is trained across subjects—similar to VOCA—they
rely on model parameters regressed from 2D videos rather
than using 3D scans, which limits their quality.

A few methods use multi-view motion capture data [10,
14] or high-resolution 3D scans [33]. Busso et al. [10] syn-
thesize rigid head motion in expressive speech sequences.
Cao et al. [14] segment the audio into phonemes and use an
example-based graph method to select a matching mouth
animation. Karras et al. [33] propose a convolutional model
for mapping LPC audio features to 3D vertex displace-
ments. However, their model is subject speciﬁc, and ani-
mating a new face would require 3D capture and processing
of thousands of frames of subject data. Our model, VOCA
factors identity from facial motion and is trained across sub-
jects, which allows animation of a wide range of adult faces.
Several works also aim at animating artist designed char-
acter rigs [20, 21, 31, 32, 46, 52, 53, 54, 70]. Taylor et
al. [53] propose a deep-learning based speech-driven fa-
cial animation model using a sliding window approach on
transcribed phoneme sequences that outperforms previous
LSTM based methods [24, 25]. While these models are sim-
ilar to VOCA in that they animate a generic face from audio,
our focus is animating a realistic face mesh, for which we
train our model on high-resolution face-scans.

Text-driven facial animation: Some methods aim to
animate faces directly from text. Sako et al. [45] use a
hidden Markov model to animate lips in images from text.
Anderson et al. [4] use an extended hidden Markov text-to-
speech model to drive a subject-speciﬁc active appearance
model (AAM). In a follow-up, they extend this approach
to animate the face of an actress in 3D. While our focus is
not to animate faces from text, this is possible by animating
our model with the output of a text-to-speech (TTS) system
(e.g. [56]), similar to Karras et al. [33].

Performance-based facial animation: Most methods
to animate digital avatars are based on visual data. Alexan-
der et al. [3], Wu et al. [61], and Laine et al. [35] build
subject-speciﬁc face-rigs from high-resolution face scans
and animate these rigs with video-based animation systems.
Several methods build personalized face-rigs using
generic face models from monocular videos to transfer and
reenact facial performance between videos. Tensor-based
multilinear face models [5, 11, 12, 19, 57, 63] and linear
models [55] are widely used to build personalized face-rigs.
Cao et al. [11, 12] use a regression-based face tracker to an-
imate the face-rig and digital avatars, while Thies et al. [55]
use a landmark-based face tracker and deformation trans-
fer [50] to reenact monocular videos.

Other methods that animate virtual avatars rely on RGB-
D videos or 4D sequences to track and retarget facial perfor-
mance. Li et al. [36] and Weise et al. [60] capture example-

based rigs in an ofﬂine calibration procedure to build per-
sonalized face-rigs, Bouaziz et al. [6] use a generic identity
model. Liu et al. [38] combine audio and video to robustly
animate a generic face model from RGB-D video. Li et
al. [37] capture facial performance with a high-resolution
scanner and animate static face meshes using an articulated
generic head model. In contrast to these methods, our ap-
proach solely relies on audio to animate digital avatars.

3D face datasets: Several 3D face datasets have been
released that focus on the analysis of static 3D facial shape
and expression (e.g. [13, 47, 65]) or dynamic facial expres-
sions (e.g. [68, 2, 15, 18, 44, 64, 69]). Most of these datasets
focus on emotional expressions and only a few datasets cap-
ture facial dynamics caused by speech. The recently pub-
lished 4DFAB dataset [17] contains 4D captures of 180 sub-
jects, but with only nine word utterances per subject and
lower mesh quality than VOCASET.

The B3D(AC)ˆ2 dataset [26] contains a large set of
audio-4D scan pairs of 40 spoken English sentences.
In
contrast, VOCASET contains 255 unique sentences in to-
tal. To enable training on both a large number of sentences
and subjects, some sentences are shared across subjects and
some sentences are spoken by only one subject. The visible
artifacts present in the raw B3D(AC)ˆ2 scans (i.e. holes and
capture noise) mean that subtle facial motions may be lost;
also, the registered template only covers the face, ignoring
speech-related motions in the neck region. VOCASET, in
comparison, provides higher-quality 3D scans as well as
alignments of the entire head, including the neck.

3. Preliminaries

Our goal for VOCA is to generalize well to arbitrary sub-
jects not seen during training. Generalization across sub-
jects involves both (i) generalization across different speak-
ers in terms of the audio (variations in accent, speed, au-
dio source, noise, environment, etc.) and (ii) generalization
across different facial shapes and motion.

DeepSpeech: To gain robustness to different audio
sources, regardless of noise, recording artifacts, or lan-
guage, we integrate DeepSpeech [29] into our model. Deep-
Speech [29] is an end-to-end deep learning model for
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). DeepSpeech uses a
simple architecture consisting of ﬁve layers of hidden units,
of which the ﬁrst three layers are non-recurrent fully con-
nected layers with ReLU activations. The fourth layer is a
bi-directional RNN, and the ﬁnal layer is a fully connected
layer with ReLU activation. The ﬁnal layer of the network
is fed to a softmax function whose output is a probability
distribution over characters. The TensorFlow implementa-
tion provided by Mozilla [40] slightly differs from the orig-
inal paper in two ways: (i) the RNN units are replaced by
LSTM cells and (ii) 26 MFCC audio features are used in-
stead of directly performing inference on the spectrogram.

Please see [40] for more details.

FLAME: Facial shape and head motion vary greatly
across subjects. Furthermore, different people have differ-
ent speaking styles. The large variability in facial shape,
motion, and speaking style motivates using a common
learning space. We address this problem by incorporat-
ing FLAME, a publicly available statistical head model, as
part of our animation pipeline. FLAME uses linear trans-
formations to describe identity and expression dependent
shape variations, and standard linear blend skinning (LBS)
to model neck, jaw, and eyeball rotations. Given a template
T ∈ R3N in the “zero pose”, identity, pose, and expression
blendshapes are modeled as vertex offsets from T. For more
details we refer the reader to [37].

4. VOCA

This section describes the model architecture and pro-

vides details on how the input audio is processed.

Overview: VOCA receives as input a subject-speciﬁc
template T and the raw audio signal, from which we extract
features using DeepSpeech [29]. The desired output is the
target 3D mesh. VOCA acts as an encoder-decoder network
(see Figure 2 and Table 1) where the encoder learns to trans-
form audio features to a low-dimensional embedding and
the decoder maps this embedding into a high-dimensional
space of 3D vertex displacements

Speech feature extraction: Given an input audio clip
of length T seconds, we use DeepSpeech to extract speech
features. The outputs are unnormalized log probabilities of
characters for frames of length 0.02 s (50 frames per sec-
ond); thus, it is an array of size 50T × D, where D is the
number of characters in the alphabet plus one for a blank
label. We resample the output to 60 fps using linear inter-
polation. In order to incorporate temporal information, we
convert the audio frames to overlapping windows of size
W × D, where W is the window size. The output is a three-
dimensional array of dimensions 60T × W × D.

Encoder: The encoder is composed of four convolu-
tional layers and two fully connected layers. The speech
features and the ﬁnal convolutional layer are conditioned

on the subject labels to learn subject-speciﬁc styles when
trained across multiple subjects. For eight training sub-
jects, each subject j is encoded as an one-hot-vector
Ij = (δij)1≤i≤8. This vector is concatenated to each D-
dimensional speech feature vector (i.e.
resulting in win-
dows of dimension W × (D + 8)), and concatenated to the
output of the ﬁnal convolution layer.

To learn temporal features and reduce the dimensional-
ity of the input, each convolutional layer uses a kernel of
dimension 3 × 1 and stride 2 × 1. As the features ex-
tracted using DeepSpeech do not have any spatial corre-
lation, we reshape the input window to have dimensions
W × 1 × (D + 8) and perform 1D convolutions over the
temporal dimension. To avoid overﬁtting, we keep the num-
ber of parameters small and only learn 32 ﬁlters for the ﬁrst
two, and 64 ﬁlters for the last two convolutional layers.

The concatenation of the ﬁnal convolutional layer with
the subject encoding is followed by two fully connected lay-
ers. The ﬁrst has 128 units and a hyperbolic tangent activa-
tion function; the second is a linear layer with 50 units.

Decoder: The decoder of VOCA is a fully connected
layer with linear activation function, outputting the 5023 ×
3 dimensional array of vertex displacements from T. The
weights of the layer are initialized by 50 PCA components
computed over the vertex displacements of the training data;
the bias is initialized with zeros.

Animation control: During inference, changing the
eight-dimensional one-hot-vector alters the output speaking
style. The output of VOCA is an expressed 3D face in “zero
pose” with the same mesh topology as the FLAME face
model [37]. VOCA’s compatibility with FLAME allows
alteration of the identity-dependent facial shape by adding
weighted shape blendshapes from FLAME. The face ex-
pression and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball rotations) can
also be changed using the blendweights, joints, and pose
blendshapes provided by FLAME.

5. Model training

In this section we describe training relevant details.
Training set-up: We start from a large dataset of audio-
i=1. Here xi ∈ RW ×D
4D scan pairs, denoted as {(xi, yi)}F
is the input audio window centered at the ith video frame,
yi ∈ RN ×3. Further, let fi ∈ RN ×3 denote the output of
VOCA for xi.

For training, we split the captured data into a training
set (eight subjects), a validation set (two subjects), and a
test set (two subjects). The training set consists of all 40
sentences of the eight subjects, i.e. in total 320 sentences.
For validation and test data, we only select the 20 unique
sentences that are not shared with any other subject, i.e. 40
sentences for validation and testing, respectively. Note that
our training, validation, and test sets for all experiments are
fully disjoint, i.e. no overlap of subjects or sentences exists.

Figure 2: VOCA network architecture.

Loss function: Our training loss function consists of
two terms, a position term and a velocity term. The posi-
tion term Ep = kyi − fik2
F computes the distance between
the predicted outputs and the training vertices. This position
term encourages the model to match the ground truth perfor-
mance. The velocity term Ev = k(yi−yi−1)−(fi−fi−1)k2
F
uses backward ﬁnite differences. It computes the distance
between the differences of consecutive frames between pre-
dicted outputs and training vertices. This velocity term in-
duces temporal stability.

Training parameters: We perform hyperparameter tun-
ing on the held-out validation set. We train VOCA for 50
epochs with a constant learning rate of 1e − 4. The weights
for the position and velocity terms are 1.0 and 10.0, respec-
tively. During training, we use batch normalization with a
batch size of 64. We use a window size of W = 16 with
D = 29 speech features.

Implementation details: VOCA is implemented in
Python using TensorFlow [1], and trained using Adam [34].
Training one epoch takes about ten minutes on a single
NVIDIA Tesla K20. We use a pre-trained DeepSpeech
model [40] which is kept ﬁxed during training.

6. VOCASET

This section introduces VOCASET and describes the

capture setup and data processing.

VOCASET: Our dataset contains a collection of audio-
4D scan pairs captured from 6 female and 6 male subjects.
For each subject, we collect 40 sequences of a sentence spo-
ken in English, each of length three to ﬁve seconds. The
sentences were taken from an array of standard protocols
and were selected to maximize phonetic diversity using the
method described in [27]. In particular, each subject spoke
27 sentences from the TIMIT corpus [28], three pangrams
used by [33], and 10 questions from the Stanford Question

Figure 3: Sample meshes of two VOCASET subjects.

Answering Dataset (SQuAD) [43]. The recorded sequences
are distributed such that ﬁve sentences are shared across all
subjects, 15 sentences are spoken by three to ﬁve subjects
(50 unique sentences), and 20 sentences are spoken only by
one or two subjects (200 unique sentences). We make VO-
CASET available to the research community.

Capture setup: We use a multi-camera active stereo
system (3dMD LLC, Atlanta) to capture high-quality 3D
head scans and audio. The capture system consists of six
pairs of gray-scale stereo cameras, six color cameras, ﬁve
speckle pattern projectors, and six white light LED panels.
The system captures 3D meshes at 60fps, each with about
120K vertices. The color images are used to generate UV
texture maps for each scan. The audio, synchronized with
the scanner, is captured with a sample rate of 22 kHz.

Data processing: The raw 3D head scans are registered
with a sequential alignment method as described in [37]
using the publicly available generic FLAME model. The

10105

DeepSpeech windowsTime convolutionsDecoder networkInputOne-hot subject encodingTemplateTemplateSpeech signalAddDecoder networkOutputimage-based landmark prediction method of [9] is used dur-
ing alignment to add robustness while tracking fast facial
motions. After alignment, each mesh consists of 5023 3D
vertices. For all scans, we measure the absolute distance be-
tween each scan vertex and the closest point in the FLAME
alignment surface: median (0.09mm), mean (0.13mm), and
standard deviation (0.14mm). Thus, the alignments faith-
fully represent the raw data.

All meshes are then unposed; i.e. effects of global rota-
tion, translation, and head rotation around the neck are re-
moved. After unposing, all meshes are in “zero pose”. For
each sequence, the neck boundary and the ears are auto-
matically ﬁxed, and the region around the eyes is smoothed
using Gaussian ﬁltering to remove capture noise. Note that
no smoothing is applied to the mouth region so as to pre-
serve subtle motions. Figure 3 shows sample alignments of
two VOCASET subjects. The supplementary video shows
sequences of all subjects.

7. Experiments

Quantitative metrics, such as the norm on the predic-
tion error, are not suitable for evaluating animation quality.
This is because facial visemes form many-to-many map-
pings with speech utterances. A wide range of plausible
facial motions exists for the same speech sequence, which
makes quantitative evaluation intractable. Instead, we per-
form perceptual and qualitative evaluations. Further, our
trained model is available for research purposes for direct
comparisons [58].

7.1. Perceptual evaluation

User study: We conduct three Amazon Mechanical Turk
(AMT) blind user studies: i) a binary comparison between
held-out test sequences and our model conditioned on all
training subjects, ii) an ablation study to assess the effec-
tiveness of the DeepSpeech features, and iii) a study to in-
vestigate the correlation between style, content, and iden-
tity. All experiments are performed on sequences and sub-
jects fully disjoint from our training and validation set.

For binary comparisons, two videos with the same ani-
mated subject and audio clip are shown side by side. For
each video pair, the participant is asked to choose the talk-
ing head that moves more naturally and in accordance with
the audio. To avoid any selection bias, the order (left/right)
of all methods for comparison is random for each pair.

Style comparisons are used to evaluate the learned
speaking styles. Here, Turkers see three videos: one ref-
erence and two predictions. The task is to determine which
of the two predictions is more similar to the reference video.
To ensure the quality of the study and remove potential
outliers, we require Turkers to pass a simple qualiﬁcation
test before they are allowed to submit HITs. The qualiﬁca-
tion task is a simpliﬁed version of the following user study,

where we show three comparisons with an obvious answer,
i.e. one ground-truth sequence and one sequence with com-
pletely mismatched video and audio.

Comparison to recorded performance: We compare
captured and processed test sequences with VOCA predic-
tions conditioned on all eight speaker styles. In total, Turk-
ers (400 HITs) perceived the recorded performance more
natural (83 ± 9%) than the predictions (17 ± 9%), across
all conditions. While VOCA results in realistic facial mo-
tion for the unseen subjects, it is unable to synthesize the id-
iosyncrasies of these subjects. As such, these subtle subject-
speciﬁc details make the recorded sequences look more nat-
ural than the predictions.

Speech feature ablation: We replace the DeepSpeech
features by Mel-ﬁlterbank energy features (fbank) and train
a model for 50 epochs (the same as for VOCA). Turkers
(400 HITs) perceived the performance of VOCA with Deep-
Speech more natural (78 ± 16%) than with fbank features
(22 ± 16%) across all conditions. That indicates that VOCA
with DeepSpeech features generalizes better to unseen au-
dio sequences than with fbank features.

Style comparisons: Speech-driven facial performance
varies greatly across subjects. However, it is difﬁcult to
separate between style (facial motion of a subject), iden-
tity (facial shape of a subject), and content (the words being
said), and how these different factors inﬂuence perception.
The goal of this user study is to evaluate the speech-driven
facial motion independently from identity-dependent face
shape in order to understand if people can recognize the
styles learned by our model.

To accomplish this, we subtract the personalized tem-
plate (neutral face) from all sequences to obtain “displace-
ments”,
then add these displacements to a single com-
mon template (randomly sampled from the FLAME shape
space). Then, for several reference sequences from the
training data, we compare two VOCA predictions (on audio
from the test set): one conditioned on the reference subject
and one conditioned on another randomly selected subject.
We ask Turkers to select which predicted sequence is more
similar in speaking style to the reference.

To explore the inﬂuence of content, we perform the ex-
periment twice, once where the reference video and the pre-
dictions share the same sentence (spoken by different sub-
jects) and once with different sentences. Figure 4 shows
the results for this experiment. Results varied greatly across
conditions. For some conditions, Turkers could consistently
pick the sequence with the matching style (e.g. conditions
3, 4, and 5); for others, their choices were no better or worse
than chance. The impact of the content was not signiﬁcant
for most conditions. More research is needed to understand
which factors are important for people to recognize differ-
ent speaking styles, and to develop new models that more
efﬁciently disentangle facial shape and motion.

7.2. Qualitative evaluation

Generalization across subjects: Factoring identity
from facial motion allows us to animate a wide range of
adult faces. To show the generalization capabilities of
VOCA, we select, align and pose-normalize multiple neu-
tral scans from the BU-3DFE database [66], with large
shape variations. Figure 5 shows the static template (left)
and some VOCA animation frames, driven by the same au-
dio sequence.

Generalization across languages: The video shows the
VOCA output for different languages. This indicates that
VOCA can generalize to non-English sentences.

Speaker styles: Conditioning on different subjects dur-
ing inference results in different speaking styles. Stylistic
differences include variation in lip articulation. Figure 6
shows the distance between lower and upper lip as a func-
tion of time for VOCA predictions for a random audio se-
quence and different conditions. This indicates that the con-
vex combination of styles provides a wide range of different
mouth amplitudes.

We generate new intermediate speaking styles by convex
combinations of conditions. Due to the linearity of the de-
coder, performing this convex combination in the 3D vertex
space or in the 50-dimensional encoding space is equiva-
lent. The supplementary video shows that combining styles
offers animation control to synthesize a range of varying
speaking styles. This is potentially useful for matching the
speaking performance of a subject not seen during training.

shows the template of a subject selected from the static BU-
3DFE face database [66] (left), and three randomly selected
animation frames, driven by the same audio input (right).

predictions conditioned on different subjects. The shaded
region represents the space of convex combinations of the
different conditions.

In the future, this could be estimated from video.

Robustness to noise: To demonstrate robustness to
noise, we combine a speech signal with different levels of
noise and use the noisy signal as VOCA input. As a noise
source, we use a realistic street noise sequence [49] added
with negative gain of 36dB (low), 24dB (medium), 18dB
(slightly high), and 12dB (high). Only the high noise level
leads to a damped facial motion, but despite the noise, the
facial animations remain plausible.

Comparison to Karras et al. [33]: We compare VOCA
to Karras et al. [33], the state-of-the-art in realistic subject-
speciﬁc audio-driven facial animation. The results are

are weakly correlated with the audio signal and hence are
not modeled well by audio-driven techniques. VOCA of-
fers animators and developers the possibility to include head
motion, but does not infer it from data. A speech indepen-
dent model for head motion could be used to simulate real-
istic results. Application speciﬁc techniques, such as dyadic
interactions between animated assistants and humans re-
quire attention mechanisms that consider spatial features,
such as eye tracking. Learning richer conversation models
with expressive bodies [41] is future research.

Conditioning on subject labels is one of the key aspects
of VOCA that allows training across subjects. This allows
a user to alter the speaking style during inference. Using
data from more subjects to increase the number of differ-
ent speaking styles remains a task for future work. Further
experiments on mitigating or amplifying different speak-
ing styles, or combining characteristics of different subjects
also remain for future work.

9. Conclusion

We have presented VOCA, a simple and generic speech-
driven facial animation framework that works across a range
of identities. Given an arbitrary speech signal and a static
character mesh, VOCA fully automatically outputs a realis-
tic character animation. VOCA leverages recent advances
in speech processing and 3D face modeling in order to be
subject independent. We train our model on a self-captured
multi-subject 4D face dataset (VOCASET). The key in-
sights of VOCA are to factor identity from facial motion,
which allows us to animate a wide range of adult faces,
and to condition on subject labels, which enables us to train
VOCA across multiple subjects, and to synthesize differ-
ent speaker styles during test time. VOCA generalizes well
across various speech sources, languages, and 3D face tem-
plates. We provide optional animation control parameters to
vary the speaking style and to alter the identity dependent
shape and head pose during animation. The dataset, trained
model, and code are available for research purposes [58].

shown in the supplementary video. For comparison, the au-
thors provided us with a static mesh, to which we aligned
the FLAME topology. We then use eight audio sequences
from their supplementary video (including singing, spoken
Chinese, an excerpt of a Barack Obama speech, and dif-
ferent sequences of the actor), to animate their static mesh.
The supplementary video shows that, while their model pro-
duces more natural and detailed results, we can still repro-
duce similar facial animation without using any of their
subject-speciﬁc training data. Further, Karras et al. use
professional actors capable of simulating emotional speech.
This enables them to add more realism in the upper face by
modeling motions (i.e. eyes and eyebrows) that are more
correlated with emotions than speech.

Animation control: Figure 7 demonstrates the possi-
bility of changing the identity dependent shape (top) and
head pose (bottom) during animation. Both rows are driven
by the same audio sequence. Despite the varying shape or
pose, the facial animation looks realistic.

8. Discussion

While VOCA can be used to realistically animate a wide
range of adults faces from speech, it still lacks some of the
details needed for conversational realism. Upper face mo-
tions (i.e. eyes and eyebrows) are not strongly correlated
with the audio [33]. The causal factor is emotion, which
is absent in our data due the inherent difﬁculty of simulat-
ing emotional speech in a controlled capture environment.
Thus, VOCA learns the causal facial motions from speech,
which are mostly present in the lower face.
