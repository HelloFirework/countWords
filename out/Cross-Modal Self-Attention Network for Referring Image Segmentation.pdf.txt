Abstract

We consider the problem of referring image segmenta-
tion. Given an input image and a natural language ex-
pression, the goal is to segment the object referred by the
language expression in the image. Existing works in this
area treat the language expression and the input image sep-
arately in their representations. They do not sufﬁciently
capture long-range correlations between these two modali-
ties. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal self-attention
(CMSA) module that effectively captures the long-range
dependencies between linguistic and visual features. Our
model can adaptively focus on informative words in the re-
ferring expression and important regions in the input image.
In addition, we propose a gated multi-level fusion module
to selectively integrate self-attentive cross-modal features
corresponding to different levels in the image. This mod-
ule controls the information ﬂow of features at different lev-
els. We validate the proposed approach on four evaluation
datasets. Our proposed approach consistently outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods.

1. Introduction

Referring image segmentation is a challenging problem
at the intersection of computer vision and natural language
processing. Given an image and a natural language expres-
sion, the goal is to produce a segmentation mask in the im-
age corresponding to entities referred by the the natural lan-
guage expression (see Fig. 4 for some examples). It is worth
noting that the referring expression is not limited to specify-
ing object categories (e.g. “person”, “cat”). It can take any
free form language description which may contain appear-
ance attributes (e.g. “red”, “long”), actions (e.g. “standing”,
“hold”) and relative relationships (e.g. “left”, “above”), etc.
Referring image segmentation can potentially be used in a
wide range of applications, such as interactive photo editing
and human-robot interaction.

A popular approach (e.g. [10, 15, 22]) in this area is to

self-attention mechanism. It is composed of three joint operations:
self-attention over language (shown in red), self-attention over im-
age representation (shown in green), and cross-modal attention be-
tween language and image (shown in blue). The visualizations of
linguistic and spatial feature representations (in bottom row) show
that the proposed model can focus on speciﬁc key words in the
language and spatial regions in the image that are necessary to
produce precise referring segmentation masks.

use convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neu-
ral network (RNN) to separately represent the image and
the referring expression. The resultant image and language
representations are then concatenated to produce the ﬁnal
pixel-wise segmentation result. The limitation of this ap-
proach is that the language encoding module may ignore
some ﬁne details of some individual words that are impor-
tant to produce an accurate segmentation mask.

Some previous works (e.g. [17, 20]) focus on learning
multimodal interaction in a sequential manner. The visual

feature is sequentially merged with the output of LSTM-
based [8] language model at each step to infer a multimodal
representation. However, the multimodal interaction only
considers the linguistic and visual information individually
within their local contexts. It may not sufﬁciently capture
global interaction information essential for semantic under-
standing and segmentation.

In this paper, we address the limitations of aforemen-
tioned methods. We propose a cross-modal self-attention
(CMSA) module to effectively learn long-range dependen-
cies from multimodal features that represent both visual and
linguistic information. Our model can adaptively focus on
important regions in the image and informative keywords in
the language description. Figure 1 shows an example that
illustrates the cross-modal self-attention module, where the
correlations among words in the language and regions in the
image are presented. In addition, we propose a gated multi-
level fusion module to further reﬁne the segmentation mask
of the referred entity. The gated fusion module is designed
to selectively leverage multi-level self-attentive features.

In summary, this paper makes the following contribu-
tions: (1) A cross-modal self-attention method for refer-
ring image segmentation. Our model effectively captures
the long-range dependencies between linguistic and visual
contexts. As a result, it produces a robust multimodal
feature representation for the task.
(2) A gated multi-
level fusion module to selectively integrate multi-level self-
attentive features which effectively capture ﬁne details for
precise segmentation masks.
(3) An extensive empirical
study on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that our
proposed method achieves superior performance compared
with state-of-the-art methods.

2. Related Work

In this section, we review several lines of research related

to our work in the following ﬁelds.
Semantic segmentation:
Semantic segmentation has
achieved great advances in recent years. Fully convolu-
tional networks (FCN) [18] take advantage of fully convolu-
tional layers to train a segmentation model in an end-to-end
way by replacing fully connected layers in CNN with con-
volutional layers. In order to alleviate the down-sampling
issue and enlarge the semantic context, DeepLab [3] adopts
dilated convolution to enlarge the receptive ﬁeld and uses
atrous spatial pyramid pooling for multi-scale segmenta-
tion. An improved pyramid pooling module [30] further en-
hances the use of multi-scale structure. Lower level features
are explored to bring more detailed information to comple-
ment high-level features for generating more accurate seg-
mentation masks [1, 18, 21].
Referring image localization and segmentation: In re-
ferring image localization, the goal is to localize speciﬁc
objects in an image according to the description of a refer-

ring expression. It has been explored in natural language
object retrieval [11] and modelling relationship [9, 28]. In
order to obtain a more precise result, referring image seg-
mentation is proposed to produce a segmentation mask in-
stead of a bounding box. This problem was ﬁrst intro-
duced in [10], where CNN and LSTM are used to extract
visual and linguistic features, respectively. They are then
concatenated together for spatial mask prediction. To bet-
ter achieve word-to-image interaction, [17] directly com-
bines visual features with each word feature from a lan-
guage LSTM to recurrently reﬁne segmentation results. Dy-
namic ﬁlter [20] for each word further enhances this inter-
action. In [22], word attention is incorporated in the image
regions to model key-word-aware context. Low-level visual
features are also exploited for this task in [15], where Con-
volutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) [25] progressively reﬁnes
segmentation masks from high-level to low-level features
sequentially. In this paper, we propose to adaptively inte-
grate multi-level self-attentive features by the gated fusion
module.
Attention: Attention mechanism has been shown to be a
powerful technique in deep learning models and has been
widely used in various tasks in natural language process-
ing [2, 23] to capture keywords for context.
In the mul-
timodal tasks, word attention has been used to re-weight
the importance of image regions for image caption genera-
tion [26], image question answering [27] and referring im-
age segmentation [22]. In addition, attention is also used
for modeling subject, relationship and object [9] and for re-
ferring relationship comprehension [28]. The diverse atten-
tions of query, image and objects are calculated separately
and then accumulated circularly for visual grounding in [5].
Self-attention [23] is proposed to attend a word to all
other words for learning relations in the input sequence. It
signiﬁcantly improves the performance for machine trans-
lation. This technique is also introduced in videos to cap-
ture long-term dependencies across temporal frames [24].
Different from these works, we propose a cross-modal self-
attention module to bridge attentions across language and
vision.

3. Our Model

The overall architecture of our model is shown in Fig. 2.
Given an image and a referring expression as the query, we
ﬁrst use a CNN to extract visual feature maps at different
levels from the input image. Each word in the referring
expression is represented as a vector of word embedding.
Every word vector is then appended to the visual feature
map to produce a multimodal feature map. Thus, there is a
multimodal feature map for each word in the referring ex-
pression. We then introduce self-attention [23] mechanism
to combine the feature maps of different words into a cross-
modal self-attentive feature map. The self-attentive feature

Figure 2. An overview of our approach. The proposed model consists of three components including multimodal features, cross-modal
self-attention (CMSA) and a gated multi-level fusion. Multimodal features are constructed from the image feature, the spatial coordinate
feature and the language feature for each word. Then the multimodual feature at each level is fed to a cross-modal self-attention module
to build long-range dependencies across individual words and spatial regions. Finally, the gated multi-level fusion module combines the
features from different levels to produce the ﬁnal segmentation mask.

map captures rich information and long-range dependencies
of both linguistic and visual information of the inputs. In the
end, the self-attentive features from multiple levels are com-
bined via a gating mechanism to produce the ﬁnal features
used for generating the segmentation output.

Our model is motivated by several observations. First
of all,
in order to solve referring image segmentation,
we typically require detailed information of certain indi-
vidual words (e.g. words like “left”, “right”). Previous
works (e.g. [10, 15, 22]) take word vectors as inputs and use
LSTM to produce a vector representation of the entire refer-
ring expression. The vector representation of the entire re-
ferring expression is then combined with the visual features
for referring image segmentation. The potential limitation
of this technique is that the vector representation produced
by LSTM captures the meaning of the entire referring ex-
pression while missing sufﬁciently detailed information of
some individual words needed for the referring image seg-
mentation task. Our model addresses this issue and does not
use LSTM to encode the entire referring expression. There-
fore, it can better capture more detailed word-level informa-
tion. Secondly, some previous works (e.g. [17, 20]) process
each word in the referring expression and concatenate it
with visual features to infer the referred object in a sequen-
tial order using a recurrent network. The limitation is that
these methods only look at local spatial regions and lack the
interaction over long-range spatial regions in global con-
text which is essential for semantic understanding and seg-
mentation. In contrast, our model uses a cross-modal self-
attention module that can effectively model long-range de-
pendencies between linguistic and visual modalities. Lastly,
different from [15] which adopts ConvLSTM to reﬁne seg-
mentation with multi-scale visual features sequentially, the
proposed method employs a novel gated fusion module for
combining multi-level self-attentive features.

3.1. Multimodal Features

The input to our model consists of an image I and a refer-
ring expression with N words wn, n 2 1, 2, ..., N . We ﬁrst
use a backbone CNN network to extract visual features from
the input image. The feature map extracted from a speciﬁc
CNN layer is represented as V 2 RH⇥W ⇥Cv , where H,
W and Cv are the dimensions of height, width and feature
channel, respectively. For ease of presentation, we only use
features extracted from one particular CNN layer for now.
Later in Sec. 3.3, we present an extension of our method
that uses features from multiple CNN layers.

For the language description with N words, we encode
each word wn as a one-hot vector, and project it into a com-
pact word embedding represented as en 2 RCl by a lookup
table. Different from previous methods [10, 15, 22] that
apply LSTM to process the word vectors sequentially and
encode the entire language description as a sentence vector,
we keep the individual word vectors and introduce a cross-
modal self-attention module to capture long-range correla-
tions between these words and spatial regions in the image.
More details will be presented in Sec. 3.2.

In addition to visual features and word vectors, spatial
coordinate features have also been shown to be useful for
referring image segmentation [10, 15, 17]. Following prior
works, we deﬁne an 8-D spatial coordinate feature at each
spatial position using the implementation in [17]. The ﬁrst
3-dimensions of the feature map encode the normalized hor-
izontal positions. The next 3-dimensions encode normal-
ized vertical positions. The last 2-dimensions encode the
normalized width and height information of the image.

Finally, we construct a joint multimodal feature repre-
sentation at each spatial position for each word by concate-
nating the visual features, word vectors, and spatial coordi-
nate features. Let p be a spatial location in the feature map
V , i.e. p 2 {1, 2, ..., H ⇥ W }. We use vp 2 RCv to denote

10504

the “slice” of the visual feature vector at the spatial location
p. The spatial coordinate feature of the location p is denoted
as sp 2 R8. Thus we can deﬁne the multimodal feature fpn
corresponding to the location p and the n-th word as fol-
lows:

fpn = Concat✓ vp

||vp||2

,

en

||en||2

, sp◆

(1)

where || · ||2 denotes the L2 norm of a vector and Concat(·)
denotes the concatenation of several input vectors. The fea-
ture vector fpn encodes information about the combination
of a speciﬁc location p in the image and the n-th word
wn in the referring expression with a total dimension of
(Cv + Cl + 8). We use F = {fpn : 8p, 8n} to represent the
collection of features fpn for different spatial locations and
words. The dimension of F is N ⇥ H ⇥ W ⇥ (Cv + Cl + 8).

3.2. Cross-Modal Self-Attention

The multimodal feature F is quite large which may con-
tain a lot of redundant information. Additionally, the size
of F is variable depending on the number of words in the

to produce the segmentation output.
In recent years, the
attention mechanism [9, 22, 23, 26, 28] has been shown
to be a powerful technique that can capture important in-
formation from raw features in either linguistic or visual
representation. Different from above works, we propose a
cross-modal self-attention module to jointly exploit atten-
tions over multimodal features. In particular, inspired by the
success of self-attention [23, 24], the designed cross-modal
self-attention module can capture long-range dependencies
between the words in a referring expression and different
spatial locations in the input image. The proposed module
takes F as the input and produces a feature map that sum-
marizes F after learning the correlation between the lan-
guage expression and the visual context. Note that the size
of this output feature map does not depend on the number
of words present in the language description.

Given a multimodal feature vector fpn, the cross-modal
self-attention module ﬁrst produces a set of query, key and
value pair by linear transformations as qpn = Wqfpn ,
kpn = Wkfpn and vpn = Wvfpn at each spatial loca-
tion p and the n-th word, where {Wq, Wk, Wv} are part of
the model parameters to be learned. Each query, key and
value is reduced from the high dimension of multimodal
features to the dimension of 512 in our implementation,
i.e. Wq, Wk, Wv 2 R512⇥(Cv+Cl+8), for computation ef-
ﬁciency.

We compute the cross-modal self-attentive feature ˆvpn as

follows:

bvpn =Xp0 Xn0

ap,n,p0,n0 = Softmax(qT

p0n0 kpn)

ap,n,p0,n0 vp0n0 , where

(2)

(3)

where ap,n,p0,n0 is the attention score that takes into account
of the correlation between (p, n) and any other combina-
tions of spatial location and word (p0, n0).

Thenbvpn is transformed back to the same dimension as

fpn via a linear layer and is added element-wise with fpn
to form a residual connection. This allows the insertion of
this module into to the backbone network without breaking
its behavior [7]. The ﬁnal feature representation is average-
pooled over all words in the referring expression. These
operations can be summarized as:

bfp = avg-pooln(Wbvbvpn + fpn) = PN
n=1 (Wbvbvpn + fpn)
where Wbv 2 R(Cv+Cl+8)⇥512 andbfp 2 RCv+Cl+8. We use
bF = {bfp : 8p} to denote the collection ofbfp at all spatial
locations, i.e. bF 2 RH⇥W ⇥(Cv+Cl+8).

self-attentive features.

tively. The softmax operation is performed over each row which
indicates the attentions across each visual and language cell in the
multimodal feature. We visualize the internal linguistic and spa-
tial representations. Please refer to Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 4.4 for more
details.

3.3. Gated Multi-Level Fusion

The feature representation bF obtained from Eq. 4 is spe-

ciﬁc to a particular layer in CNN. Previous work [15] has
shown that fusing features at multiple scales can improve
the performance of referring image segmentation. In this
section, we introduce a novel gated fusion technique to in-
tegrate multi-level features.

Let dF (i) be the cross-modal self-attentive feature map

at the i-th level. Following [15], we use ResNet based
DeepLab-101 as the backbone CNN and consider feature
maps at three levels (i = 1, 2, 3) corresponding to ResNet

dimensions at different level i. At each level, we apply a
1 ⇥ 1 convolutional layer to make the channel dimensions
of different levels consistent and result in an output X (i).

For the i-th level, we generate a memory gate mi and a
reset gate ri (ri, mi 2 RHi⇥Wi ), respectively. These gates
play a similar role to the gates in LSTM. Different from
stage-wise memory updates [4, 8], the computation of gates
at each level is decoupled from other levels. The gates at
each level control how much the visual feature at each level
contributes to the ﬁnal fused feature. Each level also has a
contextual controller Gi which modulates the information
ﬂow from other levels to the i-th level. This process can be
summarized as:

In order to obtain the segmentation mask, we aggregate
the feature maps F i

convolutional layer followed by the sigmoid function. This
sequence of operations outputs a probability map (P ) indi-
cating the likelihood of each pixel being the foreground in

where Ω is the whole set of pixels in the image and m is m-
th pixel in it. We use the Adam algorithm [13] to optimize
the loss in Eq. 7.

4. Experiments

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the datasets and exper-
imental setup in Sec. 4.1. Then we present the main results
of our method and compare with other state-of-the-art in
Sec. 4.2. Finally, we perform detailed ablation analysis to
demonstrate the relative contribution of each component of
our proposed method in Sec. 4.3. We also provide visual-
ization and failure cases to help gain insights of our model
in Sec. 4.4.

4.1. Datasets and Setup

Implementation details: Following previous work [15, 17,
22], we keep the maximum length of query expression as 20
and embed each word to a vector of Cl = 1000 dimensions.
Given an input image, we resize it to 320 ⇥ 320 and use the
outputs of DeepLab-101 ResNet blocks Res3, Res4, Res5
as the inputs for multimodal features. The dimension used
in X (i) for gated fusion is ﬁxed to 500. The network is
trained with an initial learning rate of 2.5e 4 and weight
decay of 5e 4. The learning rate is gradually decreased
using the polynomial policy with power of 0.9. For fair
comparisons, the ﬁnal segmentation results are reﬁned by
DenseCRF [14].
Datasets: We perform extensive experiments on four refer-
ring image segmentation datasets: UNC [29], UNC+ [29],
G-Ref [19] and ReferIt [12].

The UNC dataset contains 19,994 images with 142,209
referring expressions for 50,000 objects. All images and
expressions are collected from the MS COCO [16] dataset
interactively with a two-player game [12]. Two or more
objects of the same object category appear in each image.

The UNC+ dataset is similar to the UNC dataset. but
with a restriction that no location words are allowed in the
referring expression.
In this case, expressions regarding
referred objects totally depend on the appearance and the
scene context. It consists of 141,564 expressions for 49,856
objects in 19,992 images.

The G-Ref dataset is also collected based on MS COCO.
It contains of 104,560 expressions referring to 54,822 ob-
jects from 26,711 images. Annotations of this dataset come
from Amazon Mechanical Turk instead of a two-player
game. The average length of expressions is 8.4 words which
is longer than that of other datasets (less than 4 words).

The ReferIt dataset is built upon the IAPR TC-12 [6]
dataset. It has 130,525 expressions referring to 96,654 dis-
tinct object masks in 19,894 natural images. In addition to
objects, it also contains annotations for stuff classes such as
water, sky and ground.
Evaluation metrics: Following previous work [15, 17, 22],
we use intersection-over-union (IoU ) and prec@X as the
evaluation metrics. The IoU metric is a ratio between inter-
section and union of the predicted segmentation mask and

4.2. Experimental Evaluation

Quantitative results: Table 1 presents comparisons of our
method with existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our pro-
posed method consistently outperforms all other methods
on all four datasets. The improvement is particularly signiﬁ-
cant on the more challenging datasets, such as UNC+ which
has no location words and G-Ref which contains longer and
richer query expressions. This demonstrates the advantage
of capturing long-range dependencies for cross-modal fea-
tures and capturing the referred objects based on expres-
sions by our model.
Qualitative results: Figure 4 shows some qualitative ex-
amples generated by our network. To better understand the
beneﬁt of multi-level self-attentive features, we visualize
the linguistic representation to show attention distributions
at different levels. For a given level, we get the collection of
the attention scores {ap,n,p0,n0 : 8p, 8n, 8p0, 8n0} in Eq. 3
and average over the dimensions p, p0 and n0. Thereby we
can get a vector of length N . We repeat this operation for
all three levels and ﬁnally obtain a matrix of 3 ⇥ N . This
matrix is shown in Fig. 4 (2nd column). We can see that the
attention distribution over words corresponding to a partic-
ular feature level is different. Features at higher levels (e.g.
l3) tend to focus on words that refer to objects (e.g. “suit-
l1, l2) tend
case”, “vase”). Features at lower levels (e.g.
to focus on words that refer to attributes (e.g. “black”) or
relationships (e.g. “bottom”, “second”).

4.3. Ablation Study

We perform additional ablation experiments on the UNC
dataset to further investigate the relative contribution of
each component of our proposed model.
Attention methods: We ﬁrst perform experiments on dif-
ferent attention methods for multimodal features. We al-
ternatively use no attention, word attention, pixel attention
and word-pixel pair attention by zeroing out the respective
components in Eq. 2. As shown in Table 2, the proposed
cross-modal self-attention outperforms all other attention
methods signiﬁcantly. This demonstrates the language-to-
vision correlation can be better learned together within our
cross-modal self-attention method.
Multimodal feature representation: This experiment
evaluates the effectiveness of the multimdoal feature rep-
resentation. Similar to the baselines, i.e. multimodal LSTM
interaction in [17] and convolution integration in [15], we
directly take the output of the Res5 of the network to test
the performance of multimodal feature representation with-
out the multi-level fusion. We use CMSA-W to denote
the proposed method in Sec. 3.2.
In addition, a variant
method CMSA-S which also uses the same cross-modal
self-attentive feature, instead encodes the whole sentence
to one single language vector by LSTM.

As shown in Table 3 (top 4 rows), the proposed cross-
modal self-attentive feature based approaches achieve sig-
niﬁcantly better performance than other baselines. More-
over, the word based method CMSA-W outperforms sen-
tence based method CMSA-S for multimodal feature repre-
sentation.
Multi-level feature fusion: This experiment veriﬁes the
relative contribution of the proposed gated multi-level
fusion module.
Here we use our cross-modal self-
attentive features as inputs and compare with several well-
known feature fusion techniques, such as Deconv [21] and
PPM [30] in semantic segmentation and ConvLSTM [15] in
referring image segmentation.

In order to clearly understand the beneﬁt of our fusion
method, we also develop another self-gated method that
uses the same gate generation method in Sec. 3.3 to gener-
ate memory gates and directly multiply by its own features

Table 3. Ablation study on the UNC val set. The top four methods compare results of different methods for multimodal feature represen-
tations. The bottom ﬁve results show comparisons of multi-level feature fusion methods. CMSA and GF denote the proposed cross-modal
self-attention and gated multi-level fusion modules. All methods use the same base model (DeepLab-101) and DenseCRF for postprocess-
ing. ∗The numbers for [15] are slightly higher than original numbers reported in their paper which did not use DenseCRF postprocessing.

without interactions with features from other levels. As pre-
sented in the bottom 5 rows in Table 3, the proposed gated
multi-level fusion outperforms these other multi-scale fea-
ture fusion methods.

4.4. Visualization and Failure Cases

Visualization: We visualize spatial feature representations
with various query expressions for a given image. This
helps to gain further insights on the learned model.

We adopt the same technique in [15] to generate visual-
ization heatmaps over spatial locations. It is created by nor-
malizing the strongest activated channel of the last feature

map, which is upsampled to match with the size of origi-
nal input image. These generated heatmaps are shown in
Fig. 5.
It can be observed that our model is able to cor-
rectly respond to different query expressions with various
categories, locations and relationships. For instance, in the
second row, when the query is “woman” and “umbrella”,
our model highlights every woman and umbrella in the im-
age. Similarly, when the query is “red”, it captures both the
red clothes and the red part of the umbrella. For a more spe-
ciﬁc phrase such as “a woman in a green coat”, the model
accurately identiﬁes the woman being referred to.

Failure cases: We also visualize some interesting failure

Figure 6. Some failure examples of our model: (a) original image;
(c) segmentation result; (c) ground truth. The failures are due to
factors such as language ambiguity (1st and 2nd rows), similar
object appearance (3rd row) and occlusion (4th row).

cases in Fig. 6. These failures are caused by the ambiguity
of the language (e.g. two boys on right in the 1st example
and the feet in the 2nd example), similar object appearance
(e.g. car vs cab in the 3rd example), and occlusion (the
wheel of the motorbike in the 4th example). Some of these
failure cases can potentially be ﬁxed by applying object de-
tectors.

5. Conclusion

We have proposed cross-modal self-attention and gated
multi-level fusion modules to address two crucial chal-
lenges in the referring image segmentation task. Our cross-
modal self-attention module captures long-range dependen-
cies between visual and linguistic modalities, which results
in a better feature representation to focus on important in-
formation for referred entities.
In addition, the proposed
gated multi-level fusion module adaptively integrates fea-
tures from different levels via learnable gates for each in-
dividual level. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-
art results on all four benchmark datasets.
