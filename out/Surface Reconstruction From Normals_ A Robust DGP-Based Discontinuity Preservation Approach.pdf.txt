Abstract

In 3D surface reconstruction from normals, discontinu-
ity preservation is an important but challenging task. How-
ever, existing studies fail to address the discontinuous nor-
mal maps by enforcing the surface integrability in the con-
tinuous domain. This paper introduces a robust approach
to preserve the surface discontinuity in the discrete geom-
etry way. Firstly, we design two representative normal in-
compatibility features and propose an efﬁcient discontinuity
detection scheme to determine the splitting pattern for a dis-
crete mesh. Secondly, we model the discontinuity preserva-
tion problem as a light-weight energy optimization frame-
work by jointly considering the discontinuity detection and
the overall reconstruction error. Lastly, we further shrink
the feasible solution space to reduce the complexity based
on the prior knowledge. Experiments show that the pro-
posed method achieves the best performance on an exten-
sive 3D dataset compared with the state-of-the-arts in terms
of mean angular error and computational complexity.

1. Introduction

Surface reconstruction from normals is driven by sev-
eral computer vision tasks, such as shape from shading
(SfS), deﬂectometry, and photometric stereo (PS). Given a
static scene captured by a camera with ﬁxed viewpoint, PS
[15, 16, 20, 21] is widely used to obtain the surface nor-
mal orientations. To reconstruct a surface from the esti-
mated normals, the most common way [1, 3, 8, 11, 17] is to

conduct integration on the depth gradients which are trans-
formed from the normal orientations. However, the normal
map produced by PS may not be uniformly integrable, due
to occlusion boundary, sharp surface changes, or computa-
tion error. To reconstruct a surface from such a discontin-
uous and noisy normal map, Terzopoulos et al. [18] pro-
vided a compact framework to compute the depth ﬁeld and
surface discontinuity simultaneously, where a rough depth
map was needed for initialization. Approaches in [6, 7, 9]
used binary weights to indicate the presence of surface dis-
continuities, so that the integrability constraint can be ap-
plied partially. Although these methods can reconstruct sur-
faces from discontinuous and noisy normals, none of them
satisfactorily preserves the discontinuity, where the recon-
structed surfaces are somewhat distorted. One key reason is
that forming a discontinuity between two adjacent patches
requires breaking their connection. The aforementioned ap-
proaches assume that the number of total reconstructed ver-
texes is equal to the number of normal orientations, which
means every patch is connected, and distortion in the local
shape is propagated to the whole surface. Fig. 1 shows an
example of reconstructing the boundary vertexes of the Sad-
dle model, the object surface is split and can be separately
to form a more accurate shape.

In this paper, we concentrate on addressing the preser-
vation of the discontinuity feature in surface reconstruction

from normals. The input is a single normal map which can
be obtained by PS or point cloud, and the output is a 3D
surface with rich discontinuities. We study and model the
normal discontinuity in a discrete geometry domain [24]
which is used for surface reconstruction. To measure the
incompatibility between two adjacent normal orientations,
we introduce two new features, including absolute depth
difference and normal angle difference. The surface discon-
tinuities are detected by these two normal incompatibility
features, and followed by vertex partition and redistribution.
We build a geometry-based energy function to optimize the
discontinuity and the surface shape simultaneously. Be-
sides, the prior statistical knowledge of the normal incom-
patibility features greatly facilitates obtaining the optimal
result with low computation complexity. Extensive exper-
imental results (e.g., comparisons on 16 different models)
validate the efﬁciency of the proposed method.

Comparing to [24], the proposed method accurately re-
constructs the surface discontinuities by allowing the mesh
node to have multiple vertexes, rather than approximating
it in the continuous domain. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst approach to address the discontinuity prob-
lem in a discrete geometry way, which has the following
main merits:

• Discontinuity preservation: As two adjacent facets
oriented by incompatible normals are taken to be in-
dependent,
the discontinuity between them can be
formed along the breaking boundary. Meanwhile, as a
light-weight least-square optimization is used to com-
pute the depth map, and the surface smoothness on
continuous segments is preserved.

• Robustness to noise: This research can be applied to
the continuous/discontinuous normal maps with noise.
Examples with heavy Gaussian noise (e.g., variance up
to 8◦ angle degree) can be successfully reconstructed,
where discontinuities are still accurately distinguished
from noise and preserved.

• Parameter-tuning free: Due to the convexity of the
proposed surface energy model, the optimal parameter
used for discontinuity detection can be uniquely de-
termined. As a result, the proposed approach can be
adaptive to varying continuous/discontinuous normals
without parameter tuning.

2. Related Work

This paper aims to reconstruct a surface from normals
and allow the normal map to contain occlusion boundary,
discontinuities, and noise. Traditional approaches [6, 9, 13]
enforce the integrability constraint over the whole normal
map to estimate the depths, and can be mainly catego-
rized into regularization-based, weighting-based, and basis
function-based methods.

Regularization-based: Regularization method attempts to
smooth the depth gradients by introducing additional con-
straints. The most common way [4] is to use the least square
energy function which is deﬁned on residuals between the
depth difference and the depth gradient. Although it is
useful to noisy gradients, its quadratic behavior may over-
penalize discontinuities which have higher residuals. Meth-
ods in [2, 18] considered the discontinuity through a vari-
ational formulation where a rough depth map was needed
to estimate discontinuities and depth values simultaneously.
Petrovic et al. in [11] used a belief propagation to enforce
integrability constraints in Markov Random Field network.

Weighting-based: Instead of enforcing the regularization
uniformly over the whole gradient ﬁeld, methods in [6, 7]
employed the constraint partially by a weighting map,
where the weight values were designed to be inversely pro-
portional to the probability of lying on a discontinuity. An
extreme case is Mumford et al. [9], where a binary template
was used to indicate the presence of discontinuities. Stud-
ies in [12, 14, 19, 23] used an expectation maximization
method to estimate a weighted discontinuity map, and then
reconstructed the surface in segments according to the dis-
continuity labels. It is worth noting that all these methods
either require manually labeling or thresholding for edge
detection, thus cannot guarantee the reconstruction quality
for a general surface.

Basis function-based: Frankot and Chellappa [3] projected
the densely non-integrable gradients onto a set of Fourier
basis functions for enforcing surface integrability. Hsieh
et al. [5] and Karacali et al. [7] used wavelet basis func-
tions instead. Kovesi et al. [8] computed the correlations
of gradients via a bank of shapelets, which could solve the
gradients with a certain ambiguity by carefully parameter
tuning. One inevitable drawback of all these basis function-
based approaches is that the global integrability enforce-
ment constraint on the whole gradient ﬁeld can smooth out
the occlusion boundary. To address this problem, Wu et
al. in [10, 22] further developed to introduce the kernel ba-
sis function, but these approaches are limited to the normal
map of rectangular boundary and bring extremely computa-
tional complexity.

3. Discontinuity Detection

This research addresses the discontinuity problem based
on a discrete geometry processing (DGP) framework.
In
this section, we ﬁrst give a brief review of the DGP defor-
mation method, and discuss the difﬁculty of reconstructing
the surface discontinuities by the state-of-the-art method in
a discrete geometry way. Considering the characteristics
of DGP, we introduce two new features to measure the in-
compatibility between normals, and demonstrate how to use
these two features to detect discontinuities.

3.1. DGP-based Shape Deformation

In DGP deformation [24], the surface to be reconstructed
is taken as a mesh consisting of a set of micro square facets
oriented by the input normal map, and then a local/global
deformation is iteratively conducted on the mesh to gener-
ate the ﬁnal shape. Speciﬁcally, each pixel (i, j) in a nor-
mal map is converted into a facet fi,j bounded by four ver-
texes vi,j , vi,j+1, vi+1,j+1, and vi+1,j as shown in Fig. 3
(Left). A vertex vi,j has its x− and y−coordinates ﬁxed,
and z−coordinate (i.e., the depth value zi,j) as an unknown
variable to be determined.
In each iteration of the shape
deformation, a local shaping step is ﬁrst performed to deter-
mine the position of each facet according to its demanding
normal orientation. Meanwhile, a global blending step is
applied to generate all facets into a connected mesh surface.
The local/global steps can be summarized as a least square
formulation:

Φ (zi,j) = (cid:2)fi,j

(cid:2)z (fi,j) − p (fi,j)(cid:2)2,

depth values of
[zi,jzi,j+1zi+1,j+1zi+1,j]T , and p(fi,j) is the updated
depth values of z(fi,j) after employing the local shaping.
By iteratively solving Eq.
the depth converges to
form a surface whose orientations are expected to be the
same as the input normals. However, in [24], all facets are
supposed to be connected, and the reconstructed shape for
the discontinuous normals can be inevitably distorted as
shown in Fig. 1.

z−coordinate value is not unique. Let us denote it as
[z(1)
i,j ]T . The total number K should be greater than
one, and less or equal to the total number of facets around
vi,j. We enumerate all possible splittings for vi,j in Fig. 2,
which in general can be grouped into four types: I) vi,j has
a unique depth value, and four facets are connected and con-
tinuous; II) vi,j has two depth values, e.g., the ﬁrst group
separated by dotted line in Fig. 2. There are two cases in
this group: 1) Three facets are connected to one split vertex,
and the last one independently holds another vertex alone
(i.e., the ﬁrst four graphs); 2) Two pairs of adjacent facets1
are connected by one split vertex (i.e., the last two graphs
of the ﬁrst group); III) vi,j has three depth values, e.g., the
second group in Fig. 2. A pair of facets is connected to
one vertex, and the remaining two facets hold one vertex in-
dependently; IV) vi,j has four depth values, e.g., the third
group in Fig. 2, where every facet holds one independent
vertex. How to determine the splitting pattern for a vertex
vi,j is the main issue that this research is going to address
in the rest of this section.

3.2. Absolute Depth Difference Feature

An intuitive way to detect the compatibility between two
adjacent normals is to check whether the facets oriented by
them can be connected. Let us consider a patch Pi,j consist-
ing of 2 × 2 facets and centering at vi,j as shown in Fig. 3
(Middle). If there are two adjacent conﬂicting orientations,
the associated two facets are divided along the z−axis but
still hold the joint vertex vi,j as illustrated in Fig. 4. It is
observed that the depth difference between these two split

1In this paper, “adjacent” refers to “adjacent but non-diagonal”. We
do not consider the discontinuity on the diagonal joints due to its weak
connection relationship.

where ℓ has the four directions in Pi,j as shown in Fig. 3
(Right), which is a unit vector of directions of the x− and
y− axis in the Cartesian coordinate. k is a unit vector of the
positive direction of the z− axis. nl and nr are the left and
right normal orientations along the direction ℓ at vi,j.

Fig. 5 shows the statistics of the ADD feature for all con-
tinuous Pi,j from the Bunny model. One can see that there
is about 60% continuous Pi,j having a non-zero δ. In addi-
tion, the distribution of discontinuities for the non-zero δ is
also shown in Fig. 5 (Right). For a noise-free discontinuous
normal map, all facets are supposed to be connected except
for the occlusion boundary. In such a case, the normal dis-
continuities are only caused by the occlusion boundaries,
which indicate that detecting the non-zero δ can be an ef-
fective measure to ﬁnd discontinuities. However, this con-
dition is too restrict for a real case where the normal map
is obtained by PS or from a set of noisy point cloud. The
computational error introduced by PS and the scanning er-
ror in the point cloud disturb the normal orientations, and
produce the non-zero δ on the Pi,j which is expected to be
continuous. It is obvious that the detection method based on
a single ADD feature cannot distinguish discontinuity from
noise as shown in Fig. 5 (Right). To improve the detection
efﬁciency, a normal orientation feature is introduced in the
next section.

3.3. Normal Angle Difference Feature

In general, surface discontinuities are mainly caused by
the occlusion boundaries, where the ADD features are non-
zero, and there exists the sharp orientation changes. Thus,
both the non-zero δ and sharp orientation change are jointly
considered to detect the discontinuity. To better quantify
the change of orientations, a new feature called normal an-
gle difference (NAD) is deﬁned as the difference of normal

orientations within a certain range, as given in Eq. (3):

i,j =

(cid:2)θℓ

i,j > 0, and (cid:2)θℓ

i,j(cid:2)∞ ≡ θℓ

where ϕℓ

i,j is the NAD value along ℓ in Pi,j , and θℓ

i,j is,

i,j = [arccos(nl, nll), arccos(nl, nr), arccos(nr, nrr)]T ,
θℓ
(4)
where nll and nrr are the left-adjacent and right-adjacent
normals of nl and nr respectively as shown in Fig. 3
(Right). (cid:2) · (cid:2)±∞ is the ±∞-norm, which can be consid-
ered as the maximum/minimum operation.

3.4. Overall Detection Algorithm

The discontinuity detection that comprehensively con-
siders both the ADD feature and the NAD feature can be
implemented as:

Step 1) If δℓ

i,j is smaller than a given threshold τδ, then
it is needed to check whether ϕℓ
i,j exists or not.
Otherwise, Pi,j is discontinuous along the di-
rection ℓ.

Step 2) If ϕℓ

i,j exists, it is needed to check the rela-
tionship between ϕℓ
i,j and another threshold τϕ.
Otherwise, Pi,j is continuous along the direc-
tion ℓ.

Step 3) If ϕℓ

i,j is bigger than τϕ, then Pi,j is discontin-
uous along the direction ℓ. Otherwise, Pi,j is
continuous along the direction ℓ.

Step 4) After all four directions are detected, the ﬁnal
splitting pattern of Pi,j is determined as follows:
If two directions are detected as discontinuities
for a Pi,j, then the splitting pattern is shown
in the ﬁrst group of Fig. 2; Similarly, if three
and four directions are detected as discontinu-
ities for a Pi,j , the associated splitting patterns
are shown in the second and third group of Fig.
2, respectively.

Since vi,j can be split according to the discontinuity detec-
tion condition, z(fi,j) in Eq. (1) is updated as z(fi,j) =
[zk1
i,j+1]T . The superscript k repre-
sents the kth depth value along the z-axis.

overall surface reconstruction error. We also discuss how to
efﬁciently compute the optimal detection parameters based
on the prior knowledge.

4.1. Surface Reconstruction Optimization

In practice, it is infeasible to specify a different (cid:4)τδ, τϕ(cid:5)
for each Pi,j . For instance, considering that for a normal
map with resolution of W ×H, the total number of unknown
detection parameters is 2×(W × H). To compute these un-
known parameters, it greatly complicates the reconstruction
process. Thus, we proposed to uniformly apply (cid:4)τδ, τϕ(cid:5) to
the whole normal ﬁeld, and the reconstruction energy model
with respect to τδ and τϕ can be formulated as,

argmin{zk

i,j }E(M (τδ, τϕ)) s.t. n(fi,j) ≡ ni,j,

(5)

where M (τδ, τϕ) is the reconstructed mesh surface by Eq.
(1), with the input normals whose discontinuities have been
detected and meshed by τδ and τϕ (e.g., see Section 3.4).
E(M ) is a function measuring the shape variation, and n(·)
returns the normal vector of a facet.

Fig. 6 shows the energy surfaces of four discontinuous
models with the original normals and the noisy normals, re-
spectively. It can be seen that a large (cid:4)τδ, τϕ(cid:5) results in a
big reconstruction error. The reason is that when there are
no discontinuities detected under the large detection param-
eters, M (·) is taken to be continuous. Strictly speaking,
[24] is a special case of this research with in-
Xie et al.
ﬁnite (cid:4)τδ, τϕ(cid:5).
In addition, the result of a small (cid:4)τδ, τϕ(cid:5)
is another extreme case where every Pi,j is determined to
be discontinuous, and every fi,j is separated. In this case,
the total number of unknown depth values is larger than the
total number of normals, and Eq. (5) has no feasible solu-
tion. Consequently, the reasonable (cid:4)τδ, τϕ(cid:5) candidates are
located in the middle range as shown in Fig. 6.

which is computed by Eq. (2). An example of the histogram
of δ for the Bunny model is given in Fig. 7. It can be seen
that the ADD values are mainly concentrated in a narrow
range with the mean value close to zero, and the rest are
randomly distributed in a wide range with the upper limit
approaching to the largest depth of the ground-truth. Sup-
posing the ADD value with the largest probability is de-
noted as δ0 (i.e. the x− coordinate of the ﬁrst bar in Fig. 7).
A reasonable τδ is expected to be capable of ﬁltering every
Pi,j of δ0 to avoid being disconnected. As a result, τδ can
only be the value bigger than δ0.

If the peaks of hδ and gδ are close, the optimal τ ∗
δ should be
larger than the mean value μδ of gδ. If the peaks of hδ and
gδ are far away from each other, it implies that the normal
map contains heavy noise, which causes the distribution of
δ diverging. Thus, in this research, the search range of the

The distribution of the NAD feature is similar to that of
the ADD feature, i.e., mainly concentrated near small ϕ.
Thus, the search range of the optimal τ ∗
ϕ can be derived in a
similar way. The difference is that we do not make analysis

on all values of ϕ = (cid:6)ϕℓ

i,j(cid:7) to compute the histogram hϕ.
As we know that the patch, Pi,j having the largest probabil-
ity δ0, must be continuous, and the associated NAD feature
ϕ|δ0 rarely contains the optimal τ ∗
ϕ. That is, the optimal τ ∗
ϕ
is impossible to be ϕ with the largest probability over the
range of ϕ|δ0 . Eq. (7) gives the mathematical formulation
of the search range of τ ∗
ϕ,

Ωϕ = (cid:8) (μϕ, (cid:2)ϕ|δ0 (cid:2)∞), hϕ(μϕ) ≈ max(hϕ)

where hϕ is the histogram of ϕ|δ0 , μϕ and dϕ are the mean
and variance of the Gaussian function gϕ, which is ﬁtted
from hϕ.

To illustrate the effectiveness of Ωδ and Ωϕ, we deﬁne
the range reduction ratio as λ = |Ωδ|
, and test the
(cid:5)δ(cid:5)∞
proposed scheme on the Face model containing different
noisy levels, and under the normals of 16 different models.
The optimal detection parameters τ ∗
ϕ are efﬁciently
computed by the Monte Carlo method. As shown in Fig.
8, the searching scope can be shrunk to about 15% of the
original one, even for the Face normals containing Gaussian
noise of variance up to 8◦. The corresponding reconstruc-
tion error is provided in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, where the mean
angular error is close to 0◦.

5. Experimental Results

We implement the proposed approach in MATLAB un-
der Intel i7 CPU with 3.40GHz and 8GB RAM, and com-
pare the performance with ﬁve existing methods as men-
tioned in [13], including Quadratic [4], Fourier [3], Mum-
ford Shah [9], Shapelete [8], and DGP shaping [24]. All
the test examples are downloaded from Aim@Shape, and
TurboSquid. For each 3D model, we ﬁrst sample the nor-
mal vectors, render them via OpenGL, and then read back
the associated depth map and the sampled normal map. To
introduce the discontinuous artifacts into the tested exam-
ples, we simply introduce [0, 0, 1]T as surface normals in
the regions where orientations are missing. For compari-
son, the input normal map serves as the ground-truth, where
the angular errors between the input normals and the recon-
structed ones are computed to measure the quality of recon-
struction. Experimental results show that our approach is
efﬁcient and outperforms the other ﬁve methods. Detailed
comparison and analysis are discussed as below.

Firstly, our approach is robust not only for the original
normal maps, but also for the noisy ones. As shown in Fig.
9, the Face model containing the Gaussian noise with dif-
ferent variances ranging from 0◦ to 8◦ is used to test the

robustness of our method2.
It can be seen that when the
variance is increasing but less than 6◦, the reconstruction er-
ror rate and mean angular error (MAE) [24] are kept below
5% and 5◦, respectively. When the variance increases to 8◦,
the error rate and MAE are still below 10% and 10◦ respec-
tively, which are much smaller than the other ﬁve methods.
The related reconstructed surfaces are rendered in Fig. 12.
It is clearly shown that all noisy cases of Face are satisfac-
torily separated from the background and accurately recon-
structed.

Secondly, we also validate our approach on the Bunny
and the Hand models as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 14,
respectively. Each example is conducted on two types of
inputs, the original normal map and the noisy one.
It is
obvious that all the other compared methods fail to break
the discontinuous patches, thereby distort the reconstructed
surface. We also observe that some methods are very sen-
sitive to noise. For example, the reconstructed surfaces by
Shapelete [8] fail to be rendered in the comparison as the
errors are too large (see Fig. 9). In addition, we show more

variance of 8◦.

comparisons on 16 different models in Fig. 10. Obviously,
the proposed method achieves the best performance. For
the original normal maps, the reconstruction error rate and
MAE are close to 0% and 0◦, respectively. For the noisy
counterparts, the reconstruction error rate and MAE are be-
low 5% and 5◦. All the other reconstruction results of our
method are rendered and shown in Fig. 15.

Thirdly, we qualitatively evaluate our approach on three
real-world PS normal models, including Turtle from the
Harvard dataset, Cat and Bear from the DiLiGenT dataset,
as shown in Fig. 13. The reconstructed mean angular errors
are 2.16◦, 4.13◦, and 6.01◦, respectively. It is worth noting
that it is usually to remove the dark background to guarantee
the reconstruction quality of computing normal by the tradi-
tional methods. Here, we still use the noisy (non-Gaussian)
and unreliable background in the reconstructions of Cat and
Bear.

Last but not the least, the proposed scheme can be efﬁ-
ciently solved. The reason is that Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) deﬁne

an effective feasible solution space of (cid:4)τ ∗

normals. Especially, for a noisy normal map, the solution
space is shrinking along with the increasing Gaussian vari-
ance. It means our approach can guarantee the reconstruc-

ϕ(cid:5) for different

tion efﬁciency for the noisy inputs without adding overhead
complexity, which is validated in Fig. 8. The reconstruction
time cost and the reduction rate of the searching range for
the Face model with the different amount of noise are also
plotted. It is observed that the time cost keeps the similar
trend for different noises.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we present an approach to address the prob-
lem of discontinuity preservation based on a discrete frame-

work in surface reconstruction from normals. To determine
the appropriate splittings of a discrete mesh, we introduce
two new normal incompatibility features and design an efﬁ-
cient discontinuity detection scheme. In addition, we model
the discontinuity preservation as a light-weight energy op-
timization problem, and shrink the feasible solution space
to reduce the computation complexity based on the prior
knowledge. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed method reconstructs various discontinuous sur-
faces efﬁciently and robustly.
