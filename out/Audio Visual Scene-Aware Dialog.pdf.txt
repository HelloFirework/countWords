Abstract

We introduce the task of scene-aware dialog. Our goal is
to generate a complete and natural response to a question
about a scene, given video and audio of the scene and the
history of previous turns in the dialog. To answer success-
fully, agents must ground concepts from the question in the
video while leveraging contextual cues from the dialog his-
tory. To benchmark this task, we introduce the Audio Visual
Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD) Dataset. For each of more
than 11,000 videos of human actions from the Charades
dataset, our dataset contains a dialog about the video, plus
a ﬁnal summary of the video by one of the dialog partici-
pants. We train several baseline systems for this task and
evaluate the performance of the trained models using both
qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our results indicate
that models must utilize all the available inputs (video, au-
dio, question, and dialog history) to perform best on this
dataset.

1. Introduction

Developing conversational agents has been a longstand-
ing goal of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). For many human-
computer interactions, natural language presents an ideal in-
terface, as it is fully expressive and requires no user training.
One emerging area is the development of visually aware di-
alog systems. Das et al. [6] introduced the problem of vi-
sual dialog, in which a model is trained to carry out a con-
versation in natural language, answering questions about an
image. For a given question, the system has to ground its
response in the input image as well as the previous utter-
ances. However, conversing about a static image is inher-
ently limiting. Many potential applications for conversa-
tional agents, such as virtual personal assistants and assis-
tive technologies for the visually impaired, would beneﬁt
greatly from understanding the scene in which the agent is
operating. This context often cannot be captured in a sin-

Figure 1: In Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog, an agent’s task
is to answer natural language questions about a short video. The
agent grounds its responses on the dynamic scene, the audio, and
the history (previous rounds) of the dialog, dialog history, which
begins with a short script of the scene.

gle image, as there is important information in the temporal
dynamics of the scene as well as in the audio.

Our goal is to move towards conversational agents that are
not only visually intelligent but also aware of temporal dy-
namics. For example, a security guard (G) might have the
following exchange with an AI agent: “G: Has there been
anyone carrying a red handbag in the last week in Sector 5?
AI: Yes, a woman in a blue suit. G: Do any of the exit cam-
eras show her leaving with it? AI: No. G: Did anyone else
pick it up?”. Answering such questions requires a holis-
tic understanding of the visual and audio information in the
scene, including temporal dynamics. Since human commu-
nication is rarely single-shot, an understanding of sequential
dialog (e.g., what her and it refer to) is also required.

We introduce the task of scene-aware dialog, as well as the

Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) Dataset to pro-
vide a means for training and testing scene-aware dialog
systems. In the general task of scene-aware dialog, the goal
of the system is to carry on a conversation with a human
about a temporally varying scene.
In the AVSD Dataset,
we are addressing a particular type of scene-aware dialog.
Each dialog in the dataset is a sequence of question/answer
(QA) pairs about a short video; each video features a person
performing everyday activities in a home environment.

We deﬁned a speciﬁc task for the scene-aware dialog sys-
tem to learn: Given an input video, the history of a dialog
about the video (consisting of a short script plus the ﬁrst
t−1 QA pairs), and a follow-up question (the tth question
in the dialog), the system’s goal is to generate a correct re-
sponse to the follow-up question. We aim to use the dataset
to explore the compositionality of dynamic scenes and to
train an end-to-end model to leverage information from the
video frames, audio signals, and dialog history. The sys-
tem should engage in this conversation by providing com-
plete and natural responses to enable real-world applicabil-
ity. The development of such scene-aware conversational
agents represents an important frontier in artiﬁcial intelli-
gence. In addition, it holds promise for numerous practical
applications, such as video retrieval from users’ free-form
queries, and helping visually impaired people understand
visual content. Our contributions include the following:

1. We introduce the task of scene-aware dialog, which is a

multimodal semantic comprehension task.

2. We introduce a new benchmark for the scene-aware di-
alog task, the AVSD Dataset, consisting of more than
11,000 conversations that discuss the content (including
actions, interactions, sound, and temporal dynamics) of
videos of human-centered activities.

3. We analyze the performance of several baseline systems

on this new benchmark dataset.

2. Related Work

Video Datasets:
In the domain of dynamic scene un-
derstanding, a large body of literature focuses on action
classiﬁcation.
Some important benchmarks for video-
action recognition and detection are: HMDB51 [15] Sports-
1M [12] and UCF-101 [27]. The ActivityNet [3] and Kinet-
ics [13] datasets target a broader range of human-centered
action categories. Sigurdsson et al. [25] presented the Cha-
rades dataset. Charades is a crowd-sourced video dataset
that was built by asking Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)
workers to write some scene scripts of daily activities, then
asking another group of AMT workers to record themselves
“acting out” the scripts in a “Hollywood style.” In our work,
Charades videos were used to collect conversations about
the activities in the videos. Video-based captioning is an-

other exciting research area, and there are several datasets
introduced to benchmark and evaluate this task [14, 24].

Video-based Question Answering: Inspired by the suc-
cess of image-based question answering [1, 9, 32, 34], re-
cent work has addressed the task of video-based question
answering [11,20,30]. MovieQA [16] and TVQA [30] eval-
uate the video-based QA task by training end-to-end mod-
els to answer multiple-choice questions by leveraging cues
from video frames and associated textual information, such
as scripts and subtitles. While this one-shot question an-
swering setting is more typical in existing work, we ﬁnd this
structure to be unnatural. Our focus in AVSD is on settings
involving multiple rounds of questions that require natural
free-form answers.

Visual Dialog: Our work is directly related to the image-
based dialog task (VisDial) introduced by Das et al. [6].
Given an input image, a dialog history, and a question, the
agent is required to answer the question while grounding
the answer on the input image and the dialog history. In [6],
several network architectures are introduced to encode the
different input modalities:
late fusion, hierarchical recur-
rent encoder, and memory network. In this work, we extend
the work from [6] to include additional complex modalities:
video frames and audio signals.

3. Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog Dataset

A primary goal of our paper is to create a benchmark for the
task of scene-aware dialog. There are several characteristics
that we desire for such a dataset: 1) The dialogs should fo-
cus on the dynamic aspects of the video (i.e., actions and
interactions); 2) The answers should be complete explana-
tory responses rather than brief one- or two-word answers
(e.g., not simply yes or no); 3) The dialogs should discuss
the temporal order of events in the video.

Video Content. An essential element to collecting video-
grounded dialogs is of course the videos themselves. We
choose to collect dialogs grounded in the Charades [25]
human-activity dataset. The Charades dataset consists of
11,816 videos of everday indoor human activities with an
average length of 30 seconds. Each video includes at least
two actions. Examples of frames and scripts for Charades
videos are shown in Figure 2. We choose the Charades
dataset for two main reasons. First, the videos in this dataset

the settings are natural and diverse. Second, each video con-

ers (Turkers) with rich content to discuss.

3.1. Data Collection

We adapt the real-time chat interface from [6] to pair two
AMT workers to have an English-language conversation
about a video from the Charades Dataset (Figure 2). One
person, the “Answerer,” is presented with the video clip and
the script, and their role is to provide detailed answers to
questions about the scene. The other person, the “Ques-
tioner,” does not have access to the video or the script, and
can only see three frames (one each from the beginning,
middle, and end) of the video. The Questioner’s goal is
to ask questions to obtain a good understanding of what
happens in the video scene. We considered several design
choices for the chat interface and instructions, in order to
encourage natural conversations about events in the videos.

Investigating Events in Video. To help distinguish this
task from previous image and video captioning tasks, our
instructions direct the Questioner to “investigate what is
happening” rather than simply asking the two Turkers to
“chat about the video.” We ﬁnd that when asked to “chat
about the video,” Questioners tend to ask a lot of questions
about the setting and the appearance of the people in the
video. In contrast, the direction “investigate what is hap-
pening” leads Questioners to inquire more about the actions
of the people in the video.

Seeding the Conversation. There are two reasons that our
protocol provides the Questioners with three frames before
the conversation starts: First, since the images provide the

roles of “Questioner” and “Answerer.”

overall layout of the scene, they ensure that the conversa-
tions are centered around the actions and events that take
place in the video rather than about the scene layout or the
appearance of people and objects. Second, we found that
providing multiple frames instead of a single frame encour-
aged users to ask about the sequence of events. Providing
the Questioners with these three images achieves both cri-
teria without explicitly dictating Questioners’ behavior; this
is important because we want the conversations to be as nat-
ural as possible.

Downstream Task: Video Summarization. Once the con-
versation (sequence of 10 QA pairs) between the Questioner
and Answerer is complete, the Questioner’s ﬁnal task is to
summarize what they think happened in the video. Know-
ing that this will be their ﬁnal task motivates the Questioner
to ask good questions that will lead to informative answers
about the events in the video. In addition, this ﬁnal down-
stream task is used to evaluate the quality of the dialog and
how informative it was about the video. Figure 3 shows the
list of instructions provided to AMT workers.

Worker Qualiﬁcations. To ensure high-quality and ﬂu-
ent dialogs, we restrict our tasks on AMT to Turkers with
≥ 95% task acceptance rates, located in North America,
who have completed at least 500 tasks already. We fur-
ther restrict any one Turker from completing more than 200
tasks in order to maintain diversity. In total, 1553 unique
workers contributed to the dataset collection effort.

Table 1 puts the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD)
Dataset in context with several other video question answer-
ing benchmarks. While AVSD has fewer unique video clips
compared to TVQA and MovieQA, which are curated from
television and ﬁlm, our videos are more naturalistic. More-
over, AVSD contains a similar number of questions and an-
swers, but as a part of multi-round dialogs.

Does he do anything after he throws the

after folding them? What does he do after lock-
ing the door?

Likewise, we see that questions such as “What happens ...”
and “What does he do ...” occur frequently in the dataset,
as shown in Figure 5b.

Dataset Quality. In order to further evaluate dialog qual-
ity, we ran another study where we asked AMT workers to
watch and summarize the videos from the AVSD Dataset.
The instruction was “Summarize what is happening in the
video”. We collected 4 summaries per video and used the
BLEU [21], ROUGE [17], METEOR [2] and CIDEr [31]
metrics to compare the summaries collected from the video-
watcher to the ones provided by the questioners at the end
of each conversation.
In Table 2, the ﬁrst row evaluates
a randomly selected video-watcher summary vs. three oth-
ers, and the second row evaluates the Questioner’s summary
vs. the same three other video-watcher summaries. Both
these numbers are close, demonstrating that the Question-
ers do gain an understanding of the scene from the dialog
that is comparable to having watched the video.

4. Model

To demonstrate the potential and the challenges of this new
dataset, we design and analyze a video-dialog answerer
model. The model takes as input a video, the audio track
of the video, a dialog history (which comprises the ground-
truth script from the Charades dataset and the ﬁrst t−1 QA
pairs of the dialog), and a follow-up question (the tth ques-
tion in the dialog). The model should ground the question
in both the video and its audio, and use the dialog history to
leverage contextual information in order to answer.

Moving away from the hierarchical or memory network
encoders common for dialog tasks [6], we opt to present
a straightforward, discriminative late-fusion approach for
scene-aware dialog that was recently shown to be effective
for visual dialog [10]. This choice also enables a fair abla-
tion study for the various input modalities, an important en-
deavour when introducing such a strongly multimodal task.
For this class of model architecture, increases or decreases
in performance from input ablation are directly linked to
the usefulness of the input rather than to any complications
introduced by the choice of network structure (e.g., some
modalities having many more parameters than others).

ing, 1,863 validation, and 1,968 testing), each including a
video summary (written by the Questioner after each dia-
log). There are a total of 118,160 question/answer (QA)
pairs. Figure 4 shows an example from our dataset. More
examples can be found in the supplementary section.

Lengths of Questions and Answers. We compare the
length of AVSD questions and answers with those from Vis-
Dial [6] in Figure 5c. Note that the answers and questions
in AVSD are longer on average. The average length for
AVSD questions and answers is 7.9 and 9.4 words, respec-
tively. In contrast, VisDial questions average 5.1 words and
are answered in 2.9 words on average. This shows that the
dialogs in our dataset are more verbose and conversational.

In 57% of the conversations,
Audio-Related Questions.
there are questions about the audio, such as whether there
was any music or noise, or whether the people were talking.
Here are some examples of these audio-related questions
from the dataset:

Does she appear to talk to anyone? Do you
hear any noise in the background? Is there any
music? Is there any other noise like a TV or
music?

Moreover, looking at the burst diagram for questions in Fig-
ure 5b we can see that questions like “Can / Do you hear ...”
and “Is there any sound ...” appear frequently in the dataset.

Temporal Questions. Another common type of questions
is about what happened next. In fact, people asked ques-
tions about what happened next in more that 70% of the
conversations. As previously noted, the investigation of the
temporal sequence of events was implicitly encouraged by
our experimental protocol, such as providing the Questioner
with three image frames from different parts of the video.
Here are some examples of such questions, taken from dif-
ferent conversations:

An overview of our model is shown in Figure 6. At a high
level, the network operates by fusing information from all
of the modalities into a ﬁxed-size representation, then com-
paring this state with a set of candidate answers, selecting
the most closely matching candidate as the output answer.
In the rest of this section, we provide more details of the
model and the input encodings for each modality.

Input Representations. The AVSD Dataset provides a
challenging multimodal reasoning task including natural
language, video, and audio. We describe how we represent
each of these as inputs to the network. These correspond to
the information that was available to the human Answerer
in round t of a dialog.

• Video Script (S): Each dialog in AVSD starts with a short
natural language description of the video contents (i.e., the
Charades ground-truth script).

At

(S) and each of

the initial video script

• Dialog History (DH): The dialog history consists
of
the
question-answer pairs from previous rounds of dia-
round t, we write the dialog history as
log.
DHt=(S, Q0, A0, Q1, A1, . . . Qt−1, At−1). We concate-
nate the elements of the dialog history and encode them
using an LSTM trained along with the late-fusion model.
• Question (Q): The question to be answered, also known
as Qt. The question is encoded by an LSTM trained along
with the late-fusion model.

• Middle Frame (I): In some ablations, we represent
videos using only their middle frame to eliminate all tem-
poral information, in order to evaluate the role of tempo-
ral visual reasoning. In these cases, we encode the frame
using a pretrained VGG-16 network [26] trained on Ima-
geNet [7].

• Video (V): Each AVSD dialog is grounded in a video
that depicts people performing simple actions. We trans-

form the video frames into a ﬁxed sized feature using the
popular pretrained I3D model [4]. I3D is a 3D convolu-
tional network that achieved state-of-the-art performance
on multiple popular activity recognition tasks [15, 27].

• Audio (A): We similarly encode the audio track from the
video using a pretrained AENet [29]. AENet is a convo-
lutional audio encoding network that operates over long-
time-span spectrograms.
It has been shown to improve
activity recognition when combined with video features.

Encoder Network. In order to combine the features from
these diverse inputs, we follow recent work in visually
grounded dialog [10]: simply concatenate the features, and
allow fusion to occur through fully-connected layers. More
concretely, we can write our network as:

ht = LSTM(DH)

i = I3D(V)

qt = LSTM(Q)
a = AENet(A)

z = concat(ht, qt, i, a)
en = tanh (Pk wk,n × zk + bn) ,

where ht, qt, i, and a are the dialog history, question, video,
and audio feature embeddings described above. The embed-
dings are concatenated to form the vector z, which is passed
through a linear layer with a tanh activation to form the joint
embedding vector e. (Here k and n respectively index ele-
ments of the vectors z and e.) For any of our ablations of
these input modalities, we simply train a network excluding
that input, without adjusting the linear layer output size.

Decoder Model. We approach this problem as a discrimi-
native ranking task, selecting an output from a set of can-
didate options, since these approaches have proven to be
stronger than their generative counterparts in visual dia-
log [6].
(However, we note that generative variants need
not rely on a ﬁxed answer pool and may be more useful in

embedding that is used to rank candidate answers.

general deployment.) More concretely, given a set of 100
potential answers {A(1)
, . . . , A(100)
}, the agent learns to
pick the most appropriate response.

The decoder computes the inner product between a candi-
date answer embedded with an LSTM and the holistic input
embedding e generated by the encoder. We can write the
decoder as:

at,i = LSTM(A(i)
t )
st,i = < at,i, e >

where at,i is the embedding vector for answer candidate
A(i)
, the notation < ·, · > represents an inner product, and
st,i is the score computed for the candidate based on its sim-
ilarity to the input encoding e. We repeat this for all of the
candidate answers, then pass the results through a softmax
layer to compute probabilities of all of the candidates. At
training time, we maximize the log-likelihood of the correct
answer. At test time, we simply rank candidates according
to their probabilities and select the argmax as the best re-
sponse.

Selecting Candidate Answers. Following the selection
process in [6], the set of 100 candidates answers consists of
four types of answers: the ground-truth answer, hard nega-
tives that are ground-truth answers to similar questions (but
different video contexts), popular answers, and answers to
random questions. We ﬁrst sample 50 plausible answers
which are the ground-truth answers to the 50 most similar
questions. We are looking for questions that start with sim-
ilar tri-grams (i.e., are of the same type such as “what did
he”) and mention similar semantic concepts in the rest of the
question. To accomplish this, all the questions are embed-
ded in a common vector space. The question embedding is
computed by concatenating the GloVe [22] embeddings of
the ﬁrst three words with the averaged GloVe embedding of

the remaining words in the question. We then use Euclidean
distance to select the closest neighbor questions to the orig-
inal question. Those sampled answers are considered as
hard negatives, because they correspond to similar ques-
tions that were asked in completely different contexts (dif-
ferent video, audio and dialog). In addition, we select the
30 most popular answers from the dataset. By adding pop-
ular answers, we force the network to distinguish between
purely likely answers and plausible responses for the spe-
ciﬁc question, which increases the difﬁculty of the task. The
next 19 candidate answers are sampled from the ground-
truth answers to random questions in the dataset. The ﬁnal
candidate answer is the ground-truth (human-generated) an-
swer from the original dialog.

Implementation Details. Our implementation is based on
the visual dialog challenge starter code [8]. The VisDial
repository also provides code and model to extract image
features. We extract video features using the I3D model [4].
Repository [23] provides code and models ﬁne-tuned on the
Charades dataset to extract I3D video features. We subsam-
ple 40 frames from the original video and feed them into the
RGB pipeline of the I3D model. The frames are sampled to
be equally spaced in time. For the audio features, we use
the AEnet network [29]. The repository [35] provides code
to extract features from an audio signal. We ﬁrst extract the
audio track from the original Charades videos and convert
them into 16kHz, 16bit, mono-channel signals. Both the
video and audio features have the same dimension (4096).

5. Experiments

Data Splits. Recall from Section 3 that the AVSDv1.0
dataset contains 11,816 instances split across training
(7,985), validation (1,863), and testing (1,968) correspond-

model performance, adding the dialog history provides the
best language-only model performance of 4.72 mean rank.

Evaluation Metrics. Although metrics like BLEU [21],
METEOR [2], and ROUGE [17] have been widely used
to evaluate dialog [19, 28, 33], there has been recent evi-
dence suggesting that they do not correlate well with human
judgment [18]. Like [6], we instead evaluate our models by
checking individual responses at each round in a retrieval or
multiple-choice setting. The agent is given a set of 100 an-
swer candidates (Section 4) and must select one. We report
the following retrieval metrics:

• Recall@k [higher is better] that measures how often the

ground truth is ranked in the top k choices

• Mean rank (Mean) [lower is better] of the ground truth
answer which is sensitive to overall tendencies to rank
ground-truth higher—important in our context as other
candidate answers may be equally plausible.

• Mean reciprocal rank (MRR) [higher is better] of the
ground truth answer, which values placing ground truth in
higher ranks more heavily.

We note that evaluation even in these retrieval settings for
dialog has many open questions. One attractive alternative
that we leave for future work is to evaluate directly with
human users in cooperative tasks [5].

6. Results and Analysis

In order to assess the challenges presented by the AVSDv1.0
dataset and the usefulness of different input modalities to
address them, we present comprehensive ablations of our
baseline model with respect to inputs. Table 3 reports the
results of our models on AVSDv1.0 test. We ﬁnd that our
best performing models are those that can leverage video,
audio, and dialog histories—signaling that the dialog col-
lected in AVSD is grounded in multi-modal observations.
In the rest of this section, we highlight noteworthy results.

Language-only Baselines. The ﬁrst four lines of Table 3
show the language-only models. First, the Answer Prior
model encodes each answer with an LSTM and scores it
against a static embedding vector learned over the entire
training set. This model lacks question information, cap-
tion, dialog history, or any form of perception, and acts
as a measure of dataset answer bias. Naturally, it per-
forms poorly over all metrics, though it does outperform
chance. We also examine a question-only model Q that se-
lects answers based only on the question encoding, a ques-
tion and a caption model Q+C, as well as a question and
dialog history Q+DH model that also includes the caption.
These models measure regularities between questions, di-
alogs, and answer distributions. We ﬁnd that access to
the question greatly improves performance over the answer
prior from 28.54 mean rank to 7.63 with question alone.
While caption encoding has no signiﬁcant impact on the

Dialog history is a strong signal. The dialog history ap-
pears to be a very strong signal – models with it consis-
tently achieve mean ranks in the 4–4.8 range even without
additional perception modalities, whereas models without
dialog history struggle to get below a mean rank of 7. This
makes sense, as dialogs are self-referential; in the AVSD
dataset, 55.2% of the questions contain co-reference words
such as her, they, and it. Such questions strongly depend on
the prior rounds of dialog, which are encoded in the DH.

We note that adding video and audio signals improves over
dialog history alone, by providing complementary informa-
tion to ground questions.

Temporal perception seems to matter. Adding video fea-
tures (V) consistently leads to improvements for all models.
To further tease apart the effect of temporal perception from
being able to see the scene in general, we run two ablations
where rather than the video features, we encode visual per-
ception using only the middle frame of the video. In both
cases, Q+I and Q+DH+I, we see that the addition of static
frames hurts performance marginally whereas addition of
video features leads to improvements. Thus, it seems that
whereas temporal perception is helpful, models with access
to just the middle image learn poorly generalizable ground-
ings. We point out that one confounding factor for this ﬁnd-
ing is that the image is encoded with a VGG network, rather
than the I3D encoding used for videos.

Audio provides a boost. The addition of audio features
generally improves model performance (Q+V to Q+V+A be-
ing the exception). Interestingly, we see that model perfor-
mance improves even more when combined with dialog his-
tory and video features (Q+DH+V+A) for some metrics, indi-

cating there is still complementary knowledge between the
video and audio signals despite their close relationship.

Temporal and Audio-Based Questions. Table 5 shows
mean rank on subsets of questions. We ﬁlter the questions
using the two lists of keywords:
audio-related words
{talk, hear, sound, audio, music, noise} and temporal
words {after, before, beginning, then, end, start}. We
then generated answers to those questions using the three
different models Q, Q+A and Q+V and compared which one
would lead to higher rank of the ground truth answer.

Table 5: Mean rank results for the three models Q, Q+A, and Q+V
for audio-related questions and temporal questions.

For the audio-related questions, we can see that although
both the Q+A and Q+V outperform the Q model, the visual fea-
tures seem more useful. This can be easily balanced as it is
also unlikely that vision is unnecessary in audio questions.
However, answers to the temporal questions were much bet-
ter using the Q+V model, which conﬁrms our intuition. The

Q+A model helps only slightly (7.15 vs 7.31), but the Q+V
model yields more signiﬁcant improvement (5.98 vs 7.31).

The order of the questions/answers is important. An im-
portant question to ask is whether the questions and the an-
swers in the dialog are a set of independent question/answer
(QA) pairs, or are they strongly co-dependent? To answer
this question, we ran an experiment in which we tested the
trained model on a shufﬂed test set containing randomly or-
dered QA pairs. The top section of Table 4 shows the re-
sults on the original test set (ordered), with the results on the
shufﬂed test set below. We observe a difference of ∼1.87
for R@k averaged across k and models, and ∼0.33 for the
mean rank averaged across models, indicating that the order
of the QA pairs indeed matters.

Qualitative Examples. Figure 7 shows two examples using
the setup Q+DH+V. The ﬁrst column in the answer table of
each example is the answer probability. The ground truth
answer is highlighted in red.

7. Conclusion

We introduce a new AI task: Audio Visual Scene-Aware
Dialog, where the goal is to hold a dialog by answering
a user’s questions about dynamic scenes using natural lan-
guage. We collected the Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog
(AVSD) Dataset, using a two-person chat protocol on more
than 11,000 videos of human actions. We also developed
a model and performed many ablation studies, highlighting
the quality and complexity of the data. Our results show
that the dataset is rich, with all of the different modalities of
the data playing a role in tackling this task. We believe our
dataset can serve as a useful benchmark for evaluating and
promoting progress in audiovisual intelligent agents.
