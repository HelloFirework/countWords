Abstract

RGB images differentiate from depth as they carry more
details about the color and texture information, which can
be utilized as a vital complement to depth for boosting the
performance of 3D semantic scene completion (SSC). SSC
is composed of 3D shape completion (SC) and semantic
scene labeling while most of the existing approaches use
depth as the sole input which causes the performance bot-
tleneck. Moreover, the state-of-the-art methods employ 3D
CNNs which have cumbersome networks and tremendous
parameters. We introduce a light-weight Dimensional De-
composition Residual network (DDR) for 3D dense predic-
tion tasks. The novel factorized convolution layer is ef-
fective for reducing the network parameters, and the pro-
posed multi-scale fusion mechanism for depth and color im-
age can improve the completion and segmentation accuracy
simultaneously. Our method demonstrates excellent per-
formance on two public datasets. Compared with the lat-
est method SSCNet, we achieve 5.9% gains in SC-IoU and
5.7% gains in SSC-IOU, albeit with only 21% network pa-
rameters and 16.6% FLOPs employed compared with that
of SSCNet.

1. Introduction

We live in a 3D world where everything occupies part of
the physical space under the view of the human perception
system. Similarly, 3D scene understanding is of importance
since it is a reﬂection about the real-world scenario. As one
of the most vital ﬁelds in 3D scene understanding, Semantic
Scene Completion (SSC) has verity of applications, includ-
ing robotic navigation [13], scene reconstruction [14], auto-
driving [22] etc. However, due to the dimensional curse
brought by 3D representation [40] and the limited annota-
tion datasets, the research ﬁeld of SSC still step slowly in
the past decades.

∗ First two authors contributed equally.

With the renaissance of deep learning [21, 9, 41] and a
few large-scale datasets being made available [25, 5, 36] in
recent years. The research activities of 3D shape processing
thrive again in the computer vision community, injecting
new possibilities and objectives for SSC as well introducing
some unprecedented challenges.

Conventional methods usually utilize the hand-crafted
features, such as voxel [19] and TSDF [18] to represent
the 3D object shape, and make use of the graph model to
infer the scene occupations and semantic labeling individ-
ually [12, 19]. The current state-of-the-art technique SSC-
Net [36], instead uses an end-to-end 3D network to conduct
the scene completion and category labeling simultaneously.
Through combining the semantic and geometrical informa-
tion implicitly via the network learning process, the two in-
dividual tasks can beneﬁt from each other.

Though remarkable gains in terms of scene comple-
tion and labeling accuracy have been achieved, the mas-
sive amount of parameters brought by the 3D representation
make it computing-intensive. Moreover, another problem
suffered in the existing SSC is the low-resolution represen-
tation [36, 11]. In particular, due to the limitation of compu-
tation resources, both of the conventional and deep learning
based methods sacriﬁce high-resolution to compromise an
acceptable speed.

On the other hand, most of existing methods solely use
depth as input, which is struggled to differentiate objects
from various categories. For example, a paper and a table-
cloth on the same table can be easily distinguished by color
or texture information. To sum up, depth and color image
are different modalities captured by the sensor, they all pro-
vide us with what the scene looks like. The former gives
us more sense about the object shape and distance, while
the later transfers more information about the object texture
and saliency. It is proved that both of the two modalities are
helpful to boost the performance of SSC task [7], although
how to fuse them is still an unsolved problem.

To overcome the problems as mentioned above, we pro-
pose a light-weight semantic scene completion network,

7693

which utilizes both of the depth and RGB information. It
formulates the 3D scene completion and labeling as a joint
task and learns in an end-to-end way. The main contribu-
tions of this paper are three-fold:

• Firstly, we propose the dimensional decomposition
residual (DDR) blocks for 3D convolution, which dra-
matically reduces the model parameters without per-
formance degradation.

• Secondly, 3D feature maps of RGB and depth are fused
in multi-scale seamlessly, which enhances the network
representation ability and boost the performance of SC
and SSC tasks.

• Thirdly,

the proposed end-to-end training network
achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYU [35]
and NYUCAD [6] datasets.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 brieﬂy summaries the related works, Section 3 intro-
duces the methodology. Section 4 presents the experimen-
tal results.Section 5 analyses different parts of the proposed
method. Section 6 summarizes our ﬁndings and concludes
with future research interests.

2. Related Works

2.1. 3D Scene Completion and Semantic Labeling

As an important branch in 3D scene understanding, se-
mantic scene completion (SSC) has many real-world appli-
cations and has received increasing attention recently with
the support of deep learning [21] and the large-scale anno-
tated dataset [36].

SSCNet [36] is the ﬁrst one which formulates the shape
completion and semantic labeling as a joint task and learns
the task in an end-to-end way. TS3D [7] is based on SSC-
Net, and utilizes an additional network to incorporate the
color information into the learning loop. Both of SSC-
Net and TS3D adopt truncated signed distance function
(TSDF [18]) to encode the 3D volume, where every voxel
stores the distance value d to its closest surface, and the
sign of the value indicates whether the voxel is in free space
or occluded. However, TSDF is computationally intensive
since it requires the calculation of the distance between the
points on the surface and each point belong to the objects.
Although with remarkable performance achieved, the 3D
convolution representation results in a network that is com-
putationally expensive with highly redundant parameters.

2.2. Computation efﬁcient Networks

As

a milestone

in deep learning architectures,
ResNet [16] uses a residual block to prevent
the per-
formance degradation that occurs when network layers
become deep. The extreme deep network leads to the
state-of-the-art performance in many tasks
including
image classiﬁcation [21], object detection [30, 29, 26] and

segmentation [3, 15]. However, this is very expensive con-
cerning computation resource and heavy-burden [16, 21].
To cater to the appeal for real-world applications, there
is a trend to tailor the heavy-burden networks to the
light-weight network in recent years.

Feature Representation Considering the redundant in-
formation contained in the 3D scene completion, the ﬁrst
spectrum of work try to model the scene with sparse feature
representation. Speciﬁcally, OctNet [31] and O-CNN [39]
utilize the Octree-based CNN to represent the 3D object
shape. PointNet [2] and Kd-Networks [20] employ point
clouds to indicate the occupation of the scene. Although
saving the memory and computation, the neighbor pixels
are usually mapped to the same voxel, which inevitably
causes the detail missing for semantic labeling and scene
understanding.

Group Convolution In recent two years, there are sev-
eral popular light-weight networks have been proposed, in-
clude MobileNet [17, 34] and ShufﬂeNet [43].
In Mo-
bileNet, depth-wise convolutions and point-wise convolu-
tions are utilized to separate the channels as well as reduce
the parameters and the calculations. In ShufﬂeNet, besides
the group point-wise convolution and depth-wise convolu-
tion are adopted, shufﬂe layer is developed for informa-
tion exchange between different shufﬂe units. However, the
above models heavily rely on depth-wise convolution and
group convolution, and mainly target at 2D networks thus
can not directly be applied for 3D tasks.

Spatial Group Convolution To improve the computing
efﬁciency of the 3D network. EsscNet [42] is introduced,
rather than to conduct the group convolution on feature
channel dimension, which adopts the group convolution on
the spatial aspect. The drawback of spatial group convolu-
tion is that it splits the features manually into separate parts,
which cause the performance drops. Meanwhile, the split-
ting process involves hash table maintaining and coordinate
with other blocks, and is cumbersome for transplantation.
On the contrary, the proposed DDR block is much ﬂexible,
and it can be planted to any network which contains the 3D
modules.

2.3. Modality Fusion in SSC

There are many works focused on RGBD fusion in 2D
applications [38, 27, 1, 28, 12]. RGBD sensor can capture
the depth and color images simultaneously, although depth
can be used to infer the geometry of the scene, which is
too sparse to reconstruct the occluded parts of the scene.
Compared with depth, color image carries more cues about
texture, color, and reﬂections, which can be viewed as an es-
sential complement to the depth for SSC task. Following the
design philosophy of SSCNet, TS3D [7] adds the color im-
age into the work-ﬂow. However, the scene labeling needs
to be estimated twice, and the depth ﬂow and color ﬂow are

still apart from each other from the essential.

In [10], two fusion strategies were proposed, one is
early-stage fusion which concatenates the feature at the ﬁrst
layer, and another is mid-level fusion which concatenates
the features before the output layer. Although follow the
overall design and reuse the features of SSCNet, the perfor-
mance of adopting both fusion strategies are unexpectedly
worse than that of SSCNet.

The most related work for feature fusion is RDFNet [27],
which utilizes multi-scale fused features from color images,
and aims to build a 2D segmentation framework. However,
fusing the features in the 3D network is much more chal-
lenging as mentioned before. In this paper, we propose a
novel fusion strategy which effectively fuses the 3D depth
and color features on multi-scales without bringing in extra
parameters.

3. Methodology

3.1. Overview

This section presents the proposed light-weight network
for SSC. The computation-efﬁcient Dimensional Decompo-
sition Residual (DDR) block, as well as a novel modality
fusion module, are emphasized. On the one hand, through
dimensional splitting on 3D convolutions and dense con-
nection, using DDR blocks can dramatically reduce the net-
work parameters. On the other hand, through fusing the
3D features of depth and color image seamlessly, the pro-
posed network can efﬁciently make use of the information
captured by the RGBD sensors, and various modulates of
inputs complement with each other thus boost the perfor-

mance of shape completion and scene labeling simultane-
ously. The framework of the proposed network is shown
in Figure 1. The network has two feature extractors, which
take a full resolution depth and the corresponding color im-
age as inputs, respectively. The network ﬁrst uses 2D DDR
blocks to learn the local textures and the geometry repre-
sentation. Then, the 2D feature maps are projected to 3D
space by a projection layer. A multi-level fusion strategy is
then applied to fuse the texture and geometry information.
After that, the network responses are then concatenated and
fed into the subsequent light-weight Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling (ASPP) module to aggregate information in multi-
ple scales. In the end, another three pointwise convolutional
layers are used to predict the ﬁnal voxel labels. The follow-
ing parts will explain the design details of each module.

3.2. Dimensional Decomposition Residual Blocks

3.2.1 Basic DDR

Residual layers [16] have the property of allowing convolu-
tional layers to approximate residual functions,

xt = F d (xt−1, {Wi}) + xt−1

(1)

where xt−1 and xt are the input and output.. The func-
tion F d (xt−1, {Wi}) represents the residual mapping to be
learned and d is the dilation rate within the block. This
residual formulation facilitates learning and alleviates the
degradation problem present in architectures that stack a
large number of layers [33].

Directly applying the original (2D) ResNet block into the
3D dense prediction task, the two corresponding 3D resid-
ual layers will be: the non-bottleneck design with two-layer

Figure 2. Residual blocks and the proposed DDR blocks.

3 × 3 × 3 convolutions as described in Figure 2(a), and the
three-layer bottleneck version as depicted in Figure 2(c).

However, both of the two structures will suffer the prob-
lem of high computational costs as the network parameters
grow in cubic. We propose to redesign the residual through
decomposing the 3D convolution into three consecutive lay-
ers along each dimension. The proposed basic DDR block
is shown in Figure 2(b) and its deeper bottleneck version is
shown in Figure 2(d). In this way, the network can reduce
parameters and capable of capturing 3D geometric informa-
tion according to the theory in [37].

Here we provide an episode to illustrate the effectiveness
of DDR block for reducing network parameters: Consid-
ering a 3D CNN with input channels cin, output channels
cout, and kernel size of kx × ky × kz. Without losing the
generality, we can assume kx = ky = kz = k. The original
block in 3D CNN is then be decomposed into three consec-
utive layers with ﬁlter size 1×1× k, 1× k ×1 and k ×1×1,
accordingly. The computational costs of the original block
and DDR block are proportional to cin ×cout ×k×k×k and
cin×cout×(k+k+k), respectively. The advantage of DDR
for reducing network parameters will be enlarged when k
become large, since 3k ≪ k3. As an example, the param-
eters of a typical 3D convolutional layer with a 3 × 3 × 3
kernel will drops to 1/3 after adopting DDR block.

3.2.2 Deeper DDR

Inspired by the bottleneck design [16], we further deliver a
deeper DDR block. In speciﬁc, for each residual function, a
1×1×1 layer is added at both the top and bottom of the Di-
mensional Decomposition convolutions. The 1×1×1 layers

are responsible for reducing and restoring the dimensions,
which make the three Dimensional Decomposition convo-
lutional layers form a bottleneck with smaller input/output
dimensions.

Moreover, parameter-free identity shortcuts are added
within each dimensional decomposition convolution. The
dense identity connections are not only helpful for robust
feature representation but also have the merits of alleviating
the vanishing-gradient problem and strengthen the feature
propagation [16]. In the remainder of the paper, DDR refers
to the deeper DDR block unless speciﬁcally noted.

3.3. Two Modality Multi level Feature Fusion

3.3.1 Feature Extractor Module

In our network, there are two parallel branches for feature
extraction corresponding to the depth and color image. As
shown in Figure 1(b), the feature extractor module is com-
posed of three components: a 2D feature extractor, a 3D
feature extractor and a projection layer which mapping the
2D feature to the 3D feature. The network ﬁrst utilizes 2D
feature extractor to learn local color and texture representa-
tion. After feature mapping to the 3D space by a projection
layer, 3D feature extractor is employed to acquire the ge-
ometry and context information.

2D Feature Extractor To extract features from a 2D
depth and color image, a 2D point-wise convolution is
ﬁrstly used to increase the channels of feature maps. Then
two 2D DDR blocks are stacked for residual learning.
Through the process, the resolution of the output feature
map keeps the same as the input image. Please note, in our
network, the number of parameters for 2D DDR blocks is
192, which is insigniﬁcant when compared with the 195k
parameters for 3D DDR blocks. Therefore, we mainly fo-
cus on the light-weight operations of 3D DDR blocks.

Projection Layer Since each pixel in the depth map cor-
responding to a tensor in the 2D feature map, every fea-
ture tensor can be projected into the 3D volume at the lo-
cation with the same depth value. This step yields an in-
complete 3D volume that assigns to every surface voxel its
corresponding feature tensor. For the voxels that are not
occupied by any depth values, their feature vectors are set
to zeros. The mapping index Tu,v at (u, v) can be com-
puted using the depth value Iu,v and camera pose C which
are provided along with each image. Because the feature
volume resolution is lower than the feature map resolution,
several neighboring features will be projected into the same
voxel, and we use max-pooling to simulate this step. With
the feature projection layer, the 2D feature maps extracted
by the 2D CNN are converted to a view-independent 3D
feature volume. During training, the mapping indexes T
between feature map tensors and voxels are recorded in a
table for gradient back-propagation.

a view-independent 3D feature volume is acquired. In this
step, we further extract features using two 3D DDR blocks.
A down-sample block is added in front of each DDR blocks
to reduce the size of the feature maps and increase the di-
mension of its channel. Figure 1(c) shows the structure of
the down-sample block. A pooling layer and a pointwise
convolution layer are concatenated to increase the channels
of the output feature map of the down-sample block.

3.3.2 Multi-level Feature Fusion

One primary challenge of 3D RGBD based semantic seg-
mentation is how to effectively extract the color features
along with depth features and to utilize those features for
the labeling. To fully use the multi-modal features, we pro-
pose a novel feature fusion strategy which is inspired by
[24, 27]. We employ multi-modal CNN feature fusion while
preserving the lower computational cost. In speciﬁc, differ-
ent levels of features are extracted through multiple DDR
modules, and then these features are merged together by
element-wise add. The reason for using element-wise add
rather than other operations is because it can fuse the fea-
tures neatly with insigniﬁcant computation costs.

Through the cascaded DDR blocks, both low-level fea-
tures and high-level features are captured, which enhance
the representation ability of the network and is beneﬁcial
for the performance of semantic scene completion task.

3.4. Light weight ASPP Module

Different object categories have various physical 3D
sizes in indoor scenes. This requires the network to capture
information at different scales in order to recognize the ob-
jects reliably. Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) [3, 4]
exploits multi-scale features by employing multiple parallel
ﬁlters with different dilatation rates and has been proved to
be powerful to improve the CNN’s ability to handle objects
with various sizes. However, directly applying ASPP in 3D
semantic scene completion would bring in tremendous pa-
rameters as well as large computations.

Based on this consideration, we introduce a light-weight
ASPP (LW-ASPP) which is capable of handling scale vari-
ability while requiring fewer computations.
In speciﬁc,
LW-ASPP uses multiple parallel DDR blocks with different
sampling (dilation) rates. The dilated DDR is implemented
by setting a dilation rate in the three-dimensional decompo-
sition convolutions within the DDR block. The dilated DDR

explicitly adjusts the ﬁeld-of-view of ﬁlters as well as con-
trols the resolution of the feature responses. The features
extracted from different sampling rates are further concate-
nated and fused to generate the ﬁnal result with the output
layer, which is constructed by the three 3D point-wise con-
volution layers as shown in Figure 1.

3.5. Training and Loss

Training Given the training dataset (i.e. the RGBD images
and ground truth volumetric object labels of 3D scenes), our
method can be trained end-to-end. SSCNet [36] sets a small
value (0.05) as the weight of the voxels in free space for
data balancing in the training process. We adopt the same
strategy in our early training process. With each additional
50 training epochs, the weight of empty voxels is gradually
doubled until it is set to be the same as the other occupied
voxels. All the experiments are conducted using the py-
Torch framework on GPU. Our model is trained using the
SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of
10−4 and batch size is 2, the initial learning rate is 0.01 and
divided by a factor of 10 when the training loss changes less
than 1e-4 within 5 consecutive epochs.

Loss For training the network, we employ the softmax
cross entropy loss on the unnormalized network outputs y:

L = −

N

Xc=1

c′ eyic′!
wc ˆyi,c log  eyic
PN

(2)

where ˆyi,c are the binary ground truth vectors, i.e. ˆyi,c = 1
if voxel i is labeled by class c, N is the number of classes,
and wc is the loss weight. To compute the loss function, we
remove all voxels outside the ﬁeld of view and the room and
include all non-empty voxels plus occluded voxels.

4. Experiments

In this section, we evaluate and compare the proposed
method with the state-of-the-art approaches on two public
datasets, i.e. NYU [35] and NYUCAD [6]. Both the quanti-
tative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of
our algorithm on SSC task.

a Kinect sensor. Following SSCNet [36], we use the 3D
annotated labels provided by [32] for semantic scene com-
pletion task. NYUCAD [6] uses the depth maps generated
from the projections of the 3D annotations to reduce the
misalignment of depths and the annotations. We compare
our method with the state-of-the-art methods on both NYU
and NYUCAD datasets.
Metrics As the evaluation metric, the voxel-level intersec-
tion over union (IoU) between the predicted voxel label and
ground truth label is used. For the task of semantic scene
completion, we evaluate the IoU of each object classes on
both the observed and occluded voxels. For the task of
scene completion, we treat all non-empty object class as one
category and evaluate IoU of the binary predictions on the
occluded voxels.

4.2. Comparisons with the State of the art Methods

Table 1 shows the results on NYU dataset acquired by
our method and the state-of-the-art methods. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance regarding different metrics.
Speciﬁcally, we achieve the best performance for both the
tasks of scene completion and semantic scene completion
and also rank the second best of recall and precision for
scene completion. We outperform the previous SSCNet by
a signiﬁcant margin in overall performance, that are 5.7%
gains in semantic scene completion and 5.9% gains in scene
completion. The proposed network demonstrate the supe-
rior performance in some categories such as ceil., table, tvs,
furn. etc. We inspect this improvement due to the novel ar-
chitecture, that makes use of the robust features from multi-
level and multi-modalities, and data fusion, which effec-
tively complement the details from the color image to these
textureless objects.

To validate the robustness and generalization of the pro-
posed network, we also conduct experiments on NYUCAD
dataset as shown in Table 2. The comparison results with
the state-of-the-art methods present the same trend. Among
all of the methods, we achieve the best performance for se-
mantic scene completion and scene completion.

4.3. Quantitative Analysis

Since we target at a light-weight 3D network for seman-
tic scene completion, in this section, we list the params
and FLOPs of the proposed method as well as the base-
line method. As shown in Table 4. In speciﬁc, compared
with the state-of-the-art method SSCNet, the parameters in
our method is 21.0% of that in SSCNet, and the FLOPs is
16.6% of that SSCNet. However, the performance of both
scene completion and semantic scene completion is around
6% higher than that of SSCNet. Compared with the Essc-
Net [42], depth solely is used as the input for a fair compar-
ison, our method is computationally cheaper than EsscNet
with 6% reduction in FLOPS and increased performance.
For SC and SSC tasks, EsscNet reaches the accuracies of
56.2% (SC) and 26.7% (SSC), and we achieve 59.0% (SC)
and 28.9% (SSC).

4.4. Qualitative Analysis

Figure 3.4 shows visualized results (in different scenar-
ios) of the scene segmentation generated by the proposed
method (c) and SSCNet (d), ground truth (b) are also pro-
vided as a reference. All the results are acquired on the
NYUCAD validation set. As can be seen, compared with
SSCNet, the scene completion results of our method is
much more abundant in detail and less error-prone.

It can be easily seen that our method performs better for
objects such as furn, wall, and ﬂoor. For example, in the
second and third rows, SSC will cause some missing in the
details of the wall, which is rarely happening in our algo-
rithm. Part of the reason that our method is better for han-
dling the texture-less and small objects we attribute which
come from the incorporated color features. In row(1), our

method effectively captures the detail information about the
leg of the chair. In addition, compared with SSCNet, the
proposed method maintains the segmentation consistency
for objects with big sizes, such as the wall and ﬂoor in
the row(2) and ceiling in the row(4). And row(3) shows
a much challenging instance, i.e. the window, both SSCNet
and our method cannot acquire satisﬁed results. However,
our method can recognize part of the information. Row(5)
and row(6) show the failure cases in our methods, specif-
ically, in the row(5), the fresco on the wall has the simi-
lar texture with the stuff on the bookshelf, it thus wrongly
classiﬁed into the category of the bookshelf. In row(6), the
ground-truth furniture circled by the red dashed rectangle,
SSCNet wrongly predicts it into the object category, and our
network wrongly classiﬁes it as a chair, which may due to
the quite similar shape and color information between the
furniture and the chair category. In supplementary materi-
als, more visualized results are provided.

5. Ablation Study

RGB and Depth Fusion Both RGB and Depth information
are important for 3D scene understanding. To verify the ef-
fectiveness of the proposed multi-level fusion strategy, we
evaluate the performance of our method with only depth or
RGB image as the input. As can be seen in Table 3, and the
performance on SSC of our method for only using depth
or color image as input are 28.9% and 27.2%, respectively.
Since RGB images carry more details such as color and
texture, which is beneﬁcial for the semantic information,
this can be seen from the results of category tvs and cate-
gory sofa. However, the advantage of using depth lies on
it carries more geometry information, for the objects which
are difﬁcult to differentiate through color information, it is
much easier to tell the difference according to their shapes.
Such as table and ﬂoor. Moreover, depth is less sensitive
regarding illumination changes and the dramatic color vari-
ation within the same category, which may explain for the
indoor scene, the result of using depth is a bit better than
that of using a color image as input.

Meanwhile, merging depth and color features in our
method signiﬁcantly improve the SSC performance, which
proves the two-modality information can be an excellent
complement to each other. And beneﬁt from the light-
weight DDR block applied in the network, the overall com-
putations and parameters remain small.
Light-weight ASPP The effectiveness of ASPP has been
veriﬁed in 2D semantic segmentation [3] task. However,
the direct expansion of ASPP from 2D to 3D would bring

in a massive amount of parameters as well as make the net-
work cumbersome. Lightweight ASPP (LW-ASPP) using
DDR block as the primary core, which not only effectively
reduces the network parameters but also inherits the mer-
its of ASPP for capturing multi-scale information, thus is
beneﬁcial to the 3D task.

In order to verify the validity of LW-ASPP, we design
a group of experiments in which LW-ASPP was removed
from the network or replaced with 3D ASSP directly ex-
tended from ASPP. As can be seen in Table 5, when com-
pared with the network without ASPP module, adding LW-
ASPP boosts the SC-IoU 3.2% and SSC-IoU 3.6%. When
replacing LW-ASPP with 3D-ASPP, the performance can be
further improved by a small margin but with the sacriﬁce of
over two times params and around three times FLOPs.
Change of speed/memory and performance As shown in
Table 6, DDRNet with quite a few parameters and FLOPs
compared to SSCNet. DDRNet has a deeper structure,
thus stronger non-linear representation ability than the 3D-
ResNet version, albeit less memory cost required. More-
over, DDRNet achieves much faster speed with an insignif-
icant performance loss.

6. Conclusion

This paper proposes a novel structure for handling the
semantic scene completion problem. Speciﬁcally, an end-
to-end light-weight Dimensional Decomposition Residual
(DDR) network is delivered for scene completion and se-
mantic scene labeling.
The two contributions are the
proposed factorized convolution layer and a novel two-
modality fusion mechanism. The former is effective to re-
duce the parameters within the network, and the later can
fuse the depth and color image seamlessly in multi-level,
the state-of-the-art results are achieved for both SSC and
SC task on two public datasets. In the future, considering
to differentiate instances of the indoor scene as well as to
incorporate the shufﬂe layer into the proposed light-weight
network will be our research interests.
