Abstract

Recent successes of deep learning-based recognition
rely on maintaining the content related to the main-task
label. However, how to explicitly dispel the noisy sig-
nals for better generalization remains an open issue. We
systematically summarize the detrimental factors as task-
relevant/irrelevant semantic variations and unspeciÔ¨Åed la-
tent variation. In this paper, we cast these problems as an
adversarial minimax game in the latent space. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
we propose equipping an end-to-end conditional adversar-
ial network with the ability to decompose an input sample
into three complementary parts. The discriminative repre-
sentation inherits the desired invariance property guided by
prior knowledge of the task, which is marginally indepen-
dent to the task-relevant/irrelevant semantic and latent vari-
ations. Our proposed framework achieves top performance
on a serials of tasks, including digits recognition, lighting,
makeup, disguise-tolerant face recognition, and facial at-
tributes recognition.

tion x, which associated with the discriminative representation d

Our framework explicitly enforces them marginally independent
to each other. The d and task-dependent s are related to the main-
recognition task label y.

1. Introduction

Extracting a discriminative representation for the task at
hand is an important research goal of recognition. We tar-
geting for the problem of explicitly eliminating the detri-
mental variations following the prior knowledge of our task
to achieve better generalization. It is challenging since the
training set contains images annotated with multiple seman-
tic variations of interest, but there is no example of the trans-
formation (e.g., gender) as the unsupervised image transla-
tion [33, 6], and the latent variation is totally unspeciÔ¨Åed.

Following the terminology used in previous multi-class
dataset (including a main-task label and several side-labels)
[20, 46, 44], we propose to deÔ¨Åne three complementary

parts as in Fig 1.

The factors relate to the side-labels is named as the
semantic variations (s), which can be either task ‚àí
relevant/irrelevant depending on whether
they are
marginally independent to the main recognition task or not
[59]. The latent variation (l) summarizes the remain-
ing properties unspeciÔ¨Åed by main and semantic labels.
How the DNN can systematically learn a discriminative
representation (d) to be informative for the main recogni-
tion task, while marginally independent to both multiple s
and unspeciÔ¨Åed l remains challenging.

Several efforts have been made to enforce the main task
representation invariant to a single task-irrelevant (in-
dependent) semantic factor, such as pose, expression or

cessing [19, 56] or metric learning [35]. These methods
bear the same drawback that the cost used to regularize the
representation is pairwise, which does not scale well as the
number of values that the attribute can take could be large.
Since the invariance we care about can vary greatly across
tasks, these approaches require us to design a new architec-
ture each time when a new invariance is required.

Moreover, a basic assumption in their theoretical analy-
sis is that the attribute is irrelevant to the prediction, which
limits its capabilities in analyzing the task-relevant (de-
pendent) semantic labels [5, 59]. These labels are usually
used to achieve the attribute-enhanced recognition via the
feature aggregation in multi-task learning [16, 22, 49, 32]
(e.g., gender, age and ethnicity can shrink the search space
for face identiÔ¨Åcation).

However, the invariance w.r.t.

those attributes are also
desired in some speciÔ¨Åc tasks. For example, the makeup
face recognition system should be invariant to age, hair
color etc. Similarly, the gender and ethnicity are sensitive
factors in fairness/bias-free classiÔ¨Åcation when predicting
the credit and health condition of a person. These seman-
tic labels and the main task label are related due to the in-
herent bias within the data. A possible solution is setting
this attribute as a random variable of a probabilistic model
and reasoning about the invariance explicitly [39, 9, 61].
Since the divergence between a pair of distributions is used
as the criteria to induce the invariance, the number of pairs
to be processed grows quadratically with the number of at-
tributes, which can be computationally expensive for the
multiple variations in practice.

Another challenge is how to achieve better generaliza-
tion by dispelling those latent variations without the label.
For instance, we may expect our face recognition system
not only be invariant to the expression following the side
label, but also applicable to different race, which do not has
side label. We note this problem also share some similar-
ity with feature disentanglements in image generation area
[44, 14], while our goal is to improve content classiÔ¨Åcation
performance instead of synthesizing high-quality images.

Motivated by the aforementioned difÔ¨Åculties, we pro-
pose to enable a system which can dispel a group of unde-
sired task-irrelevant/relevant and latent variations in an un-
supervised manner: we do not need paired semantic trans-
formation example [33, 6] and latent labels.

SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we resort to an end-to-end conditional ad-
versarial training framework. Our approach relies on an
encoder-decoder architecture where, given an input image
x with its main-task label y and to-be dispelled semantic
variation label s, the encoders maps x to a discriminative
representation d and a latent variation l, and the decoder is
trained to reconstruct x given (d,s,l). We conÔ¨Ågure a se-
mantic discriminator condition to s only, and two classiÔ¨Åers

with inverse objectives which condition to d and l, respec-
tively to constrain the latent space for manipulating multiple
variations for better scalability.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as:
‚Ä¢ It is able to explicitly learn a task-speciÔ¨Åc discriminative
representation with desired invariance property by system-
atically incorporating prior domain knowledge of the task.
The to-be dispelled multiple semantic variations could be
either task-dependent or task-independent semantic vari-
ations, and the unspeciÔ¨Åed latent variation can also been
eliminated in an unsupervised manner.
‚Ä¢ Semantic discriminator and two inverse classiÔ¨Åers are in-
troduced to constrain the latent space and result in a simpler
training pipeline and better scalability.
‚Ä¢ The semantic and latent variation representations are
jointly disentangled and preserved as the complementary
parts. The Ô¨Çexible swapping of those factors makes dif-
ferent image transform with a uniÔ¨Åed model.

Experimental results on source-independent digits clas-
siÔ¨Åcation, lighting-tolerant (Extrended YaleB) face recogni-
tion, makeup-invariant face recognition and disguised face
recognition benchmarks show that the proposed model out-
performs existing discriminative approaches. We further
show that our framework is generic enough to accommodate
hand-written style transforms by switching the disentangled
latent or semantic codes.

2. Related work

Multi-task learning is a typical method to utilize multi-
class label. It has been observed in many prior works that
jointly learning of main-task and relevant side tasks can
help improve the performance in an aggregation manner
[16, 22, 49, 32], while we are targeting for dispelling.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has aroused
increasing attraction. Conventionally, under the two-player
(i.e., generator and discriminator) formulation, the vanilla
GANs [11] are good at generating realistic images, but
their potential for recognition remains to be developed.
The typical method use GANs as a preprocessing step of
image, which is similar to the ‚Äúdenoise‚Äù, and then use
these processed images for normal training and testing
[56, 19, 47, 54, 60, 36, 41]. We deploy the trained network
for predictions directly as a feature extractor.

Comparing with the pixel-level GANs [56, 19, 47, 54,
60, 36, 41], our feature-level competition results in much
simpler training schemes and nicely scales to multiple at-
tributes. Moreover, they usually cannot dispel task-relevant
s, e.g., dispel gender from identity cannot get verisimilar
face image for subsequent network training.

Besides, they usually focus on a single variation for a
speciÔ¨Åc task. Actually, the most of GANs and adversarial
domain adaptation [57, 4, 31] use binary adversarial objec-
tive and applied for no more than two distributions.

638

It is worth noting that some works of GANs, e.g., Semi-
Supervised GAN [24] and DR-GAN [56] have claimed that
they consider multiple side labels. Indeed, they have added
a new branch for the multi-categorical classiÔ¨Åcation, but
their competing adversarial loss only confuses the discrim-
inator by using two distributions (real or generated) and no
adversarial strategies are adopted between different cate-
gories in the auxiliary multi-categorical classiÔ¨Åer branch.

We are different from them in two aspects: 1) the
input of semantic discriminator is feature,
instead of
real/synthesized image; 2) the goal of encoder needs to
match or align the feature distribution between any two dif-
ferent attributes, instead of only real/fake distribution, and
there is no ‚Äúreal‚Äù class in semantic discriminator.
Fairness/bias-free classiÔ¨Åcation also targets a representa-
tion that is invariant to certain task-relevant(dependent) fac-
tor (i.e., bias) hence makes the predictions fair [7]. As data-
driven models trained using historical data easily inherit the
bias exhibited in the data, the Fair VAEs [39] tackled the
problem using a Variational Autoencoder structure [25] ap-
proached with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) regu-
larization [30]. [62] proposed to regularize the l1 distance
between representation distributions of data with different
nuisance variables to enforce fairness. These methods have
the same drawback that the cost used to regularize the rep-
resentation is pairwise, which does not scale well for mul-
tiple semantic variations [59, 5]. [59] propose to combine
this concept with adversarial training, which has the similar
framework as the Fader Networks [27] for image genera-
tion.
Latent variation disentangled representation is closely
related to our work. It trying to separate the input into two
complementary codes according to their correlation with
the task for image transform in single label dataset setting
[3]. Early attempts [52] separate text from fonts using bi-
linear models. Manifold learning and VAEs were used in
[8, 24] to separate the digit from the style. What-where en-
coders [64] combined the reconstruction criteria with dis-
crimination to separate the factors that are relevant to the
labels. Unfortunately, their approaches cannot be general-
ized to unseen identities. [44, 58] added the GANs objec-
tive into the VAEs objective to relax this restriction using
an intricate triplet training pipeline. [18, 37, 14, 2, 21, 21]
further reduced the complexity. Inspired by them, we make
our framework implicitly invariant to unspeciÔ¨Åed l for bet-
ter generality in a simple yet efÔ¨Åcient way. [44].

3. Methodology

3.1. The problem deÔ¨Ånition

We formalize the task of Feature-level Frankenstein
(FLF)
framework as follows: Given a training set
D = (cid:8)x1, s1, y1(cid:9) , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , (cid:8)xM , sM , yM (cid:9), of M samples

{image, semantic variations, class}, we are interested
in the task of disentangling the feature representation of x to
be three complementary parts, i.e., discriminative represen-
tation d, semantic variation s and latent variation l. These
three codes are expected to be marginally independent with
each other, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.
In the
case of face, typical semantic variations including gender,
expressions etc. All the remaining variability unspeciÔ¨Åed
by y and s fall into the latent part l. We note that there are
two possible dependency scenarios of s and y as discussed
in Sec. 1. This will not affect the deÔ¨Ånition of l, and the
information related to y should incorporate d and some of
the task-dependent s.

3.2. The structure of representations

For the latent variation encoding, we choose the l to be a
vector of real value rather than a one-hot or a class ordinal
vector to enable the network to be generalized to identities
that are not presented in the training dataset as in [44, 2].
However, as the semantic variations are human-named for
a speciÔ¨Åc domain, this concern is removed. In theory, s can
be any type of data (e.g., continuous value scalar/vector,
or a sub-structure of a natural language sentence) as long
as it represents a semantic attribute of x under our frame-
work. For simplicity, we consider here the case where s is
a N-dimensional binary variable for N to-be controlled se-
mantic variations. Regarding the multi-categorical labels,
they are factorized to multiple binary choices. The domain
adaptation could be a special case of our model when the
semantic variation is the Bernoulli variable which takes the
one-dimensional binary value (i.e., s = {0, 1}), represent-
ing the domains.

3.3. Framework architecture

The model described in Fig. 2 is proposed to achieve
our objective based on an encoder-decoder architecture with
conditional adversarial training.

At inference time, a test image is encoded to the d and
l in the latent space, and the d can be used for recognition
task with desired invariant property w.r.t. the s. Besides,
the user can choose the combination of (d,s,l) that are fed
to the decoder for different image transforms.

Informative to main-recognition task. The discriminative
encoder Ed with parameter Œ∏Ed maps an input image to its
discriminative representation d = Ed(x) which is informa-
tive for the main recognition task and invariant to some se-
mantic attributes. By invariance, we mean that given two
samples x1, x2 from a subject class (y1 = y2) but with
different semantic attribute labels (s1 6= s2), their d1 and
d2 are expected to be the same. Given the obtained d, we
expect to predict its corresponding label y with the classi-
Ô¨Åer Cd to model the distribution pCd (y|x). The task of Cd

where we use the categorical cross-entropy loss for the clas-
siÔ¨Åer. The q(x, s, y) is the true underlying distribution that
the empirical observations are drawn from.

Eliminating semantic variations. The discriminator Dis
output probabilities of an attribute vector pDis(s|d).
In
practical implementation, this is made by concatenating d
and binary attributes code s for input and outputs the [0,1]
values using the sigmoid unit. Its loss depends on the cur-
rent state of semantic encoders and is written as:

min
Dis

max
Ed

LDis = E

x,s‚àºq(x,s,y)-logpDis(s|Ed(x))

(2)

Concretely, the Dis and Ed form an adversarial game,
in which the Dis is trained to detect an attribute of
data by maximizing the likelihood pDis(s|d), while the
Ed Ô¨Åghts to conceal
it by minimizing the same like-
lihood.
Eq.(2) guarantees that d is marginally inde-
pendent to s. Supposing that a semantic variation fol-
lows the Bernoulli distribution, the loss is formulated as
‚àí {slogDis(d) + (1 ‚àí s)log(1 ‚àí Dis(d))}. The pro-
posed framework is readily amenable to control multiple
attributes by extending the dimension of semantic variation
vector. With N to-be dispelled semantic variations, we have
logpDis(s|d) = PN
i=1 {logpDis(si|d)}. Note that even
with binary attribute values at the training stage, each at-
tribute can be considered as a continuous variable during
inference to choose how much a speciÔ¨Åc attribute is per-
ceivable in the generated images.

As discussed in Sec. 2, our semantic discriminator is
essentially different from conventional GANs. The feature-
level competition also similar to adversarial auto-encoder

[43], which match the intermediate feature with a prior dis-
tribution (Gaussian). However, we are conditioned to an-
other vector s, and require the encoder align the distribution
between any two s, instead of only real/fake.

Eliminating latent variation. To train the latent variation
encoder El, we propose a novel variant of adversarial net-
works, in which the El plays a minimax game with a classi-
Ô¨Åer Cl instead of a discriminator. The Cl inspects the back-
ground latent variation l and learns to predict class label
correctly, while the El is trying to eliminate task-speciÔ¨Åc
factors d by fooling Cl to make false predictions.

Since the ground truth of d is unobservable, we use the y
in here, which incorporate d and main-task relevant s. We
also use softmax ouput unit and cross-entropy loss in our
implementations. In contrast to using three parallel VAEs
[44], the adversarial classiÔ¨Åers are expected to alleviate the
costly training pipeline and facilitate the convergence.

Complementary constraint. The decoder Dec is a decon-
volution network to produce a new version of the input im-
age given the concatenated codes (d, s, l). These three parts
should contain enough information to allow the reconstruc-
tion of the input x. Herein, we measure the similarity of the
reconstruction with the self-regularized mean squared error
(MSE) for simply:

Lrec = E

This design contributes to variation separation in an im-
plicit way, and makes the encoded features more inclusive
of the image content.

Independent analysis

The three complementary parts are expected to uncorre-
lated to each other. The s is marginally independent to the
d and s, since its short code cannot incorporate the other
information. We learn the d to be discriminative to the
main recognition task and marginally independent to s by
maximizing the certainty of making main task predictions
(Eqn. (1)) and uncertainty of inferring the semantic varia-
tions given the d (Eqn. (2)). Given the l, minimizing the
certainty of making main task (y) predictions in Eqn. (3)
can makes l marginally independent to the d and some of
the task-dependent s.

Considering the complexity of our framework, we do not
strictly require our learned l to be marginally independent
to task-irrelevant s. The ground truth label of l also does
not exist in the datasets to supervise the d to be marginally
independent to latent variation l. Instead, we limit the out-
put dimension of Ed and El as an information bottleneck
to implicitly require d and l incorporate little unexpected
information [55]. Additionally, a reconstruction loss is uti-
lized as the complementary constraint, which avoids the d
and l containing nothing.

4. Experiments

To illustrate

the behavior of

the Feature-level
Frankenstein (FLF) framework, we quantitatively evaluate
the discriminative representation with desired invariance
property on three different recognition tasks and also
offer qualitative evaluations by visually examining the
perceptual quality of conditional face generation. As the
frequent metrics (e.g., log-likelihood of a set of validation
samples) are not meaningful for perceptual generative
models [53], we measure the information associated with
the semantic variations s or main-task label y that
is
contained in each representation part to evaluate the degree
of disentanglement as in [44, 39].

Several trade-off parameters constrained between 0 and
1 are used to balance the judiciously selected loss functions.

method is comparable to (b) [44] with triplet-training, using more

The El is trained to minimize the (‚àíLCl + ŒªLrec), where
the Œª is used to weight the relevance of the latent represen-
tation with the class label, and the quality of reconstruction.
In all our experiments, we utilize the Adam optimization
method [23] with a learning rate of 0.001 and beta of 0.9 for
the training of the encoders-decoder network, discriminator
and classiÔ¨Åers. We use a variable weight for the discrimina-
tor loss coefÔ¨Åcient Œ±. We initially set Œ± to 0 and the model
is trained as a normal auto-encoder. Then, Œ± is linearly
increased to 0.5 over the Ô¨Årst 500,000 iterations to slowly
encourage the model to produce invariant representations.
This scheduling turned out to be critical in our experiments.
Without it, we observed that the Ed was too affected by the
loss coming from the discriminator, even for low values of
Œ±. All the models were implemented using TensorFlow.

4.1. Source independent digits classiÔ¨Åcation

We construct a combined dataset DIGITS with the
MNIST [28] and SVHN [45] to verify the ability of FLF for
digit classiÔ¨Åcation with the prior information about back-
ground variation. The MNIST is a digit dataset, in which
each sample is a 28 √ó 28 black and white digit image with
the class label from 0 to 9. Street View House Numbers

The original images (b) are clustered according to their lighting
environments, while the discriminative representation learned by
our framework (a) is more likely to cluster with only identities.

(SVHN) is a collection of house numbers collected from
Google street view images, and each is a colored image with
a size of 32 √ó 32, containing printing type digits in the nat-
ural environment. We resize SVHN images to 28 √ó 28 and
replicate the MNIST samples to three channels to combine
these two training sets. As we know, the background be-
tween these two datasets has large contrast, and should be
disentangled for our digits classiÔ¨Åcation task. Herein, we
construct a binary variable s which takes the value of 0 if
the sample is from MNIST with the clean background and
a value of 1, otherwise.

We show the average accuracy of digits recognition
when trained on DIGITS dataset and tested on MNIST and
SVHN in Fig. 4. We adopt the encoder and classiÔ¨Åer struc-
ture in [44] for the Ed and Cd in FLF and our baseline CNN
model which does not aim for an invariant feature is used
for comparison. As desired, our source-invariant represen-
tation is better at classifying digits in both sub-tasks than
the baseline. The two heads multi-task network that pre-
dicts digits number and source sharing the parameters also
achieves the similar result as the baseline. It is not efÔ¨Åcient
to utilize the task-independent semantic labels. Moreover,
the 10-class & 10-class two-heads network require semantic
labels in testing stage to choose which head should be used
for a speciÔ¨Åc input. The precise semantic labels are hard
to acquire in real-world applications. These networks also
suffer from the same drawback that the network design will
be very complicated for multiple to-be disentangle semantic
variations.

In order to quantitatively measure the disentanglement,
we try to measure the amount of information related to
digit-classes y and the semantic variations s from the ex-
tracted representation d and l following the [44, 39]. Herein,
we report the testing results in MNIST dataset for compar-
ison in Table 1. As we can see, the latent variation rep-
resentations l are almost agnostic to the class label y and
semantic variation label s, while the discriminative repre-

sentations d archive high recognition accuracy to predict y
and incorporate few semantic variations s. We note that the
FLF is trained in DIGITS, while [44] cannot support seman-
tic variation disentanglement and is trained only in MNIST.
The higher accuracy of (y | d) than [44] is expected, since
the extra information transferred from SVHN with the prior
knowledge of background variance.

By Ô¨Åxing s = 0 (i.e., MNIST dataset) and swapping
the other two parts (i.e., d and l), we get the same func-
tion as in [44], which corresponds to solving image analo-
gies. Herein, the l component represents the hand-writing
style and d focuses on the class of digits. In Fig. 3. we
present our results of swapping and compare it with ex-
isting state-of-art methods. The style l and content d look
well separated and the visual properties in SVHN do not ap-
pear in our generated samples. To the best of our judgment,
the three disentangled parts are almost independent to each
other. Despite we do not have a loss function to disentangle
l from d, and the labels for the latent variation are usually
unavailable in realistic scenarios, the limited output dimen-
sion of Ed achieves the separation in an efÔ¨Åcient way. With-
out the triplet-training protocol, our training is much faster
than [44]. On our NVIDIA K40 GPU, the loss typically
converges within 20 mins for DIGITS, while the triplet-
training [44] takes more than one hour for only MNIST to
get the results with comparable visual quality. This gap will
be more appealing when applied to a larger dataset. Note
that SVHN makes little contribution to our MNIST digit
generation considering the difference between hand writing
style and the uniÔ¨Åed print fonts of house numbers.

4.2. Lighting tolerant face recognition

For our lighting-tolerant classiÔ¨Åcation task, we use the
It comprises face images
Extended Yale B dataset [10].
from 38 subjects under 5 different lighting conditions, i.e.,
front, upper left, upper right, lower left, or lower right. We
aim to predict the subject identity y using d. The seman-
tic variable s to be purged here is the lighting condition,
while the latent variation l does not have practical meaning
in this dataset setting. We follow the two-layer Ed structure
and train/test split of [39, 30]. 190 samples are utilized for
training and all remaining 1,096 images are used for testing.
The numerical results of recognition using Ed and Cd are
shown in Table 1. We compare it with the state-of-the-art
methods that use MMD regularizations etc., to remove the
affects of lighting conditions [39, 30]. The advantage of our
framework about factoring out lighting conditions is shown
by the improved accuracy 90.1%, while the best baseline
achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Although the lighting con-
ditions can be modeled very well with a Lambertian model,
we choose to use a generic neural network to learn invariant
features, so that the proposed method can be readily applied
to other applications.

Table 2. ClassiÔ¨Åcation accuracy comparisons. We expect the ac-
curacy of classifying y or s from l to be a lower value. A better
discriminative representation d has a higher accuracy of classify-
ing y and a lower accuracy in predicting s. *Following the setting
in [39], we utilize the Logistics Regression classiÔ¨Åer for the ac-
curacy of predicting the s and using original x to predict y. The
to be dispelled s represents source dataset (i.e., domain) on DIG-
ITS, and represents lighting condition on Extened YaleB, both are
main-task irrelevant semantic variations.

In terms of removing s, our framework can Ô¨Ålter the
lighting conditions since the accuracy of classifying s from
d drops from 56.5% to 26.2% (halved), as shown in Table
1. We note that 20% is a chance performance for 5 class
illumination, when the s is totally dispelled. This can also
be seen in the visualization of two-dimensional embeddings
of the original x Fig. 5 (b) and the discriminative repre-
sentations d extracted by FLF (a). We see that the original
images are clustered based on the lighting conditions. The
clustering based on CNN features are almost well according
to the identity, but still affected by the lighting and results in
a ‚Äòblack center‚Äô. As soon as we remove the lighting varia-
tions via FLF, images are distributed almost only according
to the identity of each subject.

4.3. Attributes invariant face recognition

Makeup face recognition

We evaluate the desired makeup-invariance property of
our learned discriminative representation on three makeup
benchmarks. To be detailed, we train our framework using
CelebA dataset [38] which is a face dataset with 202,599
face images from more than 10K subjects, with 40 differ-
ent attribute labels where each label is a binary value. We
adapt our Ed and Cd from VGG-16 [50], and the extracted
d in testing stage are directly utilized for the open-set recog-
nitions [34], without Ô¨Åne-tuning on the makeup datasets as
our VGG baseline method.

PR 2017 Dataset [51] collected 406 makeup and non-
makeup images from the Internet of 203 females. TCSVT
2014 dataset [12] incorporate 1002 face images. FAM
dataset [17] involves 222 males and 297 females, with 1038
images belonging to 519 subjects in total. It is worth notic-
ing that all these images are acquired under uncontrolled
condition. We follow the protocol provided in [29], and the
rank-1 average accuracy of FLF and state-of-the-art meth-
ods are reported in Table 3 as quantitative evaluation. The
performance of [29], VGG-baseline and FLF are beneÔ¨Åted
from the large scale training dataset in CelebA. We note that
the CelebA used in FLF and baseline, and even larger MS-
Celeb-1M databases [13] used in [29] have incorporated
several makeup variations.

With the prior information about the makeup recogni-
tion datasets, we systematically enforce our network to
be invariant to the makeup and skin(attr.id 5,19,27,30,37),
attractive(attr.id 4),age(attr.id 40), hair(attr.id 6-11,33,34),
beard(attr.id 18,23,25,31), expressions(attr.id 22,32), ac-
cessories(attr.id 17,35,36), which incorporate both the id-
relevant attributes (e.g., hair color) and id-irrelevant at-
tributes (e.g., smiling/not). Dispelling these id-relevant at-
tributes usually degrades the recognition accuracy in origi-
nal CelebA dataset, but achieve better generalization ability
on makeup face recognition datasets.

Since these attributes are very likely to be changed for
the subjects in makeup face recognition datasets, our FLF
can extracts more discriminative feature for better general-

By utilizing the valuable side labels (both main-task and
attributes) in CelebA in a controllable way, we achieve more
than 10% improvement over the baseline, and outperforms
STOA by ‚â•5.5% w.r.t TPR@FPR=0.1% in all datasets.

Face and face attributes recognition

We also take the open-set identiÔ¨Åcation experiments in
CelebA with an ID-independent 5-fold protocol. In Table
1, we have shown which 18 attributes can increase the gen-
eralization in CelebA, while 6 attributes will degrade the
accuracy in CelebA while improving the performance in
Makeup face recognition. The accuracy of FLF on CelebA
after dispelled 18 kinds of attributes is signiÔ¨Åcantly better
than its baselines. The VGG does not utilize the attribute la-
bel, the 19-head is a typical multi-task learning framework
which can be distracted by task-irrelevant s. We note that
CelebA is essentially an attributes datasets, there are few
works use it as the testing dataset w.r.t. identity.

Inversely, we can Ô¨Çexibly change our main-task as at-
tribute recognition and dispel the identity information. As
shown in Table 5, FLF outperforms the previous methods
with a relatively simple backbone following the standard
evaluation protocol of CelebA and LFWA [38] benchmarks.

than pixel-level IcGAN [48, 1], without the subsequent

Disguised face recognition

The disgust face in the wild (DFW) dataset [26] is a re-
cently leased benchmark, which has 11157 images from
1000 subjects. The mainstream methods usually choose
CelebA as pre-training dataset, despite it has a slightly
larger domain gap with CelebA than these makeup datasets.
In Table 6, we show the FLF can largely improve the
VGG baseline by 18% and 20.9% w.r.t GAR@1%FAR and
GAR@0.1%FAR respectively. It can also be used as a pre-
training scheme (FLF+MIRA) to complementary with the
state-of-the-art methods for better performance.

5. Conclusions

This paper presents a solution to extract discriminative
representation inheriting the desired invariance property for
both the latent and semantic variations. Besides, the vari-
ations are factorized and maintained in their codes. Such
separation can facilitate both the recognition and genera-
tion. As a result, we show that the invariant representation
is learned, and the three parts are complementary to each
other. In the future, we plan to facilitate several interesting
works in privacy data, generation and domain adaptation,
etc..
