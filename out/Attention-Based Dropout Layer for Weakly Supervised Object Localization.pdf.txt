Abstract

Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) tech-
niques learn the object location only using image-level la-
bels, without location annotations. A common limitation for
these techniques is that they cover only the most discrimi-
native part of the object, not the entire object. To address
this problem, we propose an Attention-based Dropout Layer
(ADL), which utilizes the self-attention mechanism to pro-
cess the feature maps of the model. The proposed method
is composed of two key components: 1) hiding the most
discriminative part from the model for capturing the inte-
gral extent of object, and 2) highlighting the informative
region for improving the recognition power of the model.
Based on extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the
proposed method is effective to improve the accuracy of
WSOL, achieving a new state-of-the-art localization accu-
racy in CUB-200-2011 dataset. We also show that the pro-
posed method is much more efﬁcient in terms of both param-
eter and computation overheads than existing techniques.

1. Introduction

Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) aims
to identify the location of the object in a scene only us-
ing image-level labels, not location annotations. Existing
approaches mine and track discriminative features of each
class for object detection [45, 36, 37, 9, 45, 25, 21, 41, 19,
2, 39, 15, 63, 7, 5, 4, 48, 14, 65, 32, 31, 58, 62, 8, 6] and seg-
mentation [33, 29, 18, 16, 24, 52, 50]. Because the discrim-
inative power of each object part is different from another,
these techniques tend to identify only the most discrimina-
tive part of the target object, incapable of covering entire
extent of the object. For example, in the case of a person,
the face may be more discriminative than the body which
appearance changes dramatically due to clothing.
In this
case, existing WSOL techniques can localize only the face,
not the entire region.

This problem can be critical

Speciﬁcally, Class Activation Mappings (CAM) [63] utilize

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classiﬁer for learn-
ing the discriminative features. The key idea is that the clas-
siﬁer with a reasonable accuracy should observe the object
region to decide the class label.
In other words, the dis-
criminative features should co-occur with the object region.
From this idea, they perform localization by tracking spatial
distribution of feature responses. Unfortunately, the classi-
ﬁers tend to focus only on the most discriminative features
to increase their classiﬁcation accuracy. Therefore, the spa-
tial distribution of feature responses also tends to cover only
the most discriminative part of the object, which leads to lo-
calization accuracy degradation.

Recently, various techniques [49, 35, 17, 59, 20, 52, 51,
60] have been proposed to address this issue. Most of them
[49, 17, 35, 59, 20] erased the most discriminative region
on the input image or feature map by zeroing that region
during the training phase. These techniques are similar to
the dropout [38] in that they deactivate speciﬁc nodes of the
feature map by setting them zero during the training phase.
This prevents the model from relying solely on the most
discriminative part for classiﬁcation, instead encourages it
to learn the less discriminative part as well. To achieve this
goal, Hide-and-Seek (HaS) [35] divides the input image into
grid-like patches and randomly selects the patches to erase.
While the random selection is simple and fast, it cannot ef-
fectively erase the most discriminative part.

For effectively removing only the most discriminative
part, several techniques [49, 17, 59, 20] have been proposed.
These techniques re-train the model multiple times [49, 17],
use additional classiﬁers [17, 59], or perform two forward-
backward propagations per one iteration [20] for ﬁnding
the most discriminative part. Consequently, huge additional
computing resources are required to eliminate the most dis-
criminative part effectively.

From previous methods, we conclude that the idea of
erasing only the most discriminative part is effective to
capture the full extent of object. However, existing meth-
ods require substantial computing resources to remove the
most discriminative part accurately. Our goal is to erase the
most discriminative part in an effective and efﬁcient way.
To this end, we propose an Attention-based Dropout Layer

Figure 1. ADL block diagram. The self-attention map is generated by channelwise average pooling of the input feature map. Based on the
self-attention map, we produce a drop mask using thresholding and an importance map using a sigmoid activation, respectively. The drop
mask and the importance map are selected stochastically at each iteration and applied to the input feature map. Please note that this ﬁgure
illustrates the case when the importance map is selected.

(ADL), a lightweight yet powerful method which utilizes
self-attention mechanism to remove the most discriminative
part of the target object.

Speciﬁcally, a self-attention map is obtained by perform-
ing channelwise average pooling on the input feature map.
Based on the self-attention map, we produce two key com-
ponents of ADL, a drop mask and an importance map. The
drop mask is used to hide the most discriminative part dur-
ing training. This induces the model to learn the less dis-
criminative part as well. We obtain this drop mask by
thresholding the self-attention map. The importance map
is used to highlight informative region for improving the
classiﬁcation power of the model. Owing to the importance
map, the more accurate self-attention map can be produced.
The importance map is computed by applying sigmoid ac-
tivation to the self-attention map. During training, either
one of the drop mask or importance map is stochastically
selected at each iteration, and then the selected one is ap-
plied to the input feature map by spatialwise multiplication.
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed method.

Compared to existing WSOL techniques, the proposed
method is much more efﬁcient in terms of both compu-
tation and parameter overheads. This is because we can
ﬁnd and erase the most discriminative region by a single
forward-backward propagation in a single model.
In ad-
dition, regardless of the model architecture, ADL can be
easily applied to convolutional feature maps of the model
to improve the localization accuracy. Compared to exist-
ing self-attention techniques [46, 12, 26, 53], the proposed
method is greatly lightweight because there are no addi-
tional trainable parameters for extracting self-attention map.

The proposed method is lightweight and efﬁcient, and
also report excellent accuracy. Quantitatively, the proposed
method achieves superior accuracy, more than 15 percent-
age points of accuracy improvement, over the existing state-
of-the-art techniques [59, 60] on CUB-200-2011 dataset
[44], and comparable accuracy to the current state-of-the-art

technique [60] on ImageNet-1k dataset [30]. We also ob-
serve consistent results in qualitative evaluation; the model
with ADL learns the less discriminative part better than the
vanilla model [63].

2. Related Work

Dropout. Dropout [38] is a regularization technique to al-
leviate overﬁtting in neural networks. Speciﬁcally, dropout
discards information by randomly zeroing each hidden node
of the neural network during the training phase. In this way,
the network can enjoy the ensemble effect of small subnet-
works, thus achieving a good regularization effect. How-
ever, unlike fully connected layers, applying dropout to the
convolutional feature map is not effective. One of the rea-
sons is that spatially adjacent pixels are strongly correlated
on the convolutional feature map; they share redundant con-
textual information. Hence, the conventional pixel-based
dropout cannot completely discard the information on the
convolutional feature map [42].

In order to apply dropout to the convolutional feature
map, Tompson et al. [42] proposed SpatialDropout that ran-
domly drops partial channels of a feature map, rather than
dropping each pixel. Based on this channel-based dropout,
the problem of pixel-level dropout can be resolved. The pro-
posed method differs from SpatialDropout in that we drop
only strongly activated regions, rather than dropping en-
tire region of channel. Owing to this region-based dropout,
we could also bypass the problem of pixel-level dropout.
Meanwhile, Park and Kwak [27] proposed MaxDrop, which
drops the maximally activated pixel through channelwise or
spatialwise on the feature map. Similar to MaxDrop, the
proposed method drops strongly activated part. However,
we differ from MaxDrop in that we use attention mech-
anism to ﬁnd the maximally activated part.
In addition,
the proposed method does not drop the maximally activated
pixel, but maximally activated region.

Attention mechanism. Humans selectively use an impor-
tant part of the data to make a decision [3, 13]. Similarly,
when a query comes in, the artiﬁcial model does not pro-
cess all the data equally, but focuses only on the impor-
tant data. This process is called attention mechanism and
is actively used in various ﬁelds such as machine transla-
tion [43], image captioning [55], image inpainting [56, 23],
transfer learning [57], visual question answering [64], and
generative model [28, 60]. When the query is input itself,
such attention is speciﬁcally called self-attention, which is
effective to learn the meaningful representation for conduct-
ing the given task. For example, in the case of the classiﬁ-
cation task, the self-attention map appears in a form that
emphasizes informative features for classiﬁcation (e.g., the
most discriminative part of the target object).

Recently, various methods [46, 47, 12, 26, 53] utilize the
self-attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy of the
CNN classiﬁcation model. Residual Attention Networks
(RAN) [46] has improved the accuracy of the classiﬁca-
tion model using 3D self-attention map. However, the pa-
rameter overheads are very large because the raw feature
map without any compression is used for attention extrac-
tion. Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [12] increases the ac-
curacy of the classiﬁcation model using only 1D channel
self-attention map. For extracting the self-attention map,
the feature map is ﬁrst compressed using Global Average
Pooling (GAP) and then passed through 2-layer MLP. In
this way, SE can signiﬁcantly reduce the parameter over-
heads for attention extraction compared to RAN. However,
the parameter overheads are still not negligible (e.g., 10%
on ResNet50 [10]).

Bottleneck Attention Module (BAM) [26] and Convolu-
tional Block Attention Module (CBAM) [53] increase the
accuracy of the classiﬁer by utilizing both 1D channel and
2D spatial self-attention maps. They compute the spatial
self-attention map using auxiliary convolutional layer(s).
The computed self-attention map is applied to the input fea-
ture map for rewarding the informative region. Likewise,
the proposed method uses the importance map for reward-
ing the informative region. However, the key difference
from them is that we stochastically penalize that region us-
ing the drop mask. Also, unlike these techniques, we do
not require additional trainable parameters for extracting the
self-attention map.

3. ADL: Attention-based Dropout Layer

In this section, we present details of the proposed
method, Attention-based Dropout Layer (ADL). ADL is ap-
plied on each feature map of classiﬁcation model, and in-
duces the model to learn the entire region of the object.
ADL generates a self-attention map from input feature map,
and produces a drop mask and an importance map. Al-
though both components are computed from self-attention

map, they play the opposite role. The drop mask penalizes
the most discriminative part for inducing the model to cover
the integral extent of the object. Meanwhile, the importance
map rewards the most discriminative part for increasing the
classiﬁcation power of the model. During training, the drop
mask or importance map is stochastically selected for each
iteration. Then, the selected one is applied to the input fea-
ture map. By applying each component stochastically, we
can enjoy their advantages simultaneously. ADL has two
main hyperparameters: drop rate and γ. The drop rate in-
dicates how frequently the drop mask is applied, and the γ
controls the size of the region to be dropped. The example
of each component is visualized in Figure 2.

Speciﬁcally, the input of ADL is a convolutional feature
map F ⊆ RH×W ×C . Note that C is the number of channels,
H and W are height and width, respectively. For simplicity,
we omit the mini-batch dimension in this notation. We gen-
erate a self-attention map Matt ⊆ RH×W by compressing
F using channelwise average pooling. Because the model
is trained for classiﬁcation, the intensity of each pixel in
the self-attention map is proportional to the discriminative
power. In this way, we can approximate the spatial distribu-
tion of the most discriminative part efﬁciently.

To obtain the drop mask, we ﬁrst set a drop threshold by
preﬁxed ratio γ of maximum intensity of the self-attention
map. Then, we produce the drop mask Mdrop ⊆ RH×W
by setting each pixel to 0 if it is larger than drop threshold,
and 1 if it is smaller. That is, the drop mask has 0 for the
most discriminative region and 1 for otherwise. Note that
the size of region to be dropped increases as γ decreases,
and vice versa. The drop mask is applied to the input feature
map by spatialwise multiplication. In this way, we can hide
the most discriminative part from the model; we encourage
the model to learn the less discriminative part for classiﬁca-
tion but meaningful region for localization. However, if the
drop mask is applied at every iteration, the most discrimi-
native part is never observed during the training phase. As
a result, the classiﬁcation accuracy of the model is signif-
icantly decreased, which adversely affects the localization
accuracy. To remedy this, we stochastically apply the drop
mask according to drop rate. When the drop mask is not
applied, the importance map is applied instead. We gen-
erate the importance map Mimp ⊆ RH×W from the self-
attention map by applying sigmoid activation. That is, the
intensity of each pixel in the importance map is close to 1
for the most discriminative region, and close to 0 for the less
discriminative region. Like the drop mask, the importance
map is applied to the input feature map by spatialwise mul-
tiplication. In this way, we can improve the classiﬁcation
accuracy of the model.

The proposed method is applied independently to each
convolutional feature map. Therefore,
it can be easily
plugged into multiple feature maps of existing classiﬁcation

Figure 2. Drop mask and self-attention map at each layer of VGG-GAP [63]. At lower-level layers, the self-attention maps include
general features, while class-speciﬁc features are included in the self-attention maps at higher-level layers. The drop masks also erase
most discriminative part more effectively at higher-level layers. Please note that the drop mask is overlaid with input image for better
visualization. Because the importance map has a distribution very similar to that of the self-attention map, we do not visualize it.

models for improving localization accuracy.
In addition,
it does not require any trainable parameters. That means,
there is no parameter overheads even when applied to multi-
ple feature maps at the same time. Furthermore, with ADL,
the most discriminative region can be identiﬁed and erased
efﬁciently, without auxiliary classiﬁers [17, 59], re-training
[49], or additional forward-backward propagation [20].

ADL is an auxiliary module which is applied only during
training. During the testing phase, ADL is deactivated. That
is, our testing phase is identical to that of vanilla model.
Therefore, the object localization can be performed using
various heatmap extraction methods [63, 31, 59, 20] with-
out bells and whistles. Note that we do not compensate the
different distributions between training and testing, as other
dropout-based WSOL techniques [17, 35, 59].
Relation with other attention extraction methods. Our
extraction method does not require trainable parameters,
much lightweight compared to existing methods [46, 12, 26,
53]. Thus, one might wonder how our method can produce
semantically meaningful results despite its simplicity.

Recently, Zagorukyo and Komodakis [57] showed that
the informative region for transfer learning can be identiﬁed
by applying the channelwise pooling to the convolutional
feature map. That is, the self-attention map for transfer
learning is obtained by the channelwise pooling. Inspired
by this, CBAM [53] utilized the self-attention map to im-
prove the classiﬁcation accuracy. Speciﬁcally, they reﬁne
the map using auxiliary convolutional layer and sigmoid ac-
tivation. This reﬁned self-attention map is applied to input
feature map by spatialwise multiplication. In this way, the
auxiliary convolutional layers are trained to reﬁne the self-
attention map for improving the classiﬁcation accuracy.

However, from the empirical study, we observe that the
self-attention map may not need to be reﬁned by auxiliary
layers. We conjecture that it is because existing convolu-
tional layers in CNN model are sufﬁciently powerful to pro-
duce meaningful self-attention map. Hence, after comput-
ing the self-attention map by channelwise average pooling,

we normalize this map using sigmoid activation and then
multiply it to input feature map. Then, the gradient from
the loss function updates existing convolutional layers so
that the resultant self-attention map is useful for improving
classiﬁcation accuracy. For example, if the self-attention
map fails to highlight the object region, this may degrade
the classiﬁcation accuracy. Hence, existing convolutional
layers are trained to produce more accurate self-attention
map. This is equivalent to assigning the role of the auxiliary
convolutional layer used in CBAM to the existing convolu-
tional layers in the model. Note that the similar principle
was introduced by Lin et al.
[22]; they replace the fully
connected layers of CNN classiﬁer with the GAP layer.

The improvement of classiﬁcation accuracy of our atten-
tion method may not be as great as that of CBAM. How-
ever, our method is much more efﬁcient and can produce
sufﬁciently meaningful results for our application. This is
shown in our experimental results; our self-attention map is
effective to increase classiﬁcation accuracy and identify the
most discriminative part of the target object.
Relation between drop mask and importance map. In
our model, the drop mask penalizes the most discriminative
part, while the importance map rewards the most discrim-
inative part. One might consider the drop mask and im-
portance map are mutually exclusive. However, our experi-
mental results support that they are not mutually exclusive.
We believe that it is because the drop mask can be accu-
rately produced by the importance map. Speciﬁcally, as the
importance map improves the classiﬁcation accuracy, the
more accurate self-attention map can be produced. Conse-
quently, the drop mask can more effectively erase the most
discriminative region of the object.
Relation between classiﬁcation and localization. Pre-
vious study [35] has reported that the classiﬁcation accu-
racy is compromised while the localization accuracy is in-
creased. They conjecture that this is caused by the usage
of a drop mask. Because we also use a drop mask to erase
the most discriminative part, such a trade-off relationship

between the accuracy of localization and that of classiﬁca-
tion is consistently observed in our experiments. However,
the proposed method can boost the classiﬁcation power us-
ing the importance map, thus the accuracy degradation of
classiﬁcation is not as signiﬁcant as other techniques.
Relation with the current state-of-the-arts. The current
state-of-the-art techniques for WSOL are Adversarial Com-
plementary Learning (ACoL) [59] and Self-Produced Guid-
ance (SPG) [60]. ACoL adds two auxiliary classiﬁers in
parallel to the backbone feature extractor for ﬁnding the
most discriminative part of the target object. The proposed
method differs from ACoL in that we can ﬁnd the most
discriminative part without the additional classiﬁer, which
is much more efﬁcient. Most recently, SPG has been pro-
posed, a new WSOL technique that utilizes spatial distribu-
tion of the object and background. The classiﬁer can learn
the integral extent of the object using that distribution as
auxiliary supervision. The proposed method differs from
SPG in that SPG does not erase the most discriminative part
of the object. In addition, SPG requires substantial comput-
ing resources for improving the localization accuracy.

4. Experimental Results

Dataset. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
method in CUB-200-2011 [44] and ImageNet-1k [30], re-
spectively. The ImageNet-1k is a large-scale dataset with
1,000 different classes, consisting of approximately 1.3 mil-
lion training images and 50,000 validation images. For this
dataset, we train the model with the training set and evaluate
the performance with the validation set.

The CUB-200-2011 includes 200 species of birds, con-
sisting of 5,994 training images and 5,794 testing images.
For this dataset, we train the model with the training set and
evaluate the performance with the testing set. The intra-
class variation of CUB-200-2011 is smaller than that of
ImageNet-1k, because all classes of this dataset belong to
birds. In this case, the extent of the most discriminative re-
gion might be quite small. For example, in Common Raven
and White-necked Raven, there is no difference in appear-
ance except the color of the neck. That is, the most discrim-
inative part is the neck, which is very small compared to the

entire area of the bird. Consequently, although CUB-200-
2011 is not a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet-1k, this
is a particularly challenging dataset to conduct WSOL.
Implementation details. We use VGG [34], ResNet [10],
MobileNetV1 [11], and InceptionV3 [40] as backbone net-
works. Note that we replace the last pooling layer and two
fully connected layers of VGG16 with a GAP layer, accord-
ing to [63]. We also use the customized InceptionV3 as a
backbone, following the SPG [60]. We plug SE block [12]
into ResNet50 for demonstrating the compatibility of ADL
with other self-attention methods. For ResNet and Mo-
bileNetV1, we set the stride of last strided convolution to
1 for enlarging the spatial resolution of heatmap to 14×14.
ADL is plugged in each feature map of the CNN model
in a sequential way; the output of ADL is the input of the
next layer. We use a pre-trained model which is trained
with ImageNet-1k dataset [30], and then ﬁne-tune the net-
work. We extract the heatmap from classiﬁcation model
using CAM [63]. Also, the bounding box is extracted from
the heatmap using the same method as presented in [63].
We implement the models using Tensorpack [54] on Ten-
sorﬂow [1], and train them using NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU.

Based on extensive ablation studies, we ﬁnd that it is op-
timal to apply ADL to intermediate and higher-level layers
of the network. Especially, for the intermediate layer, it is
preferable to apply it to bottleneck part (e.g., pooling layer
or strided convolution). We set the drop rate as 75%. For
the drop threshold, we set γ to 80% for VGG-GAP and In-
ceptionV3, 90% for ResNet, and 95% for MobileNetV1.
However, the hyperparameters mentioned here are only the
recommended settings. Note that the localization accuracy
can be further improved when the optimal setting is used.
Metrics. We use three evaluation metrics as [35]: Top-1
classiﬁcation accuracy (Top-1 Clas), Localization accuracy
with known ground-truth class (GT-known Loc), and Top-1
localization accuracy (Top-1 Loc). Top-1 Clas determines
that the answer is correct when the estimated class is equal
to the ground truth class. GT-known Loc judges the answer
as correct when the intersection over union (IoU) between
the ground truth bounding box and estimated box for the
ground truth class is 50% or more. Lastly, Top-1 Loc con-
siders the answer as correct when both Top-1 Clas and GT-

4.1. Ablation Study

In this subsection, we utilize pre-trained VGG-GAP [34,
63] as a backbone network. For training, we plug ADLs in
all the pooling layers and the conv5-3 layer, and then ﬁne-
tune the model using CUB-200-2011 dataset.

First, we visualize the self-attention map and drop mask
in Figure 2. We observe that the self-attention maps of
lower-level layers (i.e., pool1 and pool2) contain class-
agnostic general features. Meanwhile, the self-attention
maps of higher-level layers (i.e., pool4 and conv5-3) contain
the class-speciﬁc features. We also observe that the drop
masks from higher-level layers erase the most discrimina-
tive part more accurately than those from lower-level layers.
Next, we investigate the effect of drop rate on accu-
racy. The upper part of Table 1 reports the results. From
these results, we observe that the best localization accu-
racy can be achieved when the drop rate is 75%. Mean-
while, when the drop mask is applied at every iteration (i.e.,
drop rate 100%), the classiﬁcation (Top-1 Clas) and local-
ization (Top-1 Loc) accuracy are greatly reduced. This is be-
cause, as mentioned in Section 3, the model never observe
the most discriminative part. As a result, the classiﬁcation
power of the model decreases signiﬁcantly, which adversely
inﬂuences localization accuracy. Given that accuracy degra-
dation in GT-known Acc is relatively less than that of Top-1
Loc and that of Top-1 Clas, we can conclude that this is the
result of the classiﬁcation accuracy degradation.

We observe that the classiﬁcation accuracy increases as
the drop rate decreases. However, when the drop rate be-

comes too low (drop rate from 25% to 0%), the classiﬁ-
cation accuracy decreases again (from 68.99% to 67.78%).
We believe this is caused by overﬁtting. The drop mask
is a dropout-based technique and its rationale is similar to
MaxDrop [27]. Thus, the drop mask with proper drop rate
may prevent overﬁtting, increasing the classiﬁcation accu-
racy. We consider that the analysis of regularization effect
of the drop mask is beyond the scope of this paper. Yet, we
plan to analyze this rigorously in future work.

Third, we observe the effect of each component on the
accuracy by deactivating the importance map or drop mask,
respectively. The lower part of Table 1 summarizes the ex-
perimental results. From this, we can conﬁrm that applying
the drop mask and the importance map at the same time has
better localization accuracy than applying only one of them.
This supports the argument that the drop mask and impor-
tance map are not mutually exclusive.

When the importance map is applied alone, the classiﬁ-
cation accuracy increases but the localization accuracy de-
creases. We believe that this is because the classiﬁer focuses
more on the most discriminative part, guided by the impor-
tance map. This result supports our argument that the pro-
posed lightweight attention method is effective to improve
the classiﬁcation accuracy. On the other hand, when drop
mask is applied alone, the localization accuracy increases
but the classiﬁcation accuracy decreases. We believe that
this is because the model utilizes less discriminative parts
for classiﬁcation, guided by the drop mask. These results
also support the observation that the accuracy of localiza-
tion and classiﬁcation are in a trade-off relationship when
applying the drop mask [35].

Lastly, we investigate the effects in accuracy upon the
choice of feature maps where ADLs are employed and re-
port the results in Table 2. From these results, we can
see that applying ADLs to additional convolutional feature
maps further increases the localization accuracy. We ﬁnd
that the ADL can improve both localization and classiﬁ-
cation accuracy. However, the best localization accuracy
can be achieved by sacriﬁcing the classiﬁcation accuracy.
In addition, when the ADLs are applied to lower-level fea-

Table 3. Quantitative evaluation results on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1k. Bold text refers the best localization accuracy for each
backbone network. We also underline the best score in each dataset. Overheads are computed based upon their backbone networks. The
accuracy with asterisk* indicates that the score is from the original paper. We leave some Top-1 Clas scores blank, because they are not
reported in the original paper [60]. For reproducing baseline methods, we use hyperparameters suggested by their original papers [63, 35].
Also, we train and test HaS and ADL under the same setting for a fair comparison.

ture maps such as pool2 and pool1, the localization accu-
racy rather decreases. We believe that this is because the
lower-level feature maps include general features that are
not related to the target class. Consequently, the most dis-
criminative part cannot be effectively eliminated in lower-
level feature maps using ADL.

4.2. Comparison with State of the art Methods

We compare the proposed method with various recent
WSOL techniques including the state-of-the-art: CAM
[63], HaS [35], ACoL [59], SPG [60]. We report the ac-
curacy of ACoL and SPG from their original paper. Mean-
while, we train the backbone networks using the same pre-
processing method used in ACoL and SPG. Then, HaS or
ADL are applied on the backbone networks. Considering
the accuracy of vanilla model as baseline, we evaluate the
accuracy gain of HaS and ADL, respectively. Please note
that ACoL and SPG are the current state-of-the-art tech-
niques for WSOL. In addition, among the techniques with-
out parameter overheads, HaS performs the best.

Figure 3 visualizes the localization results on CUB-
200-2011 and ImageNet-1k dataset for qualitative evalua-
tion. From the results, we consistently observe that model
with ADL captures the less discriminative parts better than
vanilla model. For example, as seen from the left-most sam-
ple in the Figure 3, the heatmap and bounding box extracted
from vanilla model only highlight the face of birds. Con-
trarily, the model with ADL covers not only the face, but
also the entire part of the bird, from head to wing. In addi-
tion, from the right-most sample in the Figure 3, the vanilla
model focuses only on the cylinder of revolver, whereas the
model with ADL localizes the entire frame of the revolver.

Next, the quantitative evaluation results on CUB-200-
2011 and ImageNet-1k datasets are summarized in Table
3. To compare the computing resources required by each
technique, we have described the number of parameters
and both computation and parameter overheads along with
Top-1 Loc and Top-1 Clas. ADL has no parameter over-
heads, and the computation overheads are nearly zero (e.g.,
0.003% in ResNet50-SE) upon the backbone network. The
proposed method is much more efﬁcient than the existing
state-of-the-art techniques, ACoL and SPG, in terms of both
parameter and computation overheads.

We push further to maximize the efﬁciency of WSOL by
employing MobileNetV1 [11] as a backbone network. Due
to the lightweight nature of MobileNetV1, it is inappropri-
ate to employ ACoL or SPG which requires huge additional
computing resources. On the other hand, ADL and HaS can
be successfully employed despite a limited amount of re-
sources. From the experimental results, we can observe that
the accuracy gain of the proposed method is better than that
of HaS. In addition, HaS has reduced classiﬁcation accu-
racy against the baseline. This is caused by the trade-off re-
lationship between localization and classiﬁcation accuracy
discussed in Section 3. Fortunately, the importance map of
ADL can subside such a drawback by increasing the clas-
siﬁcation power. Consequently, the classiﬁcation accuracy
degradation of the ADL is not as signiﬁcant as that of HaS.
In addition to its high efﬁciency, the proposed method
achieves a new state-of-the-art localization accuracy on
CUB-200-2011 dataset. When ResNet50-SE is employed
as a backbone, the proposed method improves the local-
ization accuracy by more than 15 percentage points over
the state-of-the-art accuracy [59, 60]. Please note that the

2225

number of parameters of ResNet50-SE with ADL is much
smaller than that of ACoL and SPG. This achievement
is quite impressive, considering that recent techniques are
competing with the accuracy by 2-3 percentage points dif-
ference. Also, when the other three backbone networks are
employed, the proposed method achieves better localization
accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

In the ImageNet-1k experiments, when VGG-GAP is
used as a backbone, the accuracy of ADL is better than
that of CAM, but slightly lower than that of ACoL. How-
ever, when ResNet50-SE is used as a backbone, localiza-
tion accuracy of ADL is better than that of ACoL and com-
parable with that of SPG even though the required com-
puting resources are much lower. In addition, when Incep-
tionV3 is used as a backbone, comparable accuracy (0.11
percentage point difference) to SPG is achieved. In sum-
mary, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on CUB-
200-2011 dataset; on ImageNet-1k dataset, ADL achieves
comparable accuracy with the current state-of-the-art tech-
nique [60] despite its superior efﬁciency.

Discussion. We veriﬁed the proposed method on a single-
object detection task, following the current state-of-the-art
methods [59, 60]. However, it should be noted that the pro-
posed method can be also used to improve the weakly super-
vised semantic segmentation accuracy. The classiﬁer with
ADL is the same as its vanilla version during testing, thus it
can be easily combined with the weakly supervised seman-
tic segmentation framework, such as [18, 24].

Next, to analyze the substantial difference in our accu-
racy gain between two datasets, we investigate our failure
examples from ImageNet-1k experiments. From the failure
case, we observe that the classiﬁer extracts the discrimina-
tive features from the background which appears frequently
with the target object. Figure 4 illustrates such examples.
In the case of the snowmobile class, the target object often
co-occurs with snow. The vanilla model only focuses on the
snowmobile, while the model with ADL learns not only the
snowmobile, but also the snow and tree. This is because the
background frequently appearing with the object might be
the less discriminative region.

ImageNet-1k includes a wide variety of classes where
speciﬁc types of background co-occur with the target ob-
ject. In this case, the background has a certain level of dis-
criminative power. Therefore, the model is likely to learn
the background features when the most discriminative part
is dropped. Meanwhile, since all classes of CUB-200-2011
belong to birds, similar backgrounds appear regardless of
the classes (e.g. sky, tree). In other words, the background
of this dataset is nearly independent of classes, thus the
background is not a discriminative region [61]. As a result,
the model does not learn the features from the background
although the most discriminative part is hidden.

Figure 4. The failure case on ImageNet-1k experiments. The target
class is snowmobile. The model with ADL learns the less discrim-
inative region which is not included in object. Speciﬁcally, the
model captures not only the snowmobile, but also snow and tree.

This explains the gap of our accuracy gain for two
datasets; ADL has remarkable performance to induce the
classiﬁer to learn the less discriminative parts, as supported
by CUB-200-2011 evaluations. We believe that this prob-
lem might be critical for all WSOL methods inducing the
classiﬁer to learn the less discriminative part. Currently, it
seems non-trivial to solve this problem, thus we will address
this issue in future work. Lastly, we note that the gap is not
caused by the scale of dataset because ADL rarely fails for
ImageNet-1k classes sharing similar background statistics
(e.g., various breeds of dogs).

5. Conclusion

We presented an Attention-based Dropout Layer (ADL),
a novel weakly supervised object localization method that
induces the CNN classiﬁer to learn entire extent of the ob-
ject. The proposed method is much more efﬁcient and
lightweight than existing state-of-the-art methods.
In ad-
dition, the proposed method has achieved excellent perfor-
mance; new state-of-the-art accuracy on CUB-200-2011,
and comparable accuracy with current state-of-the-arts on
ImageNet-1k. We also demonstrate that the proposed
method can be easily applied to various CNN classiﬁers to
improve the localization accuracy. For the future work, we
will analyze the regularization effect of the drop mask. In
addition, we will address the problem that the model learns
the less discriminative region from outside of the object.
