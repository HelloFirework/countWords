Abstract

This paper addresses the problem of 3D pose estimation
for multiple people in a few calibrated camera views. The
main challenge of this problem is to ﬁnd the cross-view cor-
respondences among noisy and incomplete 2D pose predic-
tions. Most previous methods address this challenge by di-
rectly reasoning in 3D using a pictorial structure model,
which is inefﬁcient due to the huge state space. We pro-
pose a fast and robust approach to solve this problem. Our
key idea is to use a multi-way matching algorithm to cluster
the detected 2D poses in all views. Each resulting clus-
ter encodes 2D poses of the same person across different
views and consistent correspondences across the keypoints,
from which the 3D pose of each person can be effectively in-
ferred. The proposed convex optimization based multi-way
matching algorithm is efﬁcient and robust against missing
and false detections, without knowing the number of peo-
ple in the scene. Moreover, we propose to combine geo-
metric and appearance cues for cross-view matching. The
proposed approach achieves signiﬁcant performance gains
from the state-of-the-art (96.3% vs. 90.6% and 96.9% vs.
88% on the Campus and Shelf datasets, respectively), while
being efﬁcient for real-time applications.

1. Introduction

Recovering 3D human pose and motion from videos has
been a long-standing problem in computer vision, which
has a variety of applications such as human-computer in-
teraction, video surveillance and sports broadcasting.
In
particular, this paper focuses on the setting where there
are multiple people in a scene, and the observations come
from a few calibrated cameras (Figure 1). While remark-
able advances have been made in multi-view reconstruc-
tion of a human body, there are fewer works that address
a more challenging setting where multiple people interact
with each other in crowded scenes, in which there are sig-
niﬁcant occlusions.

Figure 1: This work proposes a novel approach for fast and
robust recovery of 3D poses of multiple people from a few
camera views. The main challenge is to establish consistent
correspondences of 2D observations among multiple views,
e.g., 2D human-body keypoints in images, which may be
noisy and incomplete.

Existing methods typically solve this problem in two
stages. The ﬁrst stage detects human-body keypoints or
parts in separate 2D views, which are aggregated in the
second stage to reconstruct 3D poses. Given the fact that
deep-learning based 2D keypoint detection techniques have
achieved remarkable performance [8, 30], the remaining
challenge is to ﬁnd cross-view correspondences between
detected keypoints as well as which person they belong to.
Most previous methods [1, 2, 21, 12] employ a 3D picto-
rial structure (3DPS) model that implicitly solves the cor-
respondence problem by reasoning about all hypotheses in
3D that are geometrically compatible with 2D detections.
However, this 3DPS-based approach is computationally ex-
pensive due to the huge state space. In addition, it is not
robust particularly when the number of cameras is small, as
it only uses multi-view geometry to link the 2D detections

nored.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for multi-
person 3D pose estimation. The proposed approach solves
the correspondence problem at the body level by matching
detected 2D poses among multiple views, producing clus-
ters of 2D poses where each cluster includes 2D poses of the
same person in different views. Then, the 3D pose can be
inferred for each person separately from matched 2D poses,
which is much faster than joint inference of multiple poses
thanks to the reduced state space.

However, matching 2D poses across multiple views is
challenging. A typical approach is to use the epipolar con-
straint to verify if two 2D poses are projections of the same
3D pose for each pair of views [23]. But this approach may
fail for the following reasons. First, the detected 2D poses
are often inaccurate due to heavy occlusion and truncation,
as shown in Figure 2(b), which makes geometric veriﬁca-
tion difﬁcult. Second, matching each pair of views sepa-
rately may produce inconsistent correspondences which vi-
olate the cycle consistency constraint, that is, two corre-
sponding poses in two views may be matched to different
people in another view. Such inconsistency leads to incor-
rect multi-view reconstructions. Finally, as shown in Fig-
ure 2, different sets of people appear in different views and
the total number of people is unknown, which brings addi-
tional difﬁculties to the matching problem.

We propose a multi-way matching algorithm to address
the aforementioned challenges. Our key ideas are:
(i)
combing the geometric consistency between 2D poses with
the appearance similarity among their associated image
patches to reduce matching ambiguities, and (ii) solving
the matching problem for all views simultaneously with a
cycle-consistency constraint to leverage multi-way informa-
tion and produce globally consistent correspondences. The
matching problem is formulated as a convex optimization
problem and an efﬁcient algorithm is developed to solve the
induced optimization problem.

In summary, the main contributions of this work are:

• We propose a novel approach for fast and robust multi-
person 3D pose estimation. We demonstrate that, in-
stead of jointly inferring multiple 3D poses using a
3DPS model in a huge state space, we can greatly re-
duce the state space and consequently improve both
efﬁciency and robustness of 3D pose estimation by
grouping the detected 2D poses that belong to the same
person in all views.

• We propose a multi-way matching algorithm to ﬁnd the
cycle-consistent correspondences of detected 2D poses
across multiple views. The proposed matching algo-
rithm is able to prune false detections and deal with
partial overlaps between views, without knowing the

true number of people in the scene.

• We propose to combine geometric and appearance
cues to match the detected 2D poses across views. We
show that the appearance information, which is mostly
ignored by previous methods, is important to link the
2D detections across views.

• The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-
art methods by a large margin without using any
training data from the evaluated datasets. The code
is available at https://zju3dv.github.io/

2. Related work

Multi-view 3D human pose: Markerless motion capture
has been investigated in computer vision for a decade. Early
works on this problem aim to track the 3D skeleton or ge-
ometric model of human body through a multi-view se-
quence [38, 43, 11]. These tracking-based methods require
initialization in the ﬁrst frame and are prone to local op-
tima and tracking failures. Therefore, more recent works
are generally based on a bottom-up scheme where the 3D
pose is reconstructed from 2D features detected from im-
ages [36, 6, 32]. Recent work [22] shows remarkable re-
sults by combing statistical body models with deep learning
based 2D detectors.

In this work, we focus on the multi-person 3D pose es-
timation. Most previous works are based on 3DPS models
in which nodes represent 3D locations of body joints and
edges encode pairwise relations between them [1, 20, 2, 21,
12]. The state space for each joint is often a 3D grid rep-
resenting a discretized 3D space. The likelihood of a joint
being at some location is given by a joint detector applied to
all 2D views and the pairwise potentials between joints are
given by skeletal constraints [1, 2] or body parts detected in
2D views [21, 12]. Then, the 3D poses of multiple people
are jointly inferred by maximum a posteriori estimation.

As all body joints for all people are considered simulta-
neously, the entire state space is huge, resulting in heavy
computation in inference. Another limitation of this ap-
proach is that it only uses multi-view geometry to link 2D
evidences, which is sensitive to the setup of cameras. As
a result, the performance of this approach degrades signif-
icantly when the number of views decreases [21]. Recent
work [23] proposes to match 2D poses between views and
then reconstructs 3D poses from the 2D poses belonging to
the same person. But it only utilizes epipolar geometry to
match 2D poses for each pair of views and ignores the cycle
consistency constraint among multiple views, which may
result in inconsistent correspondences.

Single-view pose estimation: There is a large body of
literature on human pose estimation from single images.

Figure 2: Overview of the proposed approach. Given images from a few calibrated cameras (a), an off-the-shelf human
pose detector is used to produce 2D bounding boxes and associated 2D poses in each view, which may be inaccurate and
incomplete (b). Then, the detected bounding boxes are clustered by a novel multi-view matching algorithm. Each resulting
cluster includes the bounding boxes of the same person in different views (c). The isolated bounding boxes that have no
matches in other views are regarded as false detections and discarded. Finally, the 3D pose of each person is reconstructed
from the corresponding bounding boxes and associated 2D poses (d).

Single-person pose estimation [41, 34, 42, 30, 17] local-
izes 2D body keypoints of a person in a cropped image.
There are two categories of multi-person pose estimation
methods: top-down methods [10, 17, 15, 13] that ﬁrst detect
people in the image and then apply single-person pose esti-
mation to the cropped image of each person, and bottom-up
methods [25, 29, 8, 35, 18] that ﬁrst detect all keypoints
and then group them into different people. In general, the
top-down methods are more accurate, while the bottom-
up methods are relatively faster.
In this work, We adopt
the Cascaded Pyramid Network [10], a state-of-the-art ap-
proach for multi-person pose detection, as an initial step in
our pipeline.

The advances in learning-based methods also make it
possible to recover 3D human pose from a single RGB im-
age, either lifting the detected 2D poses into 3D [28, 47,
9, 27] or directly regressing 3D poses [40, 37, 39, 45, 31]
and even 3D body shapes from RGB [4, 24, 33]. But the
reconstruction accuracy of these methods is not comparable
with the multi-view results due to the inherit reconstruction
ambiguity when only a single view is available.

Person re-ID and multi-image matching: Person re-ID
aims to identify the same person in different images [44],
which is used as a component in our approach. Multi-image
matching is to ﬁnd feature correspondences among a collec-
tion of images [16, 46]. We make use of the recent results
on cycle consistency [16] to solve the correspondence prob-

lem in multi-view pose estimation.

3. Technical approach

Figure 2 presents an overview of our approach. First, an
off-the-shelf 2D human pose detector is adopted to produce
bounding boxes and 2D keypoint locations of people in each
view (Section 3.1). Given the noisy 2D detections, a multi-
way matching algorithm is proposed to establish the cor-
respondences of the detected bounding boxes across views
and get rid of the false detections (Section 3.2). Finally,
the 3DPS model is used to reconstruct the 3D pose for each
person from the corresponding 2D bounding boxes and key-
points (Section 3.3).

3.1. 2D human pose detection

We adopt the recently-proposed Cascaded Pyramid Net-
work [10] trained on the MSCOCO [26] dataset for 2D pose
detection in images. The Cascaded Pyramid Network con-
sists of two stages: the GlobalNet estimates human poses
roughly whereas the ReﬁneNet gives optimal human poses.
Despite its state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, the
detections may be quite noisy as shown in Figure 2(b).

3.2. Multi view correspondences

Before reconstructing the 3D poses, the detected 2D
poses should be matched across views, i.e., we need to ﬁnd
in all views the 2D bounding boxes belonging to the same

37794

person. However, this is a challenging task as we discussed
in the introduction.

To solve this problem, we need 1) a proper metric to
measure the likelihood that two 2D bounding boxes belong
to the same person (a.k.a. afﬁnity), and 2) a matching algo-
rithm to establish the correspondences of bounding boxes
across multiple views. In particular, the matching algorithm
should not place any assumption about the true number of
people in the scene. Moreover, the output of the matching
algorithm should be cycle-consistent, i.e. any two corre-
sponding bounding boxes in two images should correspond
to the same bounding box in another image.

Problem statement: Before introducing our approach in
details, we ﬁrst brieﬂy describe some notations. Suppose
there are V cameras in the scene and pi detected bound-
ing boxes in view i. For a pair of views (i, j), the afﬁnity
scores can be calculated between the two sets of bounding
boxes in view i and view j. We use Aij ∈ Rpi×pj to de-
note the afﬁnity matrix, whose elements represent the afﬁn-
ity scores. The correspondences to be estimated between
the two sets of bounding boxes are represented by a partial
permutation matrix Pij ∈ {0, 1}pi×pj , which satisﬁes the
doubly stochastic constraints:

0 ≤ Pij 1 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ P T
ij

1 ≤ 1.

(1)

The problem is to take {Aij|∀i, j} as input and output
the optimal {Pij|∀i, j} that maximizes the corresponding
afﬁnities and is also cycle-consistent across multiple views.

Afﬁnity matrix: We propose to combine the appearance
similarity and the geometric compatibility to calculate the
afﬁnity scores between bounding boxes.

First, we adopt a pre-trained person re-identiﬁcation (re-
ID) network to obtain a descriptor for a bounding box.
The re-ID network trained on massive re-ID datasets is ex-
pected to be able to extract discriminative appearance fea-
tures that are relatively invariant to illumination and view-
point changes. Speciﬁcally, we feed the cropped image
of each bounding box through the publicly available re-ID
model proposed in [44] and extract the feature vector from
the “pool5” layer as the descriptor for each bounding box.
Then, we compute the Euclidean distance between the de-
scriptors of a bounding box pair and map the distances to
values in (0, 1) using the sigmoid function as the appear-
ance afﬁnity score of this bounding box pair.

Besides appearances, another important cue to associate
two bounding boxes is that their associated 2D poses should
be geometrically consistent. Speciﬁcally, the corresponding
2D joint locations should satisfy the epipolar constraint, i.e.
a joint in the ﬁrst view should lie on the epipolar line as-
sociated with its correspondence in the second view. Sup-
pose x ∈ RN ×2 denotes a 2D pose composed of N joints.

Figure 3: An illustration of cycle consistency. The green
lines denote a set of consistent correspondences and the red
lines show a set of inconsistent correspondences.

Then, the geometric consistency between xi and xj from
two views can be measured by the following distance:

Dg(xi, xj) =

1
2N

N

X

n=1

dg(xn

i , Lij(xn

j )) + dg(xn

j , Lji(xn

where xn
i denotes the 2D location of the n-th joint of pose
i, Lij(xn
j ) the epipolar line associated with xn
j from the
other view, and dg(·, l) the point-to-line distance for l. The
distances Dg are also mapped to values in (0, 1) using the
sigmoid function as the ﬁnal geometric afﬁnity scores.

Based on the fact that a pair of correctly detected and
matched 2D poses must satisfy the geometric constraint (Dg
is small), we combine the two afﬁnity matrices as follows:

Aij(·) = 

where Aij(·), Aa
ij(·) ∈ [0, 1] denote values
of the fused afﬁnity matrix, appearance afﬁnity matrix, and
geometry afﬁnity matrix of view pair (i, j), respectively. th
denotes a threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that
this simple combination of appearance and geometry is su-
perior to merely using one of them.

Multi-way matching with cycle consistency:
If there
are only two views to match, one can simply maximize
hPij, Aiji and ﬁnd the optimal matching by the Hungarian
algorithm. But when there are multiple views, solving the
matching problem separately for each pair of views ignores
the cycle-consistency constraint and may lead to inconsis-
tent results. Figure 3 shows an example, where the corre-
spondences in red are inconsistent and the ones in green are
cycle-consistent as they form a closed cycle.

We make use of the results in [16] to solve this prob-
lem. Suppose the correspondences among all m = PV

detected bounding boxes in all views are denoted by P ∈
{0, 1}m×m:

Finally, we solve the following optimization problem:

,

where Pii should be identity. Then, it can be shown that the
cycle consistency constraint is satisﬁed if and only if

rank(P ) ≤ s, P (cid:23) 0,

(4)

where s is the underlying number of people in the scene.
The intuition is that,
if the correspondences are cycle-
consistent, P can be factorized as Y Y T where Y ∈
Rm×s denotes the correspondences between all 2D bound-
ing boxes and 3D people.

As s is unknown in advance, we propose to minimize the
following objective function to estimate the low-rank and
positive semideﬁnite matrix P :

= −hA, P i + λ · rank(P ),

where A is concatenation of all Aij similar to the form in
(3), λ denotes the weight of low-rank constraint.

The beneﬁts of formulating the problem in this way are
two-fold. First, the cycle consistency constraint aggregates
the multi-way information to improve the matching and
prune the false detections, which can hardly be realized if
only two views are considered. Second, the rank minimiza-
tion will automatically recover a rank (the number of people
in the scene) that can best explain the observations.

Optimization: To make the optimization tractable, we
have to make appropriate relaxations. Instead of minimiz-
ing the rank, which is a discrete operator, we minimize the
nuclear norm kP k∗, which is the tightest convex surrogate
of rank [14]. We replace the integer constraint on P by
saying that P is a real matrix with values in [0, 1]:

Note that the problem in (9) is convex and we use the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [5] to
solve it. The problem is ﬁrst rewritten as follows by intro-
ducing an auxiliary variable Q:

−hA, P i + λkQk∗,

s.t. P = Q, P ∈ C.

where Y denotes the dual variable and ρ denotes a penalty

ternately updated until convergence. The overall algorithm
is shown in Algorithm 1, where D denotes the operator for
singular value thresholding [7] and PC(·) denotes the or-
thogonal projection to C.

(8)

Given the estimated 2D poses of the same person in dif-
ferent views, we reconstruct the 3D pose. This can be sim-
ply done by triangulation, but the gross errors in 2D pose
estimation may largely degrade the reconstruction. In order
to fully integrate uncertainties in 2D pose estimation and in-
corporate the structural prior on human skeletons, we make

57796

use of the 3DPS model and propose an approximate algo-
rithm for efﬁcient inference.

3D pictorial structure: We use a joint-based represen-
tation of 3D poses, i.e., T = {ti|i = 1, ..., N }, where
ti ∈ R3 denotes the location of joint i. Given 2D images
from multiple views I = {Iv|v = 1, ..., V }, the posterior
distribution of 3D poses can be written as:

p(T |I) ∝

V

N

Y

v=1

Y

i=1

p(Iv|πv(ti)) Y

(i,j)∈ε

p(ti, tj),

(12)

where πv(ti) denotes the 2D projection of ti in the v-th
view and the likelihood p(Iv|πv(ti)) is given by the 2D heat
map output by the CNN-based 2D pose detector [10], which
characterizes the 2D spatial distribution of each joint.

The prior term p(ti, tj) denotes the structural depen-
dency between joint ti and tj , which implicitly constrains
the bone length between them. Here, we use a Gaussian
distribution to model the prior on bone length:

p(ti, tj) ∝ N (kti − tjk|Lij, σij),

(13)

where kti − tjk denotes the Euclidean distance between
joint ti and tj , Lij and σij denote the mean and stan-
dard deviation respectively, learned from the Human3.6M
dataset [19].

Inference: The typical strategy to maximize p(T |I) is
ﬁrst discretizing the state space as a uniform 3D grid, and
applying the max-product algorithm [6, 32]. However, the
complexity of the max-product algorithm grows fast with
the dimension of the state space.

Instead of using grid sampling, we set the state space for
each 3D joint to be the 3D proposals triangulated from all
pairs of corresponding 2D joints. As long as a joint is cor-
rectly detected in two views, its true 3D location is included
in the proposals. In this way, the state space is largely re-
duced, resulting in much faster inference without sacriﬁcing
the accuracy.

4. Empirical evaluation

We evaluate the proposed approach on three public
datasets including both indoor and outdoor scenes and com-
pare it with previous works as well as several variants of the
proposed approach.

4.1. Datasets

The following three datasets are used for evaluation:

Campus [1]: It is a dataset consisting of three people inter-
acting with each other in an outdoor environment, captured
with three calibrated cameras. We follow the same evalua-
tion protocol as in previous works [1, 3, 2, 12] and use the

percentage of correctly estimated parts (PCP) to measure
the accuracy of 3D location of the body parts.
Shelf [1]: Compared with Campus, this dataset is more
complex, which consists of four people disassembling a
shelf at a close range. There are ﬁve calibrated cameras
around them, but each view suffers from heavy occlusion.
The evaluation protocol follows the prior work and the eval-
uation metric is also 3D PCP.
CMU Panoptic [20]: This dataset is captured in a studio
with hundreds of cameras, which contains multiple people
engaging in social activities. For the lack of ground truth,
we qualitatively evaluate our approach on the CMU Panop-
tic dataset.

4.2. Ablation analysis

We ﬁrst give an ablation analysis to justify the algorithm
design in the proposed approach. The Campus and Shelf
datasets are used for evaluation.

Appearance or geometry? As described in section 3.2,
our approach combines appearance and geometry informa-
tion to construct the afﬁnity matrix. Here, we compare it
with the alternatives using appearance or geometry alone.
The detailed results are presented in Table 1.

On the Campus, using appearance only achieves compet-
itive results, since the appearance difference between actors
is large. The result of using geometry only is worse be-
cause the cameras are far from the people, which degrades
the discrimination ability of the epipolar constraint. On the
Shelf, the performance of using appearance alone drops a
lot. Especially, the result of actor 2 is erroneous, since his
appearance is similar to another person. In this case, the
combination of appearance and geometry greatly improve
the performance.

Direct triangulation or 3DPS? Given the matched 2D
poses in all views, we use a 3DPS model to infer the ﬁnal
3D poses, which is able to integrate the structural prior on
human skeletons. A simple alternative is to reconstruct 3D
pose by triangulation, i.e., ﬁnding the 3D pose that has the
minimum reprojection errors in all views. The result of this
baseline method (‘NO 3DPS’) is presented in Table 1.

The result shows that when the number of cameras in
the scene is relatively small, for example, in the Campus
dataset (three cameras), using 3DPS can greatly improve
the performance. When a person is often occluded in many
views, for example, actor 2 in the Shelf dataset, the 3DPS
model can also be helpful.

Matching or no matching? Our approach ﬁrst matches
2D poses across views and then applies the 3DPS model to
each cluster of matched 2D poses. An alternative approach

No matching

Table 1: Ablative study on the Campus and Shelf datasets.
Appearance and geometry denote the different types of
afﬁnity matrices, i.e., using appearance only and using ge-
ometry only. ‘No 3DPS’ uses triangulation instead of the
3DPS model to reconstruct 3D poses. ‘No matching’ repre-
sents the 3DPS model without bounding box matching, an
approach typically used in previous methods [2, 21]. We re-
implement this approach with the state-of-the-art 2D pose
detector. The numbers are the percentage of correctly esti-
mated parts (PCP).

in most previous works [2, 21] is to directly apply the 3DPS
model to infer multiple 3D poses from all detected 2D poses
without matching. Here, we give a comparison between
them. As Belagiannis et al. [2] did not use the most recent
CNN-based keypoint detectors and Joo et al. [21] did not
report results on public benchmarks, we re-implement their
approach with the state-of-the-art 2D pose detector [8] for
a fair comparison. The implementation details are given in
the supplementary materials. Table 1 shows that the 3DPS
without matching obtained decent results on the Self dataset
but performed much worse on the Campus dataset, where
there are only three cameras. The main reason is that the
3DPS model implicitly uses multi-view geometry to link
the 2D detections across views but ignores the appearance
cues. When using a sparse set of camera views, the multi-
view geometric consistency alone is sometimes insufﬁcient
to differentiate the correct and false correspondences, which
leads to false 3D pose estimation. This observation coin-
cides with the other results in Table 1 as well as the observa-
tion in [21]. The proposed approach explicitly leverage the
appearance cues to ﬁnd cross-view correspondences, lead-
ing to more robust results. Moreover, the matching step
signiﬁcantly reduces the size of state space and makes the
3DPS model inference much faster.

Table 2: Quantitative comparison on the Campus and Shelf
datasets. The numbers are percentage of correctly estimated
parts (PCP). The results of other methods are taken from
respective papers. ‘Ours w/o 3DPS’ means using triangu-
lation instead of the 3DPS model to reconstruct 3D poses
from matched 2D poses.

model-based multi-person pose estimation and their method
was extended to the video case to leverage temporal consis-
tency [2]. Ershadi-Nasab et al. [12] is a very recent method
that proposed to cluster the 3D candidate joints to reduce
the state space.

The results on the Campus and Shelf datasets are pre-
sented in Table 2. Note that the 2D pose detector [10] and
the reID network [44] used in our approach are the released
pre-trianed models without any ﬁne-tuning on the evaluated
datasets. Even with the generic models, our approach out-
performs the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In
particular, our approach signiﬁcantly improves the perfor-
mance on Actor 3 in the Campus dataset and Actor 2 in the
Shelf dataset, which suffer from severe occlusion. We also
include our results without the 3DPS model but using trian-
gulation to reconstruct 3D poses from matched 2D poses.
Due to the robust and consistent matching, direct triangula-
tion also obtains better performance than previous methods.

4.4. Qualitative evaluation

Figure 4 shows some representative results of the pro-
posed approach on the Shelf and CMU Panoptic dataset.
Taking inaccurate 2D detections as input, our approach is
able to establish their correspondences across views, iden-
tify the number of people in the scene automatically, and
ﬁnally reconstruct their 3D poses. The ﬁnal 2D pose esti-
mates obtained by projecting the 3D poses back to 2D views
are also much more accurate than the original detections.

ing boxes and pose detections. The second row shows the result of our matching algorithm where the colors indicate the
correspondences of bounding boxes across views. The third row shows the 2D projections of the estimated 3D poses.

4.5. Running time

We report running time of our algorithm on the se-
quences with four people and ﬁve views in the Shelf dataset,
tested on a desktop with an Intel i7 3.60 GHz CPU and a
GeForce 1080Ti GPU. Our unoptimized implementation on
average takes 25 ms for running reID and constructing afﬁn-
ity matrices, 20 ms for the multi-way matching algorithm,
and 60 ms for 3D pose inference. Moreover, the results in
Table 2 show that our approach without the 3DPS model
also obtains very competitive performance, which is able to
achieve real-time performance at > 20fps.

5. Summary

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multi-view
3D pose estimation that can fastly and robustly recover 3D
poses of a crowd of people with a few cameras. Com-
pared with the previous 3DPS based methods, our key idea
is to use a multi-way matching algorithm to cluster the de-

tected 2D poses to reduce the state space of the 3DPS model
and thus improves both efﬁciency and robustness. We also
demonstrate that the 3D poses can be reliably reconstructed
from clustered 2D poses by triangulation even without us-
ing the 3DPS model. This shows the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-way matching algorithm, which leverages
the combination of geometric and appearance cues as well
as the cycle-consistency constraint for matching 2D poses
across multiple views.
