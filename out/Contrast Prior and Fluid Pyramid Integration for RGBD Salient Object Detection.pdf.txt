Abstract

The large availability of depth sensors provides valu-
able complementary information for salient object detec-
tion (SOD) in RGBD images. However, due to the inherent
difference between RGB and depth information, extracting
features from the depth channel using ImageNet pre-trained
backbone models and fusing them with RGB features di-
rectly are sub-optimal.
In this paper, we utilize contrast
prior, which used to be a dominant cue in none deep learn-
ing based SOD approaches, into CNNs-based architecture
to enhance the depth information. The enhanced depth cues
are further integrated with RGB features for SOD, using a
novel ﬂuid pyramid integration, which can make better use
of multi-scale cross-modal features. Comprehensive exper-
iments on 5 challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate
the superiority of the architecture CPFP over 9 state-of-
the-art alternative methods.

1. Introduction

Salient object detection (SOD) aims at distinguishing the
most visually distinctive objects or regions in a scene. It has
a wide range of applications, including video/image seg-
mentation [17, 40], object recognition [46], visual track-
ing [3], foreground maps evaluation [14, 15], image re-
trieval [6,16,22,38], content-aware image editing [8], infor-
mation discovery [58], photo synthesis [5, 29], and weakly
supervised semantic segmentation [52]. Recently, convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs) based methods [28, 36, 39]
have become the main stream for SOD tasks, achieving
promising results in challenging benchmarks [13]. How-
ever, existing CNNs-based SOD method mainly deal with
RGB images, which may produce unsatisfying results when
objects in the images share similar appearance with the
background stuff.

Depth information from popular devices, e.g., Kinect
and iPhone X, provides important complementary infor-

NLPR [42] and SSB [41]. Depth information plays an important
complementary role for ﬁnding the salient objects.

mation for identifying salient objects, as demonstrated in
Fig. 1. Although several RGBD based SOD benchmarks
[32, 42] and methods [4, 18, 20, 49] have been proposed in
the last few years, how to effectively utilize depth informa-
tion, especially in the context of deep neural networks [4],
remains largely unexplored.

Existing RGBD based SOD methods typically fuse RGB
and depth input/features by simple concatenation, either via
fusion at an early stage [42, 49], fusion at a late stage [18],
or fusion at a middle stage [20], as shown in Fig. 2. We ar-
gue that direct cross-modal fusion via simple concatenation
might be suboptimal due to two major challenges:

1) Shortage of high-quality depth maps.
Depth maps captured from state-of-the-art sensors are
much noisier and textureless than RGB images, posting a
challenge for the depth feature extraction. We lack well pre-
trained backbone networks for extracting powerful features
from depth maps, as an ImageNet [10] like large scale depth
maps dataset is unavailable.

2) Suboptimal multi-scale cross-modal fusion.
The two modalities, i.e., depth and RGB, have very dif-
ferent properties, making an effective multi-scale fusion of
both modalities difﬁcult. For instance, compared with the
rest colors, ‘green’ color has a much stronger correlation
with the ‘plants’ category. However, none depth value has
such a correlation. The inherent difference between the two
modalities may cause incompatibility problems when sim-
ple fusion strategies such as linear combination or concate-

3927

nation are employed.

Instead of extracting features from depth maps using Im-
ageNet pre-trained backbone networks, and then fusing the
RGB and depth information as done in existing approaches
[4, 18, 20, 49], we propose to enhance the depth informa-
tion using the contrast prior. Then the enhanced depth
map is used as an attention map to work with RGB fea-
tures for high-quality SOD results. Before the popularity
of CNNs, contrast prior used to be a dominant cue for dis-
covering salient objects, not only in computer vision com-
munity [2, 7, 30, 43], but also in neuroscience [11] and cog-
nitive psychology [50]. By re-employing the contrast prior
with our contrast-enhanced net, we bridge the representa-
tive CNN features from the RGB channel and the powerful
saliency prior from the depth channel. Speciﬁcally, we pro-
pose a contrast loss in the contrast-enhanced net by mea-
suring the contrast between salient and non-salient regions
as well as their coherence. Designed in a fully differen-
tiable way, the contrast-enhanced net can be easily trained
via back propagation and work with other CNN modules.

Effective multi-scale cross-modal feature fusion is de-
sired for high-quality RGBD based SOD. Different from
existing multi-scale feature fusion based CNN methods
[4, 27, 28, 55], we need to additionally take care of the fea-
ture compatibility problem. We design ﬂuid pyramid inte-
gration to fuse cross-modal (RGB and depth) information
in a hierarchical manner. Inspired by Hou et al. [28] and
Zhao et al. [55], our integration scheme contains a rich set
of short-connections from higher CNN layers to lower CNN
layers, while integrating features in a pyramid style. Dur-
ing the integration process, features from both modalities
pass through several non-linear layers, enabling the back-
propagation mechanism to adjust their representations for
better compatibility.

We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our model
designs via extensive ablation studies and comparisons.
Even with the simple backbone network (VGG-16 [48]),
our method demonstrates signiﬁcant performance when
compared with state-of-the-art RGBD-based SOD methods.
In summary, our main contributions are three-fold.

• We design a contrast loss to utilize the contrast prior,
which has been widely used in non-deep learning
based method, for depth map enhancement. Our
RGBD based SOD model successfully utilize the
strengths of both traditional contrast prior as well as
the deep CNN features.

• We propose a ﬂuid pyramid integration strategy to
make better use of multi-scale cross-modal features,
whose effectiveness has been experimentally veriﬁed.
• Without bells and whistles, e.g., HHA [24], superpix-
els [54] or CRF [33], our model outperforms 9 state-of-
the-art alternatives with a large margin, over 5 widely
used benchmark datasets.

2.1. SOD

Earlier work for SOD relies on various hand-designed
feature [7, 26, 37, 41]. Recently, learned representation is
becoming the de-facto standard with much-improved per-
formances. Li et al. [35] extracted multi-scale feature for
each superpixel by the pre-trained deep convolutional net-
work to derive the saliency map. The feature of three dif-
ferent scale bounding boxes surrounding each superpixel
is combined into a feature vector to integrate the multi-
scale information. In [56], Zhao et al. presented a multi-
context deep learning framework for salient object detection
in which two different CNNs are used to extract global and
local context information, respectively. Lee et al. [34] con-
sidered both high-level feature extracted from CNNs and
hand-crafted feature. The high-level feature and the hand-
craft feature encoded using multiple 1× 1 convolutional and
ReLU layers are fused into a feature vector. Among the
above-mentioned methods, the inputs are all superpixels so
that the models have to be run many times to obtain the
saliency object prediction results. Liu et al. [39] designed a
two-stage network, in which a coarse downscaled prediction
map is produced and reﬁned in a hierarchical and progres-
sive manner by another network. Li et al. [36] proposed a
deep contrast network, which not only considers the pixel-
wise information but also fuses the segment-level guidance
into the network. A deep architecture with short connection
is introduced in [28] which adds the connections from the
high-level feature to the low-level feature based on the HED
architecture [53].

2.2. RGBD based SOD

As shown in Fig. 2, existing RGBD saliency object de-
tection approaches can be divided into three categories.
The ﬁrst scheme, as represented in Fig. 2(a), fuses the in-
put in the earliest stage and regards the depth map as one
channel of input directly [42, 49]. Fig. 2(b) stands for the

3928

Concatenate（a）（c）（b）ModelModelJoint decisionFeature fusionPredictPredictModelModelModelModelsecond scheme which employs the “late fusion” strategy.
More speciﬁcally, individual predictions from both RGB
and depth are produced, and the results are integrated into
a separate post-processing step such as pixel-wise summa-
tion and multiplication. For example, Fan et al. [18] used
depth contrast and depth weighted color contrast to mea-
sure the saliency value of the regions. Fang et al. [19] used
the depth extracted from DC-T coefﬁcients to represent the
energy for image patches. Cheng et al. [9] computed the
saliency by laws of the visually salient stimuli in both color
and depth spaces. Besides, Desingh et al. [12] leveraged
nonlinear support vector regression to fuse these predicted
maps. The third scheme, as shown in Fig. 2(c), combines
the depth feature and RGB feature extracted from different
networks. For instances, Feng et al. [20] proposed novel
RGBD saliency feature to capture the spread of angular di-
rections. Similarly, R.Shigematsu et al. [47] proposed to
capture background enclosure, as well as low-level depth
cues.

Recently, CNNs are adopted in RGBD saliency detec-
tion failed to obtain the more discriminative learning-based
feature. CNNs-based methods almost belong to the third
scheme as mentioned above.
In [44], Qu et al. ﬁrstly
generated RGB and depth feature vectors for each super-
pixel/patch, then fed these vectors into a CNN to derive the
saliency conﬁdence value, ﬁnally used a Laplacian prop-
agation to obtain the ﬁnal saliency map. Han et al. [25]
proposed a two-view(RGB and depth) CNN to obtain the
feature from RGB images and corresponding depth image,
then simultaneously connected these feature with a new
fully connected layer to get the ﬁnal saliency map. Chen
et al. [4] designed a progressive fusion method. For fusing
the multi-scale information, it skip-connects the predictions
from all the deeper layers to the shallower layers. While the
information in different scales has been predicted as predic-
tion map before fusing, that is to say, the cross-modal com-
plementing for the feature is already ﬁnished before multi-
scale fusing.

3. Proposed Method

The overall architecture CPFP is shown in Fig. 3.
Feature-enhanced module(FEM) and ﬂuid pyramid integra-
tion are applied in VGG-16. Based on contrast prior, FEM
enhances RGB features at ﬁve stages of VGG-16. Details
are introduced in Sec. 3.1. Then multi-scale cross-modal
features are integrated by the ﬂuid pyramid. Please see de-
tails in Sec. 3.2.

3.1. Feature enhanced Module(FEM)

consisting of a Contrast Enhance Net to learn an enhanced
depth map and a Cross-Modal Fusion strategy for feature
modulation. The feature-enhanced Module is independent
of network backbone for RGB stream. Here we use the
VGG-16 suggested in [4] for fair comparison and the last
three layers are truncated. VGG-16 network includes ﬁve
convolution blocks and the outputs of the blocks are [2, 4,
8, 16, 32] times down-sampled respectively. As shown in
Fig. 3, we add a feature-enhanced module(FEM) at the end
of each block to obtain enhanced feature. FEM contains
contrast enhanced net and cross-modal fusion, which will
be introduced in Sec. 3.1.1 and Sec. 3.1.2.

3.1.1 Contrast-enhanced Net(CEN)

Motivated by previous work [14], the contrast between
foreground and background as well as uniform distribution
in the foreground are dominant in SOD. To use this prior ef-
fectively, we design a contrast loss in our contrast-enhanced
net. The structure of Contrast Enhance Net is illustrated in
Fig. 3. To measure the effect of contrast loss scientiﬁcally,
for the other parts in CEN we choose several common lay-
ers and simple structure, which will not dominate the per-
formance. The parameter details are introduced in Sec. 4.1.
Contrast loss contains three items:
the foreground object
distribution loss l f , the background distribution loss lb and
the whole depth image distribution loss lw. In our case, we
simply regard the salient objects in an image as the fore-
ground objects.

Firstly, the enhanced map should be coherent with the
original depth map for both foreground and background ob-
jects. Therefore, for the generated enhanced map, the fore-
ground object distribution loss l f and the background distri-
bution loss lb could be represented as:

l f = − log (1 − 4 ∗ ∑
(i, j)∈F

lb = − log (1 − 4 ∗ ∑
(i, j)∈B

(pi, j − ˆp f )2

),

(1)

F and B are the salient object area and background in the
ground truth. N f and Nb denote the number of pixels in
salient object and background, respectively. Similarly,
ˆp f
and ˆpb represent the mean of values in the foreground and
in the background of enhanced map, respectively.

ˆp f = ∑
(i, j)∈F

(2)

We propose to enhance the feature from RGB input by
modulating them with information from the depth map.
However, simply modulating with depth map may degen-
erate the ﬁnal performance as depth maps are usually noisy.
Instead, we propose a novel Feature-enhanced Module

As deﬁned in Eqn. 1, we model the internal variance of
salient objects and background to promote consistency with
the original depth map. A sigmoid layer is used to squash
the outputs of the Contrast Enhance Net to [0, 1]. In this
case, the maximum variance of the internal variance is 0.25,

Figure 3. Architecture CPFP. The architecture contains two modules: feature-enhanced modules(FEM) and ﬂuid pyramid integration
module. FEM contains two submodules: Contrast-enhanced net and cross-modal fusion. In contrast-enhanced net, we utilize a novel
contrast loss to leverage the contrast prior in the deep network to generate the enhanced map, and then get the enhanced features by the
cross-modal fusion at all the 5 stages of VGG-16. The ﬂuid pyramid integration method is designed to fuse the multi-scale cross-modal
features. The details of our architecture are introduced in Sec. 3.

thus we multiply the variance by 4 to ensure the range of the
log function is from 0 to 1.

Secondly, the contrast between the foreground and back-
ground objects should be enhanced. Hence we deﬁne the
whole depth image distribution loss lw as:

lw = − log ( ˆp f − ˆpb)2

.

(3)

We ensure the contrast between foreground objects and
background as large as possible by modeling the mean dif-
ference. The ˆp f and ˆpb are between 0 and 1, thus the value
of the parameter in the log function range from 0 to 1.

Finally, the contrast loss lc can be represented as:

lc = α1l f + α2lb + α3lw ,

(4)

where α1 and α2 and α3 are pre-deﬁned parameters. We
suggest setting them to 5, 5 and 1 respectively.

As shown in Fig. 4, the enhanced depth maps have higher
contrasts compared with the original depth maps. Besides,
The distributions in foreground and background are more
uniform.

3.1.2 Cross-modal Fusion

Cross-modal fusion is a sub-module of the feature-
enhanced module which aims at modulating RGB feature
with the enhanced depth map. The role of the one-channel
enhanced map is similar to the attention map [21, 51]. To

be speciﬁc, we multiply the RGB feature maps from each
block by the enhanced depth map to enhance the contrast of
feature between salient and non-salient regions. A residual
connection is further added to preserve the original RGB
feature. We call these feature maps enhanced feature ˜F,
which is computed as:

˜F = F + F ⊗ DE ,

(5)

F is the original RGB feature and DE denotes the enhanced
map generated by the proposed contrast enhanced net. ⊗
denotes the pixel-wise multiplication.

As shown in Fig. 3, by plugging the feature-enhanced
module into the end of each block, we obtain enhanced fea-
tures of ﬁve different scales, ˜F1, ˜F2, ˜F3, ˜F4, ˜F5, respectively.
3.2. Fluid Pyramid Integration(FPI)

When dealing with cross-modal information, feature
compatibility is the key point. Motivated by the recent suc-
cess in multi-scale feature fusion, we design a ﬂuid pyramid
architecture as shown in Fig. 3. The ﬂuid pyramid can make
fuller use of cross-modal feature in the multi-scale level,
which helps to ensure feature compatibility.

Concretely, our pyramid has 5 tiers. The ﬁrst tier is com-
posed of ﬁve nodes and each node is a set of enhanced fea-
tures of different scales. Then, we construct the ﬁrst node
of the second tier by up-sampling ˜F2, ˜F3, ˜F4, ˜F5 to the same
size as ˜F1 and adding these up-sampled features. Similarly,
we up-sample ˜F3, ˜F4, ˜F5 to the same size as ˜F2 and adding

3930

way, for the nth(n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) tier of the pyramid, there
are n nodes in total and each node is integrated with all the
higher-level information from the (n − 1)th tier of the pyra-
mid (0th in this case turns back to the modiﬁed VGG-16
backbone). Followed by a transition convolution layer and
a sigmoid layer, we obtain the ﬁnal saliency map P. Com-
pared with [4] which concatenates the predicted saliency
maps, the proposed integration approach works on the fea-
ture maps. While feature reserves richer cross-modal infor-
mation before fused in multi-scale level. That is to say, ﬂuid
pyramid integrates information in both multi-scale level and
cross-modal level. Compared with [55] which fuses fea-
tures in the traditional pyramid way, FPI leads all the high-
level features into low-level features for every node at each
tier of the pyramid by richer connection, which called ﬂuid
connection. Fluid connection provides more interactions for
cross-modal features in different scales, which helps feature
compatibility in multi-scale level.

Inspired by [53], we add deep supervisions to the en-
hanced depth map of each scale. Therefore, the total loss L
could be represented as:

L = ls +

5
∑
i=1

lci ,

(6)

where ls represents the cross-entropy loss between the pre-
dicted map and saliency ground truth. lci represent the con-
trast loss in the ith feature enhance module. Contrast loss
has been mentioned above and cross-entropy loss could be
computed as:

l f = Y log P + (1 −Y ) log(1 − P),

(7)

where P and Y denote the predicted map and saliency
ground-truth map, respectively.

4. Experiments
4.1. Implementation Details

The proposed idea is generally independent of the net-
work backbone. In this work, we choose VGG-16 [48] for
a fair comparison. The proposed network is implemented
using the Caffe library [31]. Following [4], we randomly
select 1400 samples from the NJU2000 [32] and 650 sam-
ples from the NLPR [42] for training. We also sample 100
images from NJU2000 and 50 from NLPR as the validation
set. The rest images are for testing. We randomly ﬂip the
images in the training set for data augmentation.

Parameter details in Contrast-enhanced Net. We sim-
ply use two convolutional layers followed by ReLU layers,
repeatedly to ensure that the enhanced maps have the same
size as the original feature map. In the ﬁrst convolutional
layer, kernel size, number of channel and stride are set to
be (4, 32, 2). In the second convolutional layer, kernel size,

number of channel and stride are set to be (3, 32, 1). Af-
ter repeating this two-layer block until feature maps hold
the same size as RGB feature in fusion position. Then two
more convolutional layers are followed. Their kernel size,
channel number and stride are (3, 32, 1) and (3, 1, 1) re-
spectively. After that, the output is thrown into a sigmoid
layer to generate the ﬁnal enhanced map. A sigmoid layer
is adopted to ensure that the values of enhanced map fall in
the range [0, 1].

Training. During the training phase, we train our net-
work for 10,000 iterations. The initial learning rate is set to
1e-7 and divided by 10 after 7,000 iterations. Weight de-
cay and momentum are set to 0.0005 and 0.9, respectively.
We train our network on a single NVIDIA TITAN X GPU.
The batch size and iter size are set to 1 and 10, respectively.
The parameters of newly added convolutional layers are all
initialized with Gaussian kernels. For image whose length
or width is larger than 400, we resize it to new length and
width, in which the maximum value is 400 while keeping
the length-width ratio unchanged.

Inference. During the inference phase, we resize the
predicted saliency maps to keep the same resolution as orig-
inal RGB images.
4.2. Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

Datasets. We conduct our experiments on 5 following
widely used RGBD datasets. NJU2000 [32] contains 2003
stereo image pairs with diverse objects and complex, chal-
lenging scenarios, along with ground-truth map. The stereo
images are gathered from 3D movies, the Internet, and pho-
tographs taken by a Fuji W3 stereo camera. NLPR [42]
is also called RGBD1000 dataset which including 1,000
images. There may exist multiple salient objects in each
image. The structured light depth images are obtained by
the Microsoft Kinect under different illumination condi-
tions. SSB [41] is also called STEREO dataset, which
consists of 1000 pairs of binocular images. LFSD [37]
is a small dataset which contains 100 images with depth
information and human labeled ground truths. The depth
information was obtained via the Lytro light ﬁeld camera.
RGBD135 [9] is also named DES which consists of seven
indoor scenes and contains 135 indoor images collected by
Microsoft Kinect.

Evaluation Metrics. We adopt 4 commonly used met-
rics, namely S-measure, mean F-measure, max F-measure
and mean absolute error (MAE), and the recently released
structure measure (S-measure [14]) to evaluate the perfor-
mance of different methods [2].

The F-measure is a harmonic mean of average precision

and average recall, formulated as:

Fβ =

(1 + β 2)Precision × Recall

β 2 × Precision + Recall

,

(8)

we set β 2 = 0.3 to weigh precision more than recall as

Let P and Y denote the saliency map and the ground truth
that is normalized to [0, 1]. For fair comparison on non-
salient regions [2], we compute the MAE score by:

where W and H are the width and height of the saliency

Both MAE and F-measure metrics ignore the structure
similarity assessment, however, behavioral vision studies
have shown that the human visual system is highly sensi-
tive to structures in scenes [14]. Thus, we additionally in-
troduce the S-measure [14] for a more comprehensive eval-
uation. The S-measure combines the region-aware (Sr) and
object-aware (So) structural similarity as their ﬁnal structure
metric:

S − measure = α ∗ So + (1 − α) ∗ Sr ,

(10)

where α ∈ [0, 1] is the balance parameter and set 0.5.

4.3. Ablation Experiments and Analyses

In this section, we explore the effect of different compo-

nents in the proposed method on the NJU2000 dataset.

Feature-enhanced Module. To prove the effectiveness
of the proposed contrast-enhanced net. We compare the re-
sults of using the backbone(denoted by B) with the results
adding FEM in the backbone(denoted by B + C). As shown
in Tab. 2, comparing the 1st and 3rd rows, we could see

gions is promoted and meanwhile the values in these regions be-
come more consistent.

that the proposed FEM brings obvious improvement. In ad-
dition, we show some visual comparisons between depth
images and their enhanced maps in Fig. 4. Obviously, com-
pared with the original depth images, the contrast between
salient and non-salient regions is promoted and meanwhile
the value within both regions become more consistent. Be-
sides, we also evaluate the results directly using the original
depth maps as enhanced maps(denoted by B + D, the 2nd
row in Tab. 2), which shows that B + D have negative ef-
fects. It is reasonable. From the original depth map shown
in Fig. 4, we can see that contrast between salient and no-
salient regions is not obvious enough and there are more
noises within salient region and background. While B + C
makes a difference, the visual instances are shown in Fig. 6.
Comparing the results generated by the backbone(B, the 3rd
column in Fig. 6) and backbone fusing original depth map
(B + D, the 4th column Fig. 6), we could see that origi-

nal depth map does not work well. When we add our pro-
posed feature-enhanced module into the backbone to fuse
the cross-modal information, the results are shown in the
5th column of Fig. 6 (B + C). Regions that are mistaken
for the salient object in the backbone are successfully re-
moved with the help of depth information.
It shows that
after enhancing depth maps with contrast prior, depth in-
formation helps a lot when detection from RGB features
meets difﬁculties. For example, some regions in RGB maps
are noisy(because of color, texture, brightness, et al.) are in
trivial distribution in depth level.

Fluid Pyramid Integration. Compared with some tra-
ditional multi-scale methods [36, 55], the proposed integra-
tion can utilize information more fully, which helps cross-
modal feature compatibility in multi-scale levels. In Tab. 2,
the 3rd and last rows show the performance before adding
FPI(B + C) and after adding FPI(B + C + FP). Numeri-
cally, the pyramid integration strategy is very effective and
contributes by nearly ten percentage points. To illustrate
the role of pyramid architecture, we ﬁrstly adopt the simple
fusion method in which we up-sample the multi-scale fea-
tures to the same size and concatenate them directly [36] as
shown in the lower right of Fig. 5. We denote this method
as B + C + M and show the performance in the 4th row in
Tab. 2. The results show that the help of this multi-scale
fusion method is very limited. Then we use a pyramid ar-
chitecture to fuse these feature hierarchically [55] as shown
in the upper left of Fig. 5, which is denoted as B + C + P
in the 5th row of Tab. 2. Numerically, the pyramid fusion is
much more effective than the direct fusion method and con-
tributes improvement by nearly four points. Then we add
the ﬂuid connection on the pyramid, the result is further
improved as shown in the 6th row. Visually, as shown in
Fig. 6, compared the results between the 5th (B + C) and the
6th (B + C + M) column. It could be seen that after fusing

the multi-scale information, the edge details have been im-
proved. But the non-salient region which has been shielded
by contrast prior(5th column) comes out again. The reason
behind this phenomenon is that the cross-modal information
fusing meets feature compatibility problem in multi-scale
level. Then we leverage the pyramid architecture (B + C
+ P) to fuse the multi-scale information more fully. Non-
salient region becomes smaller because features comple-
ment better. After we add the ﬂuid connection (B + C + FP),
fusing the high-level features into the low-level features at
each tier of the pyramid, the location of the salient object
becomes much better. Feature complementing achieves the
best performance.

4.4. Compare with the State of the art

We compare our model with 9 RGBD based salient
object detection models including LHM [42], GP [45],
LBE [20], SE [23], CTMF [25], DF [44], MDSF [49],
CDCP [57], and PCF [4]. Note that all the saliency maps
of the above methods are produced by running source codes
or pre-computed by the authors. For all the compared meth-
ods, we use the default settings suggested by the paper. For
works which do not release the code currently, we appreci-
ate the author helping to run the results.

As shown in Tab. 1, our method outperforms the state-
of-the-art methods on most evaluation metrics contain Max
F-measure, Mean F-measure and MAE. Compared with re-
cently proposed CNNs-based methods, our method has ob-

5. Conclusion

In Fig. 7, we show some visualization results. Especially,
we summarize several challenging situations in salient ob-
ject detection:
low contrast, complex scene, small object
and multiple objects. As shown in Fig. 7, we show a simple
example in the 1st row and almost methods perform well. In
2nd-3rd rows, we show some low contrast images in which
the color differences between the salient object and back-
ground are not obvious. However, if their depth difference
is obvious as the showed samples, we could leverage these
depth information to help the model to detect the salient
objects. Compared with the early methods(right), our re-
sults are more complete. Compared to the learning-based
methods such as PCF [4] and CTMF [25], the details are
much better. Besides, we also sample some images (4th-5th
rows) whose scene is complex. In these images, other meth-
ods mistake the background for the salient object due to the
complexity of scene. However, our model performs very
well. These two types of images further illustrate that the
proposed way of using the depth information is reasonable.
Then, we show other two challenging situations, small ob-
ject and multiple objects. In these challenging cases, it can
be seen that our model not only locates the salient object
well through high-level information but also segment ob-
jects well through low-level information.

In this paper, we develop a contrast-enhanced net super-
vised by a novel contrast loss for depth images. The pro-
posed net enhances depth maps explicitly, based on contrast
prior. Then enhanced map works with RGB features, to
enhance the contrast between the salient and non-salient re-
gions, and meanwhile guarantee the coherence within these
regions. Besides, we design a ﬂuid pyramid integration
method to make better use of the multi-scale cross-modal
features. Compared with multi-scale fusing strategies for
single-modal features, ﬂuid pyramid integration is designed
fuller for cross-modal fusing in multi-scale level, to deal
with feature compatibility better. Our approach signiﬁ-
cantly advances the state-of-the-art over the widely used
datasets and is capable of capturing salient regions under
challenging situations.
