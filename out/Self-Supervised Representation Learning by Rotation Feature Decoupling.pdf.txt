Abstract

We introduce a self-supervised learning method that fo-
cuses on beneﬁcial properties of representation and their
abilities in generalizing to real-world tasks. The method
incorporates rotation invariance into the feature learning
framework, one of many good and well-studied proper-
ties of visual representation, which is rarely appreciated
or exploited by previous deep convolutional neural net-
work based self-supervised representation learning meth-
ods. Speciﬁcally, our model learns a split representation
that contains both rotation related and unrelated parts. We
train neural networks by jointly predicting image rotations
and discriminating individual instances. In particular, our
model decouples the rotation discrimination from instance
discrimination, which allows us to improve the rotation pre-
diction by mitigating the inﬂuence of rotation label noise, as
well as discriminate instances without regard to image rota-
tions. The resulting feature has a better generalization abil-
ity for more various tasks. Experimental results show that
our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on
standard self-supervised feature learning benchmarks.

1. Introduction

Deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural
networks (ConvNets), have led to breakthroughs in the ﬁeld
of computer vision. Given large scale manually labeled im-
age datasets, e.g. ImageNet, ConvNets can be well trained
by back propagation and achieve state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on many tasks such as image classiﬁcation [25, 45]
and object detection [31]. Rich representations extracted
by these networks often serve as good general-purpose fea-
tures not only for the task where the network was trained,
but also for many other vision tasks like semantic segmenta-
tion [33] and visual question answering [2]. However, train-
ing deep neural networks in a fully supervised manner re-
quires a tremendous amount of efforts on manual labeling,
which could be infeasible in some real-world scenarios.

As an alternative to supervised feature learning, unsu-
pervised methods that do not rely on expensive and time-

consuming human labeling are receiving increasingly more
attention. The recently emerged self-supervised learning
paradigm [10, 43, 52, 27, 37] is a scalable and promising
solution for learning useful general-purpose visual repre-
sentations. These methods used to exploit the structural in-
formation of data itself and deﬁne pretext tasks that relates
to the ﬁnal application of the learned features to train neural
network. In pretext tasks, supervisory signals can be easily
developed without signiﬁcant human efforts, and thus mas-
sive readily available images can be applied for training.

Over the last few years, many different pretext tasks have
been proposed for self-supervised learning. For example,
one category of these methods tries to recover one part of
the data from the other part itself [43, 28, 53]. While a
shortcoming of these approach is the requirement of re-
constructing and predicting image pixel values, which of-
ten need signiﬁcant computational resources. Deep neural
networks can also be trained to differentiate original images
from restored incomplete images [21]. However, generating
synthetic images is not always an easy feat. Siamese net-
work architecture has been investigated in self-supervised
learning [2, 36, 53], but memory consumption is usually
huge. Another different but popularly adopted strategy is to
discover supervisory signals in videos like tracking image-
patches [47] and sorting frame sequences [30].

Most of existing works focus on designing various pre-
text tasks, while seldom caring about what properties are
owned by the learned representations and whether they are
indeed beneﬁcial for the generalization in real-world tasks.
For example, high-level representations should convey a
clear explanation or certain dependencies of factors of vari-
ation [5]. A recent attempt is to predict image rotations [17].
Features learned in this method can generalize well in var-
ious tasks, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. How-
ever, these features are discriminative with rotation trans-
formation and therefore cannot beneﬁt vision tasks that are
in favor of rotation invariance. Moreover, it is instructive to
note that not all examples are rotation determinable in prac-
tice. The orientation of an image is ambiguous not only for
round objects, but also for many other objects in images that
are orientation agnostic, for instance, some objects viewed
from top or in symmetrical shape, as shown in Figure 1.
Rotating these objects would not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence our
description or understanding.

In this paper, we present a new self-supervised learning
algorithm that decouples representations through a rotation
prediction task and an instance discrimination task. The
learned example feature consists of two ingredients that are
rotation discriminative and rotation unrelated, respectively.
Rotation discriminative features can be discovered by pre-
dicting image rotations, which is simple yet effective and
achieves state-of-the-art results on some benchmarks [17].
Regarding those orientation agnostic images in the dataset,
automatically assigned rotation labels usually contain noise,
which naturally leads to a positive unlabeled learning prob-
lem. Original images in the default orientation are positive
instances while the rotated copies are unlabeled instances,
which can be positive or negative. If the transformation of
a rotated copy cannot be recognized unequivocally, we treat
it as a positive instance with default orientation in the unla-
beled set (See Figure 1 in supplementary material). On the
other hand, we learn rotation unrelated features by penal-
izing the distance difference between features of the same
image under different rotations. Non-parametric method is
applied to distinguish different instances based on these ro-
tation unrelated features. Hence, the features would have
the discriminative ability on instance level.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-supervised
learning method, we conduct experiments on standard fea-
ture transfer learning benchmarks. We perform ablation
studies to examine individual components in our model and
different conﬁgurations. We also test the features on rotated
dataset. Experimental results suggest that it is necessary to
investigate rotation related and unrelated features. Features
learned in our method outperform those of the state-of-the-
art methods on many tasks including linear classiﬁcation on
ImageNet and Places, as well as classiﬁcation, detection and
segmentation on PASCAL VOC.

2. Related work

This work relates to several topics in machine learning
and computer vision: self-supervised learning, positive un-
labeled (PU) learning and image rotation invariance.

Self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning con-
structs some supervisory signals directly computed from the
input data. For example, some methods try to recover part
of the data itself, such as image completion [43], image col-
orization [52, 27, 28] and channel prediction [53]. Others
leverage concept information in images and then construct
constraints, such as image patch position [10, 36], solv-
ing jigsaw puzzle [37], counting [38], rotation [17] and in-
stance discrimination [13, 48]. Methods relying on adver-
sarial training include [12] and [21]. Noroozi et al. [39] and
Caron et al. [6] use clustering approach to generate pseudo-
labels. Apart from single task, Doersch and Zisserman [11]
and Ren and Lee [44] also consider using several tasks to-
gether to obtain performance boost. For videos, some exam-
ples of supervisory signals are: egomotion [1, 42], temporal
coherence [47, 30] and sound [41]. Our method is based
on predicting image rotations [17] and considers properties
owned by the learned representations. We focus more on
rotation related and unrelated property.

Positive unlabeled learning. Unlabeled data in PU
learning are generally treated as negative examples, which
means only the observed negative examples contain noisy
labels [14]. Many methods look into the relationship
between the conditional probability and its estimation to
model the mislabeled rate [46, 40]. Then the mislabeled
rate can be used to handle noisy observed negative ex-
amples by various ways such as excluding examples with
low conﬁdence [40], labeling examples with high conﬁ-
dence [49, 23, 19] or reweighting examples [14, 35, 32].
However, PU learning methods that possess good theoreti-
cal properties may not properly scale up to deep networks
trained with millions of examples. In this work, we formu-
late the task of predicting image rotations as a PU learning
problem and deal with the label noise by applying weights
to unlabeled examples.

Rotation invariance. Many classical hand-crafted fea-
tures like SIFT [34] and RIFT [29] for computer vision are
insensitive to certain rotation transformations. For recent
ConvNets based feature learning, some carefully designed
network structure, such as G-CNNs [7] and Warped Convo-
lutions [20], exhibit excellent results in learning rotational
invariant features. Invariance to arbitrary set of transforma-
tions can be realized through data augmentation. Laptev et
al. [26] extract max-pooled activation of multiple rotational
copies of images. Dieleman et al. [9] expand the feature
maps by combining various transformed features. These in-
variant representation learning methods are mainly trained
in supervised tasks. We aim to learn compound features that
contain rotation unrelated part in an unsupervised way. Our

which learns instance weights to reduce the inﬂuence of rotation ambiguous images. The other part is trained with a distance penalty loss

method also relies on multiple rotational copies of the data,
while we utilize this rotation information efﬁciently for two
decoupled unsupervised tasks.

3. Rotation feature decoupling

In this section, we ﬁrst review the method of predicting
image rotations (RotNet) [17], and then reformulate it as
a positive-unlabeled learning problem that mitigates the in-
nate defects in the design of this pretext task. We describe in
detail of our rotation feature decoupling approach and give
our complete model (See Figure 2).

where l is the cross-entropy loss for classiﬁcation problem.
The transformations are deﬁned as rotations by multiples of
90 degrees, i.e. K = 4, and g(X; y) means rotating image
X counterclockwise by (y − 1) · 90 degree.

The basic premise of RotNet is that rotating an image
will change the orientation of objects in the image, which
should be easily identiﬁed. To predict image rotation, the
neural network has to recognize and localize salient object
parts in the image. The well-trained neural network can
therefore produce an accurate feature for salient object in
the image and these features can be easily transferred to
real-world tasks, such as detection and segmentation.

3.1. Image rotation prediction

3.2. Noisy rotated images

ConvNets are particularly powerful in mapping raw im-
age to a semantically meaningful feature vector, but they are
often trained using images and their corresponding ground
truth labels. To obtain a general-purpose feature for an im-
age in an unsupervised way, RotNet investigates geometric
transformations of image, speciﬁcally rotations of image by
multiples of 90 degrees, as supervisory signals, and trains
ConvNet to predict their transformation [17]. Semantically
meaningful representation can therefore be encoded in the
feature maps of higher layers of the ConvNet.

Given a training dataset S = {Xi}N

i=1 of N images,
the RotNet deﬁnes a set of rotational transformation G =
{g(X; y)}K
y=1 for each image X. We denote the i-th image
with the y-th rotation by Xi,y, where Xi,y = g(Xi; y). A
ConvNet model F (·; θ) is trained to classify each rotated
image to one of the transformations. The objective is:

The prerequisite introduced in the rotation prediction
model could be satisﬁed for most natural images, which
generally have objects in an up-front posture. This kind of
images usually have a default orientation. Any rotations of
the image will result in an unusual object orientation, which
can be speciﬁed by human eyes without any doubt. Many
instances in datasets like ImageNet have such observations,
and are appropriate for the rotation prediction task.

Despite of its simplicity and effectiveness, this premise
will fail for many objects in images that are orientation ag-
nostic, for instance some objects viewed from top or in sym-
metrical shape (see Figure 1). Recognizing the exact ro-
tation transformation for these images would be meaning-
less in practice, and applying ConvNets in any case with-
out thinking will only introduce confounders to the model
training. Moreover, features learned in RotNet are discrim-
inative toward the rotation angle. They are not favored in a
rotation agnostic image dataset like plankton [8] and ISBI
2012 electron microscopy segmentation challenge [3]. Here

10366

we ﬁrst describe ways to reduce the inﬂuence of noisy ro-
tation labels and introduce learning rotation unrelated fea-
tures in the next subsection.

We regard original images in the dataset as being in
default orientation and label them as positive examples.
The unlabeled examples include all rotated copies, some
of which are still in the default orientation after rotation.
Therefore,
the automatically assigned rotation labels of
these images are noisy for RotNet. Predicting whether
an input image is rotated is hence a binary classiﬁcation
problem if all unlabeled data are treated as negative exam-
ples [4]. In PU learning, it is shown that the estimated con-
ditional probability is related to the noise rate and the con-
ﬁdence of an example being clean [40, 19]. We propose to
weight each rotated image using estimated probability, and
reduce the relative loss of rotation ambiguous images.

At ﬁrst, a ConvNet model is trained to conduct binary
classiﬁcation. We denote by ˜F (Xi,y) the probability of an
image being positive estimated from this pre-trained model.
We add a weight for each instance to the cross-entropy loss
with tunable parameter γ, i.e.

which predicts image rotations while mitigating the inﬂu-

3.3. Feature decoupling

Image features that solely relate to image rotations are
not practical for downstream tasks involving rotation agnos-
tic images. An alternative solution is to complement rota-
tion related feature with additional feature that is unrelated
to image rotations. We achieve this goal by developing a
feature decoupling algorithm, which learns a semantic fea-
ture that is partly discriminative with respect to image rota-
tions and partly unrelated to it. The ﬁrst part of the feature
enjoys the beneﬁts inherited from the task of estimating im-
age rotations. Being unrelated to image rotations, the other
part is suitable for some orientation agnostic tasks.

Rotation classiﬁcation. We suppose that the high-
level feature of an image X can be represented as f =

(cid:2)f (1) ⊺, f (2) ⊺(cid:3)⊺, where f (1) is explicitly related to image ro-

tation while f (2) is responsible for information that are unre-
lated to rotation transformation. We denote by the ConvNet
based feature extractor Ff (·; θf ) with parameters θf , which
maps an input rotated image Xi,y into a ﬁxed size vector

fi,y = Ff (Xi,y; θf ). A classiﬁer Fc(·; θc) takes feature
f (1)
i,y as the input to estimate the rotation type of the image.
The rotation classication loss function can be expressed as

Lc =

(4)

which is different from Eq. (3) as only part of feature f are
used here to recognize the rotation.

Rotation irrelevance. Toward the goal of rotation un-
related feature, we enforce similarity between features of
the same image with different rotation angles. Formally,
given rotated copies of an image: {Xy}K
y=1, their features
{f (2)
y=1 are expected to be similar with each other as
much as possible. We address this by minimizing the dis-
tance between each feature {f (2)
y=1 and their mean fea-
ture vector ¯f = 1

y , and write the objective as

For calculation efﬁciency, we adopt Euclidean distance, i.e.
d(x, y) = kx − yk2.

However, this objective alone will lead to a trivial solu-
tion. Although features of the same image under different
rotations are similar, the network could simply output the
same vector (e.g. zero vector) regardless of the input im-
age. Hence beyond Eq. (5), we expect rotation unrelated
features to be discriminative w.r.t.
image instances rather
than rotation types. Non-parametric classiﬁcation [48] can
be applied to avoid such degenerate solution.

Image instance classiﬁcation. The feature f (2) is ex-
pected to be more similar with each other for the same im-
age under different rotations than those for different images.
Since features of rotated copies of an image have already
been constrained to be close to their mean feature vector
in Eq. (5), we proceed to distinguish and spread out these
mean features.

In non-parametric classiﬁcation, the probability of pre-

dicting image X as the i-th instance in the dataset is:

well as adopt noise constative estimation (NCE) and prox-
imal regularization [48]. The objective is to minimize the

the actual data distribution and Pn denotes the uniform dis-
tribution for noise in NCE. ˆf ′ is the normalized feature from
another image.

The resulting model comprises three core modules: ro-
tation classiﬁcation (Eq. (4)), rotation irrelevance (Eq. (5))
and image instance classiﬁcation (Eq. (8)), and can be writ-
ten as

We concatenate f (1) and f (2) to represent an input image.
The image feature consists of rotation related and unrelated
components, both of which contain rich high-level sematic
image representation. f (1) will contain necessary informa-
tion, for example salient object location and its default ori-
entation, to predict image rotations. On the other hand, f (2)
has no information related to rotation and focuses more on
the differences of every single images.

4. Experiments

In this section, we conduct experiments to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach.
If the visual represen-
tations learned in unsupervised manner are effective and
general-purpose, they will generalize well to various tasks.
We ﬁrst qualitatively analyze the network learned with the
proposed algorithm. Then we report the results on several
standard transfer learning benchmarks.

4.1. Implementation details

For comparison with previous works, we use a standard
AlexNet architecture implemented by pytorch [24] with re-
duced number of channels as the feature extractor Ff (·; θf ).
It consists of ﬁve convolutional layers and two fully con-
nected layers. We leave out the Local Response Normal-
ization (LRN) layers and add Batch Normalization (BN)
after each linear layers, which is a common procedure in
recent self-supervised learning approaches [10, 52, 12, 53,
17, 48, 44, 6]. The decoupled features f (1) and f (2) are sim-
ply set to have same dimension, i.e. the representation f is
split into two halves. We implement the rotation classiﬁer
Fc(·; θc) as a one-layer linear network. The value of hyper-
parameters γ, τ and m in our model are 2, 0.07 and 4096,

respectively. We simply set the parameters λc, λr and λn
for loss balance all as 1. We train the model for 200 epochs
in total on ILSVRC 2012 training set. The learning rate is
set to 0.01 initially and then decayed by a factor of 10 every
40 epochs after the ﬁrst 90 epochs. The network is trained
with momentum of 0.9, a batch size of 192 and an l2 penal-
ization of the weights θ with 5 · 10−4.

4.2. Qualitative analysis

Nearest-neighbor retrieval. Self-supervised training is
expected to assign similar features to semantically similar
images. We ﬁrst perform nearest-neighbor retrieval on Im-
ageNet ILSVRC 2012 validation set to test the ability of
learned features in capturing semantic meanings. We com-
pare to the RotNet baseline to see the effect of feature de-
coupling. For our model, we obtain features from the 4,096
dimensional vector outputted by the feature extractor net-
work Ff (·; θf ). Accordingly, for RotNet the features are
extracted from the fc7 layer. We use cosine-similarity to
calculate the distance between features.

Retrievals of some examples are arranged from left to
right in order of increasing distance in Figure 3. Both Rot-
Net and the proposed model are able to capture semantics
in images for some categories. The results of randomly
selected images, which contain salient objects and are ro-
tation unambiguous, are satisfactory for both RotNet and
our model. Our model can sometimes capture more ﬁne-
grained similarity. For example, on second row, the Rot-
Net retrieves some similar background plants rather than
the foreground object bird. For bullet train, our model suc-
cessfully ﬁnd images in the same category rather than just
general vehicles. Additionally, for some rotation agnostic
image queries, the RotNet fail to extract latent information
for objects in images. Many images retrieved by RotNet
are totally unrelated to the query (marked with red bor-
der). This is likely because the RotNet focuses more on the
shape of object and is less discriminative toward different
instances. On the contrary, our model can return more se-
mantically similar images for these queries, which conﬁrms
our model’s discriminative ability on instance level.

Filter visualizations. To better understand the ﬁlers and
features learned in our approach, we use different network
visualization techniques. Figure 4 shows the ﬁlters from
the ﬁrst layer [25], synthetic images that maximize some
activation [15, 50] and maximally activating images [51]
for some channel of each convolutional layers. We ﬁnd that
deeper layers in our model seem to capture more complex
and abstract textural structures.

4.3. Linear classiﬁcation on activations

Following Zhang et al. [52], we train linear classiﬁers
on top of the features extracted by different convolutional
layers. This classiﬁcation result represents the task spe-

ciﬁc power of the learned representation, speciﬁcally the
discriminative power over object class. As usual, we per-
form this study on both ILSVRC 2012 [45] and the Places
dataset [54]. All weights of the feature extractor network
are frozen and feature maps are spatially resized (with adap-

tive max pooling) so as to have around 9,000 elements. Re-
sults are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. All ap-
proaches in table use AlexNet based network and were pre-
trained on ImageNet without labels except the ImageNet-
labels, Places-labels, and Random entries.1 We report the
best numbers for each method reported in [36, 39]. We also
provide results of non-linear classiﬁcation on ImageNet in
the supplementary material.

On ImageNet, our approach outperforms the state-of-
the-art from conv3 to conv5. Our results on conv1
and conv2 are comparable to previous results and the
ImageNet-label entry. Note that the lower layers of the net-
work usually capture low-level information like edges or
contours in images, and with relatively low transfer accu-
racies, these features are generally less often used directly.
It is important to note that the performance of most previ-
ous works degrades along the neural network depth. In stark
contrast, we successfully diminish the gap with ImageNet-
label on higher layers. The largest improvement (7.8%) is
achieved on conv5 layer, which usually extracts abstract
semantic information. This suggests that high-level features
extracted by our method are more promising for practical
use.

On Places dataset, the results of our approach exhibit
similar trends with that on ImageNet. We achieve best accu-

have group or reduced number of channels, which will have 50% more pa-
rameters in convolutional layers and typically cause a performance boost.
In this paper we also report results on this network.

accuracies from conv1 to conv3. On conv5 layer we
outperform the state-of-the-art by 3.7%.

4.4. Multi label classiﬁcation, object detection and

semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC

We test the transferability of the learned feature on PAS-
CAL VOC dataset [16]. We use our unsupervised trained
network Ff (·; θf ) as the initialization model for tasks on
PASCAL. Performance is measured by mean average preci-
sion (mAP) for classiﬁcation and detection, and by mean in-
tersection over union (mIU) for segmentation. During trans-
fer, we absorb the batch normalization parameters into their
preceding linear layers and do not use BN layers during
ﬁne-tuning. The data-dependent rescaling method proposed
by Kr¨ahenb¨uhl et al. [22] is used to rescale the weights in
all experiments as is standard practice. Table 3 summarizes
the comparison of our approach with other methods. We
outperform previous methods on all these three tasks.

Classiﬁcation on PASCAL VOC 2007. We use the
open source protocol provided by Kr¨ahenb¨uhl 2 to perform
multi-label classiﬁcation. We ﬁne-tune either the whole net-
work or only fc6-8 layers on trainval set and evaluate on
test set. Our approach can improve upon RotNet, the cur-
rent best method on classiﬁcation. It can be observed that

2https://github.com/philkr/voc-classiﬁcation

the bigger AlexNet model will lead to a performance im-
provement.

Detection on PASCAL VOC 2007. For object detection
our self-supervised trained network is used as the initial-
ization of Fast-RCNN [18]. We use the publicly available
testing framework provided by Girshick [18] and use multi-
scale training and single-scale testing. The weights of the
ﬁrst layer are ﬁxed during ﬁne-tuning as it is the default set-
ting in Fast-RCNN. With a mAP of 57.5% we achieve the
best result. Per class detection performance of our method
is also provided in the supplementary material.

Segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012. We ﬁne-tune
our model using FCN [33] on PASCAL VOC 2012 train set
and evaluate on val set. Our approach outperforms state-of-
the-art by 2.7%.

4.5. Discussion

Ablation studies. To see the inﬂuence of each compo-
nent in our model, we conduct ablation studies on ImageNet
linear classiﬁcation with ﬁxed features. We compare the
individual performance of the rotation prediction task (Ro-
tation), rotation unrelated instance classiﬁcation (Instance),
the combination of these two tasks (Rotation + Instance),
and the full model taking into consideration noisy labels in
the unlabeled set (PURotation + Instance). The middle four
rows in Table 4 shows the resulting performance of differ-
ent components. The model performs best when rotation

discrimination, noisy labels and instance discrimination are
all considered.

Different conﬁgurations. We evaluate the effect of var-
ious design choices by linear classiﬁcation on ImageNet.
We compare different structures of the feature extractor
network Ff (·; θf ):
the convolutional layers of AlexNet
(conv5), conv5 with one fully connected layer (fc6),
and conv5 with two fully connected layers (fc7). Results
are summarized at the lower three rows in Table 4. Higher
layers learn better feature when feature decouples at higher
layers. It is interesting to notice that performance of lower
layers tend to decrease. This might because effective gra-
dient information help less on lower layers when the loss
function is applied on higher layers.

Rotation feature evaluation. We ﬁnally demonstrate
that the decoupled feature is better suitable when the images
in downstream tasks exhibit rotational symmetry. To do
this, we rotate the images in PASCAL VOC 2007 by multi-
ples of 90 degrees (speciﬁcally 90, 180 and 270) and eval-
uate on classiﬁcation task. The rotated dataset has 20,044
images for training and 19,808 for test (4 times as many as
the original dataset). Each instance with different rotation
angles shares the same class label. We train a linear classi-
ﬁer directly on top of the ﬁrst half (rotation related) features
f (1), second half (rotation unrelated) features f (2) and the

compound decoupled features. Results for ImageNet-labels
and baseline RotNet are produced by us and are reported for
reference. We also consider ﬁne-tuning fc6-8 for three
different methods. As shown in Table 5, the learned feature
of RotNet and our rotation related half performs poorly. The
reason is that they are discriminative w.r.t. image rotations
and do not have a good generalization ability in a rotated
dataset. This result reveals that it is beneﬁcial to consider
both rotation related and unrelated features. Our method
is more suitable in vision tasks that are in favor of rotation
invariance.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented an unsupervised repre-
sentation learning method that learns semantically mean-
ingful features containing rotation related and unrelated
parts. Our approach decouples predicting image rotations
from discriminating individual instances. The transfer of
features achieves improved performance over state-of-the-
art methods on standard self-supervised learning bench-
marks. The advantages of decoupled feature are further
demonstrated in rotation agnostic tasks. We believe that
incorporating more well-analyzed properties of representa-
tion for self-supervised learning is beneﬁcial to generaliza-
tion and is a promising future direction.
