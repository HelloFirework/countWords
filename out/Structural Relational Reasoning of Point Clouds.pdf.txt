Abstract

The symmetry for the corners of a box, the continuity for
the surfaces of a monitor, the linkage between the torso
and other body parts — it suggests that 3D objects may
have common and underlying inner relations between local
structures, and it is a fundamental ability for intelligent
species to reason for them.
In this paper, we propose
an effective plug-and-play module called the structural
relation network (SRN) to reason about
the structural
dependencies of local regions in 3D point clouds. Existing
network architectures on point sets such as PointNet++
capture local structures individually, without considering
their inner interactions. Instead, our SRN simultaneously
exploits local information by modeling their geometrical
and locational relations, which play critical roles for our
humans to understand 3D objects. The proposed SRN
module is simple,
interpretable, and does not require
any additional supervision signals, which can be easily
equipped with the existing networks. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets indicate promising boosts on the
tasks of 3D point cloud classiﬁcation and segmentation by
capturing structural relations with the SRN module.

1. Introduction

Recent years have witnessed rapid development on 3D
point cloud data due to the popularity of varying scanning
devices. Typically, point cloud data is represented by s-
parse and unordered 3D points. Compared with 2D im-
ages which usually have regularly arranged pixels, it is
more challenging to analyze 3D point clouds with the ir-
regular structures [39]. Early works mainly focus on ex-
tracting hand-crafted 3D features, which aim to exploit sta-
tistical properties of point sets and are especially designed

3D objects. In the ﬁgure, red ellipses represent repetitive symmet-
ric local regions, orange ellipses are continuous surfaces (on which
the local structures share the same plane), and green ellipses show
the junctions of connected parts. We observe that most real-world
3D objects contain highly related local structures and it is a funda-
mental ability for our humans to reason about them.

to present robustness to transformations [26]. In general,
these methods can be divided into two categories: intrinsic
features [3, 5, 33] and extrinsic features [30, 31, 22, 7, 15],
where representative hand-crafed 3D features include spin
image [15], fast point feature histograms (FPFH) [30] and
heat kernel signature (HKS) [33].

With the great success of deep learning methods on 2D
image processing and understanding, pioneer works have
been proposed to design network architectures for 3D point
cloud data [26, 28, 25, 17, 43]. The initial PointNet directly
learns global features from the input point clouds by point-
wise spatial encoding and aggregation, which obtains en-
couraging performance [26]. While PointNet does not cap-
ture local information of point clouds, the extension work
PointNet++ demonstrates the importance of local structure
exploitation [28]. In order to capture local structures, Point-
Net++ designs sampling and grouping layers to obtain lo-
cal sub-clouds, and individually encodes the local regions

1949

by performing point feature embedding on each sub-cloud.
Then, PointNet++ aggregates the local features for holistic
representation with a pooling operation to acquire invari-
ance to point-wise permutations. However, it fails to con-
sider the underlying structural interactions between local re-
gions due to the simple pooling operation, which is one of
the key components in understanding 3D objects.

As examples shown in Figure 1, most real-world 3D ob-
jects have highly related local structures such as repetitive
symmetric regions, continuous surfaces and connected part-
s, and it is a fundamental ability for our humans to reason
about such inner structural relations when analyzing a 3D
object. Structural relational reasoning plays a crucial role in
3D object understanding, especially for the point cloud data
where only the coordinates of points are provided without
further information. For example, if we are learning to rec-
ognize the species of “human” from their 3D shapes, it is far
from satisfactory to individually remember the structures of
all the body parts (head, torso, arms and legs). More im-
portantly, we need to reason about their structural relations,
such as the symmetry of two arms and of two legs, and the
linkage between the torso and other body parts. We may al-
so notice the symmetric two large wings at the ﬁrst glance of
an airplane. These relations are key components when un-
derstanding the holistic 3D structures of humans, airplanes
as well as other objects, and we are able to better grasp the
their semantics with the exploitation of structural relations.
In this paper, we propose a simple module named the
structural relational network (SRN) to reason for the inter-
actions between local regions, which can be plugged into
existing networks without additional labels. Our SRN is in-
spired by the recent relational networks [32, 13, 45]. While
most existing methods model the spatial or temporal rela-
tions for images and videos, SRN aims to capture the struc-
tural interactions between local regions in 3D point clouds.
More speciﬁcally, we compute the geometrical and loca-
tional interactions between each local structure and others
to reason for their relations, so that the learned local features
encode not only the 3D structures but also the dependen-
cies with other local regions. In our experiments, we equip
our SRN with the widely-used PointNet++ architecture [28]
to show the effectiveness, which is also widely applicable
to networks with local structure exploitation modules on
point clouds. Experimental results on the ModelNet [38],
ScanNet [9] and ShapeNet [6] datasets show substantial im-
provements with the 3D point cloud classiﬁcation and seg-
mentation tasks compared to the PointNet++ pipeline.

2. Related Work

Deep Learning on Point Clouds: In recent years, deep
learning methods have been employed to various 2D vi-
sual analysis tasks and have achieved outstanding perfor-
mance [18, 10, 12]. However, these methods cannot be di-

rectly applied to 3D point clouds. While pixels regularly lie
on the image plane for 2D images, the structure of 3D point
cloud data is irregular so that some basic operations in CNN
are not applicable. An intuitive idea to address the issue is to
partition the 3D space into voxelized shapes [23, 38, 27, 9].
However, as 3D point cloud data is usually sparse, these
methods suffer from low resolution and heavy computa-
tional cost. More recently, some deep learning structures
have been especially designed to consume 3D point cloud-
s as the input [26, 28, 25, 29, 39, 19, 20, 14, 2, 44, 40].
For example, Qi et al. [26] proposed a network architecture
named PointNet by fusing point features into global repre-
sentations with max pooling, which presented invariance to
point-wise permutations. As PointNet fails to capture local
structures which play critical roles for the success of con-
volutions, they further extended PointNet to PointNet++ by
hierarchically grouping points to different levels for local
feature extraction [28]. The following works such as self-
organizing network (SO-Net) [19], similarity group propos-
al network (SGPN) [36] and PointCNN [20] also empha-
sized the importance of local structure exploitation for 3D
point clouds. However, they fail to fully exploit the struc-
tural relations between local sub-clouds, which our human-
s largely rely on in 3D object understanding. Instead, the
proposed SRN module aims to reason for such local inter-
actions without any extra supervision signals.

Relational Reasoning: Relational reasoning aims to
reason about the interactions between entities, which is a
fundamental ability of humans. However, such relations
are difﬁcult for conventional network architectures to learn.
More recently, relational modules have been carefully de-
signed to solve the problems [32, 13, 37, 45, 34, 8, 16, 24].
For example, Santoro et al. [32] proposed a relational net-
work (RN) for the task of visual question answering (VQA)
and achieved outstanding performance. Hu et al. [13] pre-
sented an object relation module based on attention mod-
ules for object detection. Zhou et al. [45] designed a tem-
poral relational network (TRN) to reason about the inter-
actions between frames of videos in varying scales. While
most of these methods aim to exploit the spatial or tem-
poral relations in images and videos, very few works fo-
cus on relational reasoning for 3D data. Suwajanakorn et
al. [34] proposed a KeypointNet for category-speciﬁc 3D
keypoint extraction, which is the most relevant work in 3D
point cloud reasoning. Although both methods are designed
for 3D point cloud data, the goal of KeypointNet is to de-
tect latent keypoints by reasoning for the relations between
points and the categories. Our main contribution is the ﬁrst
attempt to reason about the structural relations of 3D object-
s, which are commonly-existed, important, but ignored by
most existing methods. With the exploitation of structural
relations, the models are able to understand 3D objects more
comprehensively.

Figure 2. An illustration of the proposed structural relational network (SRN). For each input point cloud, we ﬁrst obtain local sub-clouds
to extract their geometrical features u and average coordinates v, which are concatenated into local features x. Then, we employ our SRN
to capture the both geometrical and locational relations between the local sub-cloud Pi and other Pj . Lastly, we fuse the two kinds of
relations to obtain the ﬁnal structural relation yi for Pi. In this ﬁgure, we utilize four different colors to represent varying local regions,
and set the red sub-cloud as Pi for an easy illustration. (Best viewed in color.)

3. Proposed Approach

In this section, we ﬁrst present the proposed structural re-
lational network, which can be generally plugged into deep
neural networks on 3D point cloud with local feature ex-
traction modules. Then, we detail how to equip our SRN
module to the widely-used PointNet++ architecture. Last-
ly, we highlight the differences with existing methods and
introduce implementation details.

3.1. Structural Relational Network

Let P be a point set in which each point is represented by
a 3D coordinate feature, where there are local sub-clouds Pi
extracted from the holistic point cloud P . As there are only
coordinates provided for point sets without further informa-
tion, we extract the local geometrical feature ui ∈ Rd and
average location vi ∈ R3 to describe each sub-cloud Pi,
so that the features contain both geometrical and locational
information of each local region.

Inspired by the relational reasoning modules for images
and videos [32, 13, 45], we aim to reason about the struc-
tural relations between each Pi and other Pj . Both geo-
metrical feature u and locational feature v of each local
sub-cloud play crucial roles in structural interactions. For
example, the repetitive local patterns are exploited through
reasoning in geometry, and the linkage relations are cap-
tured through reasoning in location. Therefore, we deﬁne
the structural interactions SRN(xi) between the ith local
sub-cloud and others by jointly learning geometrical and lo-
cational relations:

yi = f 

X

∀j

h (gu (ui, uj) , gv (vi, vj))
 ,

(1)

where both i and j are the indexes of local regions, f , gu,

gv and h are functions, and yi is the learned structural re-
lational feature of Pi. In (1), the pairwise functions gu and
gv aim to exploit the geometrical and locational relations
between Pi and Pj , respectively, and then h fuses the two
kinds of relations followed by an elementwise sum for al-
l Pj . Lastly, we utilize the function f to obtain the ﬁnal
structural relations of Pi.

Figure 1 shows an illustration of the proposed SRN mod-
ule, which aims to learn structural relations between Pi and
other Pj . We learn the geometrical and locational interac-
tions for structural relation exploitation, which are both im-
portant for 3D point cloud understanding. We follow [32]
by ﬁrstly concatenating ui and each uj , and vi and each
vj to construct the input of gu and gv, respectively. The
pairwise functions gu and gv capture the geometrical and
locational relations between Pi and other Pj . Then, we u-
tilize another pairwise function h to fuse the two kinds of
relations for complete description, and sum up the results of
varying Pj up to make (1) invariant to permutations. Lastly,
we employ a function f to obtain the ﬁnal relational rep-
resentation yi. In SRN, we utilize multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) to realize the functions gu and gv, with the param-
eters shared by all local sub-cloud pairs, respectively, and
1 × 1 convolutions for h and f , respectively. The learned
yi provides essential complementary information for local
sub-cloud description. We utilize a residual block to sum up
yi and ui (which share the same dimension), and then con-
catenate vi as the ﬁnal representation of the local sub-cloud
Pi.

There are two key advantages of the proposed SRN mod-

ule:

1) For each local sub-cloud Pi, the SRN module learns
its structural interactions with all the local sub-clouds
Pj . As point sets only contain point-wise coordinates

951

Figure 3. The network architecture of the SRN-equipped PointNet++. We ﬁrst sample and group each input point cloud into G sub-clouds,
following a PointNet module to extrate the local feature u for each sub-cloud. The PointNet module contains a multi-layer perceptron and
a max-pooling layer for feature fusion. Then, we employ the proposed SRN module to obtain the relational features y, which is summed
up by u with a residual connection and concatenated by v. We perform the procedure twice to extract multi-scale local features. Lastly,
we employ a PointNet module to obtain the ﬁnal output feature for the holistic point cloud. (Best viewed in color.)

without further information, SRN simultaneously con-
siders the geometrical and locational relations between
local regions, which both play crucial roles in 3D point
cloud data. Compared with the existing local features
for point clouds, SRN exploits additional information
of structural relations as important complements.

2) SRN supports local sub-clouds in variable numbers
and permutations. Even for the same point cloud, the
number and permutation of local regions may be dif-
ferent due to varying sub-cloud grouping algorithms.
With the shared parameters of the pairwise function g
and the operation of element-wise sum, SRN is ﬂexi-
ble with the input sizes by maintaining the same output
size, and is invariant to varying permutations of local
features.

3.2. SRN PointNet++

The proposed SRN consumes the local geometrical fea-
tures and average coordinates as the input, and learns the
structural relational features as the output. As we simply
employ the concatenation results of local features to replace
the original ones, it can be generally applied to deep neu-
ral network architectures with local feature extraction mod-
ules for point clouds. PointNet++ [28] is a recent network
architecture on 3D point clouds, which has achieved very
promising performance.
In this paper, we employ Point-
Net++ as a representative model to detail the equipment of
SRN and analyze the experimental improvements.

Based on PointNet [26], PointNet++ utilizes an addition-
al hierarchical architecture by sampling and grouping points
for local structure exploitation. Rather than directly learn-

ing a global feature from the holistic point cloud, Point-
Net++ performs iterative farthest point sampling and bal-
l query based grouping to obtain local sub-clouds at ﬁrst,
and then learns local features with PointNet individually.
PointNet++ hierarchically learns local features through the
three key layers including sampling layer, grouping layer
and PointNet layer, and combine the features from multi-
ple scales. Figure 3 shows the network structure of SRN-
equipped PointNet++. Rather than simply utilizing local
features u and v for representation, we learn the relational
features y through SRN to provide essential complements,
which is integrated with the original network with the resid-
ual block. For the point cloud classiﬁcation task, we utilize
the learned holistic feature for representation, and employ a
1024-512-256 fully connected layer followed by a softmax
classiﬁer. For the point cloud segmentation task, we fol-
low [28] by employing a point feature propagation method
to obtain point-wise scores for each point in the original
point cloud.

3.3. Discussion

In this subsection, we compare our SRN with existing re-
lational networks and local feature based methods to high-
light the differences.

Difference with Existing Relational Networks: In re-
cent years, several relational networks (RNs) have been
proposed to reason about the interactions between enti-
ties [32, 13, 45]. They exploit spatial and semantic relations
between objects for images [32, 13], or model temporal re-
lations between frames in videos [45]. In our work, we fo-
cus on the structural relations between local sub-clouds for
3D point sets, which widely exist in real-world 3D object-

952

s and play important roles for our humans to understand
them.
In order to better capture structural relations, we
simultaneously exploit geometrical and locational interac-
tions of sub-clouds, which are both critical in 3D structure
understanding. To our best knowledge, the proposed SRN
is the ﬁrst time to reason about structural relations for point
cloud feature learning.

Difference with Local Feature Based Methods: Re-
cent deep learning methods on 3D point cloud data demon-
strate the importance of local regions [28, 39, 20]. In gener-
al, these methods employ hierarchical architectures to cap-
ture local structures in varying scales, and then integrate
the local features for holistic representation. However, they
independently process each local region and ignore the im-
portant structural relations thereby cannot completely un-
derstand the holistic 3D objects. Instead, our SRN captures
both geometrical and positional relations to provide essen-
tial complement information for 3D local structure descrip-
tion, which is able to boost the performance of the existing
network architecture for point clouds as a simple plug-and-
play module.

3.4. Implementation Details

We used the Tensorﬂow [1] packages to construct our
module throughout the experiments. For each 3D point
cloud input, we randomly sampled 1,024 points from the
3D mesh to construct the point sets. The dimensions and
other details of each layer are shown in Figure 3.
In the
ﬁrst SRN module, we reasoned about the structural rela-
tions between each local region and the randomly-selected
32 local regions. In the second SRN module, we reason for
all the sub-clouds for each sub-cloud. We did not perform
data augmentation of point clouds, and ﬁxed the dimension
of the ﬁnal representation as 1,024. We set the maximum
training epoch number as 250 and the batchsize as 16 in the
experiments. At the beginning of training, we empirically
set the learning rate as 0.001 and the decay rate as 0.7 for
every 200K steps.

4. Experiments

We conducted experiments on the widely-used 3D point
cloud datasets to evaluate the proposed SRN module. More
speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst tested the performance of the SRN-
equipped PointNet++ on point cloud classiﬁcation and seg-
mentation tasks, respectively, and compared with the state-
of-the-art methods. We also designed cross-dataset evalua-
tion to test the generalization ability. Then, we illustrated
the effectiveness of SRN with ablation studies. Lastly, we
visualized the t-SNE results and the learned structural re-
lations between local sub-clouds for intuitive illustrations,
and analyzed the key observations from the experiments.
For fair comparisons, we utilized the same network struc-
ture of PointNet++ with our SRN-PointNet++ on all the

modules.

4.1. Datasets

We employed three benchmark point cloud datasets for
experimental evaluation, which included ModelNet40 [38],
ScanNet [9] and ShapeNet [6]. We followed the standard
evaluation protocols to test the performance.

1) The ModelNet40 dataset [38] contains 40 categories
with 12,331 3D mesh models, which are split into
9,843 training models and 2,468 test models.

2) The ScanNet dataset [9] includes 1,513 scanned and
reconstructed indoor scenes, and we employ 1,201
scenes as the training set and the rest 312 scenes as
the test set.

3) The ShapeNet dataset [6] covers 55 common objec-
t categories with about 51,300 models, where we fol-
low [41] by employing the ShapeNet Part dataset of
16 categories with 16,880 models. The models are di-
vided into 14,006 training split and 2,874 test split, in
which each point is associated with a point-wise label
for the point cloud segmentation task.

4.2. Quantitative Results

In this subsection, we ﬁrst evaluated the proposed SRN-
PointNet++ on point cloud classiﬁcation and segmentation
tasks, respectively, and designed cross-dataset experiments.
Then, we conducted ablation studies for more in-depth anal-
ysis of SRN.

the deep model, and the methods often perform well on oth-
er tasks if they achieve promising classiﬁcation accuracies.
We compared our SRN-PointNet++ with the state-of-the-art
methods on the ModelNet40 [38] and ScanNet [9] datasets
following the standard evaluation protocols.

Table 1 shows the classiﬁcation results compared with
the existing methods, where we share the same network
architecture and hyperparameters of PointNet++ [28] and
our SRN-PointNet++ for direct comparisons. We utilize the
bold numbers to show that the performance of PointNet++
is improved equipped with SRN. In general, the point cloud
data in ScanNet is more complicated than ModelNet40, as
ScanNet contains indoor scenes and ModelNet40 includes
3D objects. While PointNet++ captures multi-scale local
structures with hierarchical layers, it integrates local fea-
tures with a simple max-pooling operation and fails to ex-
ploit their structural relations.
Instead, the proposed S-
RN module explicitly reasons about the geometrical and
locational relations of local structures, so that the learned
deep model better understands the holistic structure of point
clouds. The simple plug-and-play SRN module successful-
ly boosts the performance of PointNet++ on both Model-
Net40 and ScanNet datasets. More spciﬁcally, we observe
that the improvement for ScanNet is larger than ModelNet
equipped with our SRN module. As the point clouds in
ScanNet are more complicated with adaquate local struc-
tures, reasoning about the inner structural relations plays a
more important role for more complete understanding. F-
PNN [21], Vol. CNN [27] and O-CNN [35] are volume-

based deep learning methods which suffer from low reso-
lution of 3D point cloud data. Our SRN-PointNet++ di-
rectly consumes point sets as inputs and outperforms these
methods. PointCNN [20] designs a X -convolution opera-
tion on 3D point cloud and achieves the state-of-the-art per-
formance.
Instead, the proposed SRN-PointNet++ model
is able to obtain a comparable result on ModelNet40 and
better performance on more complicated ScanNet by rea-
soning about the structural relations between local regions,
where only multi-layer perceptrons and 1 × 1 convolutions
are utilized for mapping rather than carefully-designed X -
convolution operation on 3D point cloud data.

As there are large differences between the point cloud
data in ModelNet40 (3D objects) and ScanNet (indoor
scenes), we also conducted cross-dataset experiments to test
the generalization ability of the proposed SRN-PointNet++.
For cross-dataset evaluation, we trained the network on one
dataset and tested on the other dataset, extracting features
with the learned model and employing linear SVM as classi-
ﬁer. Table 2 shows the experimental results of cross-dataset
experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanNet. We observe that
the performance drops if we chooses different training and
test datasets due to the data discrepancy. However, the gap-
s are small and the cross-dataset experimental results are
still comparable with existing recent methods. The cross-
dataset experiments demonstrate the generalization abili-
ty of our SRN-PointNet++. Moreover, it shows that the
learned structural relations are common for varying types
of 3D point cloud data.

Point Cloud Segmentation: The segmentation task
is more challenging than classiﬁcation as it requires fur-
ther understanding of the point cloud data. We used the
ShapeNet Part dataset [6] for comparison with existing
methods on the point cloud segmentation task. We fol-
lowed [42, 29] by employing part averaged IoU to evaluate
the segmentation results, which calculated the weighted av-
erage of IoU for each category. Through the detailed com-
parisons on each 3D object, we are able to make complete
observations of the proposed SRN-PointNet++.

Table 3 illustrates the experimental comparisons of point
cloud segmentation on the ShapeNet Part dataset, where
we also employ bold numbers to represent the improve-
ment of SRN. Among the compared baseline methods,
SyncSpecCNN [42] [11] is especially designed for the
task of 3D semantic segmentation, while other method-
s are general 3D feature learning methods. We observe
that the proposed SRN-PointNet++ obtains the state-of-the-
art performance in the ﬁnal result compared with exist-
ing methods on the task of point cloud segmentation. E-
quipped with our SRN module, SRN-PointNet++ outper-
forms PointNet++ in 13 out of 16 identities, which demon-
strates the effectiveness of structural relational reasoning
for 3D point cloud understanding. While SyncSpecCN-
N [42] learns synchronized spectral CNN for 3D data aug-
mentation, SRN-PointNet++ achieves better performance
on the point cloud segmentation task as a general point
cloud analysis method. FCPN [29] is the most recent deep
learning method for point clouds, which designs a fully-
convolutional point network to process large-scale 3D da-
ta. Instead, our SRN-PointNet++ outperforms FCPN in the
ﬁnal result with the exploitation of structural relations by
simple operations. Experimental results show the effective-
ness of SRN-PointNet++ on the relatively hard point cloud
segmentation task.

Ablation Study: Besides direct comparisons with the
recent methods on benchmark datasets, we also conducted
ablation experiments on ModelNet40 to further analyze the
properties of SRN. In order to completely exploit structural

relations between local regions, we simultaneously consid-
ered geometrical and locational interactions and we tested
the inﬂuence of the relation types by only using each one
of them. Moreover, we employed a residual block to aggre-
gate local structural features and relations features in SRN-
PointNet++, which we compared with another widely-used
fusion method of concatenation.

Table 4 shows the classiﬁcation accuracies on Model-
Net40 of the ablation study. In the table, Geo and Loc are
geometrical and locational relations, respectively. We com-
pared the performance of SRN-PointNet++ by exploiting
each or both of them. Concat and Res represent to fuse
the structural features with concatenation ([y, u, v]) and
residual blocks ([y + u, v]). We observe that capturing ei-
ther geometrical or locational relation is able to boost the
performance of PointNet++, which is close to our human-
s when understanding 3D objects as we may notice both
repetitive structures and linkages of parts. The best perfor-
mance is obtained by simultaneously considering both rela-
tions. Concatenation and residual blocks are popular meth-
ods for feature combination. Through the detailed compar-
isons, we observe that the performance gap is small for the
two aggregation approaches, which shows the adaptivity of
the learned relational features. As the residual blocks do not
require to increase the feature length, we employ residual
blocks throughout the experiments for computational cost
reduction.

4.3. Qualitative Results

In this subsection, we ﬁrst visualized the t-SNE results
of the proposed SRN-PointNet++. Figure 4 shows the vi-
sualization results. We observe that most classes are sepa-
rated with small intra-class variations, which demonstrates
the discriminative power of SRN-PointNet++. For more de-
tailed analysis, we look into the most mixed areas to ﬁnd
the categories which have larger difﬁculties to be correct-
ly classiﬁed. We discover that the most confusing cate-

1) The proposed SRN module successfully boosts the
performance of PointNet++ on both classiﬁcation and
segmentation tasks, which shows the effectiveness of
structural relational reasoning in 3D point cloud da-
ta. Moreover, the improvement is more signiﬁcant
for complicated point cloud data with adequate local
structures.

2) Cross-dataset evaluations on ModelNet40 and Scan-
Net show that our SRN-PointNet++ presents strong
generalization ability and captures common structural
relations despite of data discrepancy.

3) Ablation studies show that both geometrical and lo-
cational interactions are important to describe struc-
tural relations between local regions. The best result
is achieved when simultaneously exploiting both rela-
tions. Also, we show that different aggregation meth-
ods of the local structural features and relational fea-
tures do not largely affect the performance of SRN-
PointNet++.

4) While supervision signals only provide the categories
of the point clouds, visualization results illustrate that
our SRN module is able to capture highly relevant local
structures without speciﬁc labels.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a simple and plug-and-
play module named SRN to reason about structural relation-
s between local regions for 3D point clouds, which play an
important role for our humans to analyze 3D objects. While
most existing methods aggregate local features by a simple
pooling operation thereby ignoring the important structural
interactions, our SRN explicitly captures their geometri-
cal and locational relations to better understand the holistic
structures. The proposed SRN module can be equipped with
the existing models, where we detail the SRN-PointNet++
architecture as a representative method. Experimental re-
sults on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SRN suc-
cessfully boosts the performance of the original network on
point cloud classiﬁcation and segmentation tasks. Ablation
studies and visualization results also show that our SRN
module captures essential structural relations in geometry
and location.

gories for SRN-PointNet++ are: 1) night stand, 2) dresser,
3) wardrobe, and 4) x-box. These objects share similar 3D
structures, which are also relatively simple compared with
other classes such as airplane and car. On one hand, their
inter-class distances are small which leads to large difﬁculty
in feature learning and classiﬁcation. On the other hand, our
SRN module captures similar structural relations for these
objects and results in similar encoding due to their simple
and regular structures. Therefore, these classes are relative-
ly easier to be misclassiﬁed by SRN-PointNet++ compared
with other classes.

We also visualized the learned structural relations with
the high responses of the second SRN in our SRN-
PointNet++. Figure 5 shows the visualization results on the
ModelNet40 dataset. We observe that highly related local
structures are captured with both geometrical and location-
al interactions, such as symmetric repetitive parts (the ﬁrst
row), local regions sharing the same plane (the second row)
and essential linkages of varying parts (the third row). Al-
though the point clouds from different classes vary largely,
our SRN module is still able to exploit the common and
underlying relations between local structures. It should be
noted that we do not utilize additional labels or carefully-
designed loss functions to train such structural relations. In-
stead, these relations are captured with the goal of better un-
derstanding the semantics. In other words, SRN discovers
similar local interactions with our humans when learning to
understand the objects, which also demonstrates the impor-
tance of exploiting structural relations in 3D object analysis.
