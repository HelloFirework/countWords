Abstract

We formulate an equation describing a general Non-
line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging measurement and analyze the
properties of the measurement in the Fourier domain re-
garding the spatial frequencies of the scene it encodes. We
conclude that for a relay wall with ﬁnite size, certain scene
conﬁgurations and features are not detectable in an NLOS
measurement. We then provide experimental examples of
invisible scene features and their reconstructions, as well
as a set of example scenes that lead to an ill-posed NLOS
imaging problem.

1. Introduction

Time of ﬂight non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging uses
fast illumination sources and detectors to probe multi-
bounce light transport of scenes not directly visible to the
observer (Figure 2). An illumination source illuminates
points pi on a relay surface with short pulses and captures
light returning from the scene to points pd on the relay
wall. By solving the inverse light transport problem from
those NLOS measurements, the invisible 3D space can be
reconstructed. We refer to this type of time of ﬂight (time-
resolved) NLOS measurement simply as NLOS measure-
ment.

Different inverse methods have been developed to recon-
struct hidden scenes from the time of ﬂight data such as ﬁl-
tered backprojection [18, 7, 3, 10], similar to backprojection
methods used in computed tomography problems. Other
methods formulate the light transport in the hidden scene
as a linear matrix operator and solve a matrix inverse prob-
lem to reconstruct the scene through an optimization frame-
work [9]. More recently, O’Toole et al. showed that for con-
focal datasets (see Fig. 2 a; on the other hand, b shows the
non-confocal NLOS measurement) the forward integral can
be simpliﬁed to a convolution operator. Thus the inverse
process can be expressed as a deconvolution problem and
solved efﬁciently [13]. Other methods perform the recon-
struction using subsets of the measurement data such as the

ﬁrst returned photon [16], or parameterizing the reconstruc-
tion as a set of planes [14]. Other reconstruction techniques
are described in [19, 17]. Some existing approaches even
model partial occlusions within the hidden scene, e.g., [8].
The ﬁndings about reconstruction techniques developed for
NLOS imaging have also been transferred to acoustic imag-
ing around corners [11].

In this work, we aim to provide a generic description
for direct bounce (3rd bounce) NLOS measurements and
show how much information they encode and how this af-
fects practical NLOS imaging problems.

Consider the NLOS reconstruction shown in Figure 1. It
contains three very similar patches that only vary slightly
in orientation and have different positions in the reconstruc-
tion space. Yet while two of the patches are reconstructed

clearly and accurately, the third is completely missing from
the reconstruction. A closer inspection of prior published
results reveals that similar artifacts are seen in reconstruc-
tions using a variety of diverse reconstruction methods. Sur-
faces with certain normal vectors are missing in the recon-
struction or scenes with simple surfaces are chosen to avoid
the problem. The main purpose of this work is to explain
this phenomenon.

As we show below, any NLOS measurement can be ex-
pressed as an integral operator known in the literature as el-
liptical Radon integral. We analyze this measurement func-
tion in the Fourier domain and show that a signiﬁcant part of
the measurement space is not accessed by the NLOS mea-
surement and thus represents a null space for NLOS recon-
struction. Finally, we investigate the Fourier domain repre-
sentations of common scenes and scene features to identify
features that fall into the null space and cannot be recon-
structed. Because our analysis involves a generic descrip-
tion of the NLOS measurement, it is independent of the re-
construction algorithm used. We expect our ﬁndings will
inform inverse solution design and future NLOS reconstruc-
tion methods.

2. Related Work

Statements of the properties of NLOS reconstructions
are sometimes included with a presentation of reconstruc-
tion algorithms. For example, the available resolution has
been analyzed [3, 13]. Since the underlying mathemati-
cal forward model shares a similar root as the computed
tomography problem (Radon integral), much more exten-
sive work on this problem is available through related prob-
lems. Radon integrals have been studied for their applica-
tions in ultrasound imaging and medical computed tomo-
graphies [20, 15, 12]. The effect of a ﬁnite-sized sampling
aperture is similar to the missing cones problem that has
been the subject of extensive research in medical computed
tomography (CT) imaging [5, 1].

Radon integrals can be categorized into classical Radon
integral (planar), spherical Radon transform (SRT) and
elliptical (ellipsoid) Radon transform (ERT). The planar
Radon transform with its high dimensional model [4] is
well known in the CT ﬁeld. The spherical Radon trans-
form (SRT) with its inverse solution design can be found
in [20, 15]. A similar inverse formula for the confocal mea-
surement setup applies for the SRT model used in ultra-
sound [15] and NLOS imaging [13]. The elliptical Radon
transform (ERT) has been studied by Moon et al. [12]. An
inverse to the ERT was proposed in [6] and is similar to (but
not the same as) the NLOS non-confocal ﬁltered backpro-
jection method [18, 7, 3].

3. Contributions

Our contributions in this work are as follows:

• We formulate a generic measurement equation for time
of ﬂight NLOS imaging with limited visible wall size
and analyze the information sampled by the NLOS
capturing process in the spatial frequency domain.
This allows us to make statements about visible and
invisible features in the measurement space that are
independent of all linear deterministic reconstruction
methods.

• Based on our model, we analyze some commonly used
scene features resulting in a simple rule to predict fea-
ture visibility for NLOS imaging.

• We conﬁrm our conclusion with experimental data.

• To further demonstrate the nature of the missing
data, we also provide an exemplary challenge scene.
Scenes like these lead to identical NLOS measurement
datasets despite having different scene geometries.

4. NLOS imaging problem

In this section, we are going to provide basic mathemati-
cal tools for modeling the NLOS imaging problem in a gen-
eral way by introducing the NLOS measurement function
and its properties. Then we introduce the concept of lim-
ited aperture NLOS imaging which results in an incomplete
measurement space. This incomplete measurement space is
essential for the next section dealing with our measurement
analysis in the spatial Fourier domain in Sec. 5.

4.1. NLOS Measurement Function

The NLOS measurement scenarios are illustrated in Fig-
ure 2 on the left, and two measurement setups are shown
in the subﬁgures a and b. In an NLOS measurement, the
scene is illuminated from a point pi (illumination position)
and light returning from the scene is recorded at a detection
point pd (detection position) after a certain time interval t.
Both pi and pd are within the ﬁnite area of the relay wall
that we call the NLOS sampling aperture. In practice, this
sampling aperture is bounded by the limited ﬁeld of view
because of the remote detection.

We use f (p) to represent the unknown 3D scene we
would like to recover. Here f (p) is a function of the vector
p = (x, y, z) storing the reﬂectance values in space. We
assume uniform scattering, thus the reﬂectance value is an-
gle independent. The function g represents one single time
response measurement at illumination position pi and de-
tection position pd. Thus, each time resolved measurement
g(pi, pd, t) is a function of illumination position pi, detec-
tion position pd and time t. The NLOS measurement is
made up of a set of detection positions (detection grid) from

case) or ellipse (non-confocal case).

a single or multiple subsequent point illuminations on the
wall. We use G = {g1, g2, g3, ..., gn} to represent all mea-
surements. We focus on illustrating the transformation from
f (p) to one single measurement g(pi, pd, t) ﬁrst. Then it is
straightforward to understand the transformation from f (p)
to the entire measurement set G. Subﬁgures a and b of Fig-
ure 2 represent the confocal and non-confocal measurement
setups. Since the non-confocal case is the more general ver-
sion of NLOS measurement, we start our forward modeling
from the non-confocal measurement.

We can use an integral operator A : f (p) → g(pi, pd, t)
to represent the linear transform from the unknown function
f (p) to a temporal measurement at given detection and illu-
mination positions and time g(pi, pd, t). This results in the
NLOS measurement equation:

g(pi, pd, t) = ZR3

Υ(di, dd) · δ(di + dd − t · c) · f (p) dp .

(1)

In the literature, this integral is ofter referred to as the El-
liptical Radon Transform (ERT). The delta function kernel
in this equation describes the geometry of the integration,
and c denotes the speed of light. To simplify notation, we
use the distance terms di = |p − pi| and dd = |p − pd|
which represent the distances between the integral variable
p and illumination/detection position, respectively. The
term Υ(di, dd) stands for the intensity drop-off associated
with distances traveled by the light. This intensity term
is normally not included in the ERT, however we add it in
this treatment as it is needed to correctly model the physical
measurement process. The integration (1) can be performed
for an entire family of thin ellipsoid surfaces having differ-
ent foci pi and pd.

Any set of NLOS measurements made from locations
within the NLOS aperture area can be expressed as a set of
these measurement functions. The integral in Equation (1)
is difﬁcult to treat analytically because of non-constant cur-

vatures. Therefore we also consider two simpliﬁed scenar-
ios. If we allow only measurements where pi = pd, we
obtain the confocal NLOS measurement (Figure 2 a)

g(pi, pi, t) = ZR3

Υ(di) · δ(2 · di − t · c) · f (p) dp .

(2)

This integral without intensity term Υ(di) is also known in
the literature as the spherical Radon transform (SRT) [20,
15].

Another useful tool to approximate the measurement
function is to locally replace the elliptical integral by in-
tegrals over planes that are tangential to the ellipsoids. This
refers to a zoom-in version of the integration at a local vol-
ume. Since the integral is a linear operator, the measure-
ment can be represented as superposition of all individual
inputs (linearity). Then for each individual input, the local
integral version can be approximated by the planar integral.
This means:

We linearize the unknown 3D function f (p) by a sum-
mation of local functions f1, f2, ..., fn which store the fea-
tures representing the 3D image. Each local function repre-
sents a local pattern within cube volumes at different posi-
tions such that each subspace contains only small sections
of the ellipsoids. Each ellipsoid g(pi, pi, t) can within that
subspace be approximated by planes g′(t, θ, φ) where the
planar angles θ and φ are such that the plane normal vec-
tor points to the center of the ellipsoid and t is proportional
to twice the distance between the ellipsoid center and the
plane. In polar coordinates, this yields

δ(sin θ cos φx + sin θ sin φy + cos θz − t · c) dx dy dz .

This planar approximation has been described before in
[18, 7] to approximate the NLOS imaging result from non-
confocal streak camera measurements. It is also similar in

10142

nature to the approximation made when using a piecewise
deﬁnition of a locally varying point spread function as is of-
ten done in point spread function deconvolution problems.

Above all, we provide the basic tools for describing the
NLOS forward model which we are going to use in Sec-
tion 5. There, we provide our main tools to analyze the
incomplete measurement space effect. Our idea is to mimic
the imaging system by illustrating the information content
in the Fourier domain by the modulation transfer function
(MTF) dependent on a given limited aperture.

5. NLOS Measurements in the Fourier domain

A complete description of a measurement of a section
of f (p) can be described as the set of all g(pi, pd, t) for
which pi and pd are in the NLOS aperture plane and t is
such that the measurement ellipsoid goes through f (p). To
obtain insight into the patterns in the scene that are sam-
pled by this measurement, we want to analyze them in the
Fourier domain. The Fourier domain NLOS measurement
function can be understood as a Modulation Transfer Func-
tion (MTF) of NLOS imaging.

For the planar Radon transform (PRT, Equation (3)), the
Fourier transform of g′ can be computed analytically using
the projection-slice theorem.

5.1. Projection slice theorem

The projection slice theorem (PST) is well-known and
widely used in the area of computed tomography and other
ﬁelds. We will give a short explanation of the 2D version
here; the 3D version is shown in the supplemental docu-
ment. The PST provides an elegant tool for using projec-
tions (i.e., integrals) along parallel lines of an unknown 2D
scene: it shows that the 1D Fourier transform of such pro-
jections actually represents one line through the origin of
the 2D Fourier spectrum of the unknown scene. Repeat-
ing the process for different projection angles provides the
missing lines; scene reconstruction is then easily achieved
by inverse 2D FT.

The unknown 2D function is denoted by f (x, y). Let us
ﬁrst assume that the projection angle θ is zero. The pro-
jection dependent on the displacement u with respect to the
origin and vertically to the projection direction is then given
by [2]

fproj(u, θ = 0) = ZZ f (x, y)δ(x − u)dxdy

= Z f (u, y)dy .

Performing the 1D Fourier transform with respect to u

yields

.

(4)

Fu{fproj(u, 0)} = ZZ f (u, y)e−j2πfuududy
= ZZ f (x, y)e−j2πfxxdxdy
= ZZ f (x, y)e−j2π(fxx+fy y)dxdy(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)fy=0

This corresponds to the 2D Fourier transform of the un-
known function f (x, y) at the line with fy = 0. Repeating
the projection with different angles θ results in the corre-
sponding line of the 2D Fourier transform; note that rotation
in the spatial domain corresponds to a rotation by the same
angle in the frequency domain. By considering all angles θ
from 0 to 2π and adding all Fourier spectrum lines, the full
function f (x, y) can then be reconstructed by inverse 2D
Fourier transform. It is advisable to apply a high pass ﬁlter
before the inverse Fourier transform, as high frequencies
are underrepresented because of the spectral lines meeting
in the origin, but diverging for higher frequencies, which
means that there is less information available for these fre-
quencies. This is called ﬁltered backprojection [4].

In the 3D case, the projection along parallel planes and
subsequent 1D Fourier transform of the calculated (scalar)
projection values for each plane provides one line of the
3D spectrum of f (p). Rotating the projection planes about
the origin provides the spectrum along all lines through the
origin. See the supplementary document for details.

5.2. Local Fourier cone

The left part of Figure 5 shows the measurement for two
cases where the illumination and detection points are co-
located at a or b at either side of the relay wall. In the middle
of that ﬁgure, we can see that the collected time response for
those two cases are projections along directions with angles
Θ1 or Θ2 with respect to the relay wall. The exact projec-
tions are performed along ellipsoids; however, we approxi-
mate these as planes. As it is shown on the right of Figure
5, the Fourier slice theorem states that the 1D Fourier trans-
form of the projections of the scene along parallel planes at
angle Θ in the primal domain is equal to a slice at angle Θ
in the 2D Fourier spectrum of the scene. To create a cone
we then simply draw the corresponding lines for all acces-
sible points on the relay wall. By using a limited size relay
wall, the black part of the spectrum is not contained in any
measurements.

Null space and cone variation: As shown in Fig. 3,
given the same size of the limited aperture, the closer the
considered volume is to the sampling aperture, the larger
the visible angle range of this cone is (compared with po-
sition 1 and position 4 in Fig. 3). Moreover, offset with
regard to the center of the aperture also tilts this sampling

Rotating of the features simply corresponds to rotating by the same angle in the Fourier domain. The patterns are (top left to bottom right)

in the discrete model, we can see from Fig. 3 that the lo-
cal planar model gives a good boundary estimation for the
confocal and non-confocal cases. Notice that we ﬁxed one
focus pi in the non-confocal case resulting in a more nar-
row MTF pattern. By moving the non-confocal illumination
spot, this narrow cone slightly rotates which could achieve
a similar angle coverage in the confocal measurement.

cone in the Fourier domain (refer to positions 2, 3 and 5 in
Figure 3). Overall, things outside this cone will never be
sampled in the Fourier domain by the limited aperture un-
less the aperture size is increased. This means that, e.g., a
wall placed perpendicularly to the relay wall has a Fourier
transform which, apart from the DC value at frequency 0,
will fully vanish in the missing cone and cannot be seen in
any reconstruction not accounting for the missing cone.

Model validity: To verify the model validity, we per-
form a computation for planar, confocal and non-confocal

Local scene features: To use the proposed analysis, we
need to decompose any complicated NLOS imaging scenes
into simple features such as planes etc. This is shown in
Fig. 4, which also displays their Fourier spectra which de-
ﬁnes their reconstructability, cf. Fig. 5 and the following
paragraph. Most of the simple features can be represented
as a thin surface with different roughness level as well as
edge like discontinuity patterns and curvatures. Rotation of
the patterns in space simply corresponds to the same rota-
tion in the Fourier domain.

MTF with scene features: To assess visibility of the

10144

Limited WallLocal WindowxyΘ1xyΘ2fxfyΘ1Θ2Frequency Domaintt𝑎𝑏targets we have to consider the overlap between the target
spectra and the MTF sampling cone. This will be shown
illustratively in the results, see Section 6.2. Note that the
most valuable information is encoded in the high frequency
components of the cone. The center of the cone is at the
origin and thus samples the low spatial frequencies. The
high frequency components far away from the origin are
necessary to create high resolution reconstructions.

Limited aperture ill-posed example: Limited aperture
NLOS imaging with arbitrary targets should be viewed as
an ill-posed problem. Consider a simple patch with dif-
ferent rotation angles with respect to the limited aperture.
Once it is facing the sampling aperture and located at its
center, its local Fourier spectrum is optimally covered by
the MTF Fourier cone. However, when the patch pattern
rotates, its Fourier pattern also rotates by the same angle.
Once it rotates outside the angle covered by each local
cone, the recorded information only includes the origin in
the Fourier plane, corresponding to a constant or zero spa-
tial frequency. See the experiments in Sec. 6.2 for an il-
lustration of this effect. Overall, this means we can still
see that a structure is there (after all, there is light com-
ing back) but we cannot actually uniquely reconstruct it.
On the other hand, a local pattern containing high spatial
frequency contents like edges or surface roughness has a
much broader spectrum and at least part of it always over-
laps with the measurement cone making it at least partially
reconstructible.

Rule-of-thumb criterion: From this, we can also derive
a simple rule for visibility of scene patches. Since a planar
scene segment is represented by a line through the origin
in the Fourier domain, the segment will be completely vis-
ible if the line lies within the sampled cone, and invisible
if it is at an angle outside the cone. In the primal domain
this means that a segment is only visible when its normal
vector points toward the relay wall.

Overall, for NLOS imaging scenarios, more higher spa-
tial frequency components of unknown targets subsequently
result in more ﬂuctuations in the temporal measurements.
For this reason, they lead to a higher chance to actually see
the target by using all deterministic linear inverse solutions
from a limited aperture.

6.1. Completely invisible feature example

To provide further evidence for the existence of a uni-
versal, reconstruction independent null-space, we provide a
set of example scenes that are simple enough to be treated
analytically for a confocal measurement set. To do this, we
replace f (p) by speciﬁc functions to represent the scene
features inside the integral measurement equations (1) and
(2). To simplify the calculation, we consider only a two
dimensional scenario of a confocal NLOS measurement.

shown in Figure 6, the unknown target is a smooth wall at
an angle to the relay wall described by δ(cos(θ)x−sin(θ)y)
for y ≥ 0. For confocal NLOS measurements, our illumina-
tion and detection are co-located at the x-axis meaning that
pi = pd = (x0, 0), x0 ≥ 0. Since the distance correction
simply ampliﬁes the signal at each given time index i, we
use the notation C(i) to represent this correction term. We
use the term g(i) to represent the reﬂectance integration at
each time index i. By plugging this special function into the
Radon integral, we obtain the following equation:

g(i) = C(i) ·Z ∞

By performing the distance correction C(i) to account for
the distortion from the intensity drop off, the measurement
g(i) simply represents a set of reﬂectance integrals in the
unknown space.

Using the fact that δ(cos(θ)x − sin(θ)y) is only 1 for
cos(θ)x = sin(θ)y, we can replace x by y tan(θ) and fur-
ther simplify the equation by getting rid of integral variable

surement can be viewed as a sum of 1 or 0 at any given
time index ˆi when the kernel inside the integral (tan(θ)y −
x0)2 + y2 − ( c·ˆi
2 )2 = 0. This parabolic equation may have
zero, one or two solutions with ﬁxed θ, x0. This means the
ﬁnal measurement g may be 0, 1 or 2 at any given time in-
dex. A simple observation is that, once the wall reaches
angle θ = π/2, the value of the integral is the same for
all pi = (x0, 0), x0 ≥ 0 on the aperture line. The signal
g with different wall rotation angles is shown in Figure 6.
Thus, all scenes with walls at angles above θ = π/2 re-
sult in the same NLOS data and are thus not distinguishable
without any prior constraints. Extending this treatment to a
3D space results in more complex equations and is therefore
less instructive. It is subject of further study.

6.2. Experiments

We perform two experiments of ill-posed scenarios
which are ﬁrst predicted by our proposed local cone model.
For the reconstruction process, we choose a ﬁltered back-
projection [18, 7, 3] without thresholding process. For vi-
sualization, we choose the maximum projection along the
depth dimension in the front view. Also, we provide a max-
imum projection for the bird view.

In Figure 7 we show a rotating letter S and planar patch
example. As shown in the result, the simple patch pattern
is completely resolvable when facing directly to the limited
aperture. In this situation all patch normals are pointing at
the relay wall aperture. As the targets rotate, normals start
pointing past the aperture and the planes start to disappear.
Not all target patches disappear simultaneously due to the
local variations in Fourier cone discussed above. Eventu-
ally, all patch normals point outside the aperture and the

entire targets are outside the Fourier cone. We can only re-
solve the high spatial frequency pattern at edges in the ﬁnal
reconstruction.

Another three patches example was already shown in
Figure 1. Having now the theoretical tools at hand, we see
in Fig. 8 that both patches a and c have the same magnitude
spectrum, but because of the spatially dependent measure-
ment cone, only the offset of patch c is captured.
In the
reconstruction, this patch is therefore almost entirely invis-
ible.

7. Discussion and Conclusion

Using a limited aperture NLOS sampling measurement
and a simple patch target, the following statements can
be made based on our presented model for non-resolvable
scene features.

• Consider a patch that is directly facing to and located
inside the sampling aperture window. The closer it is
to the sampling wall, the more resolvable it becomes
and the reconstruction quality increases.

• Target surfaces offset or rotated in the unknown vol-
ume are only visible if their normal vector points to
the relay wall aperture.

• While it is not possible to reconstruct missing patches,
we can detect if missing patches exist as they still re-
ﬂect light.

• When comparing reconstruction quality among differ-
ent inverse methods, it is important to be aware of
how much information is available in the measurement

Figure 8. Explanation of the missing feature in Fig. 1 The mea-
surement cone is shown as gray area and illustrates the part of
the Fourier spectrum that is actually acquired by NLOS measure-
ments.
It varies with the position in the 3D space that is to be
reconstructed. Both patches a and c of the scene are oriented the
same way; the spatial shift just corresponds to a phase shift in the
Fourier domain, but not in a change of the magnitude spectrum.
This means both patches have the same magnitude spectrum, but
due to the fact that the measurement cone is different at their re-
spective positions, the measurement of patch c only captures the
offset and not the rest of the spectrum. For this reason, this patch
cannot be reconstructed.

specify the sampling aperture/target location as well as
sampling aperture size.

Our statements apply to any NLOS measurement that in-
volves only the direct (3rd bounce) light from the hidden
scene. Missing features may be reconstructed by algorithms
by making use of higher order bounces, or missing informa-
tion may be ﬁlled in using priors. This hole ﬁlling solution
is different from deblurring and de-noising tasks common
in imaging. The modulation transfer functions we derive
are zero outside the Fourier cone (as opposed to just being
very small like a Gaussian). This means deblurring methods
based on deconvolution will fail, even for noiseless data.

The limited aperture NLOS scenario is essential to be un-
derstood for future inverse method design. All the determin-
istic linear inverse methods can only recover the scene fea-
tures which are contained in the limited measurement space.
Overall, based on our local MTF sampling cone model, it is
easy to see this limited aperture problem. By allowing any
targets around the corner, some scene features may not be

well represented, or completely missing in the incomplete
measurement space. Future inverse method design should
go beyond deterministic inverse methods by adding prior
constraints to the inverse model to speciﬁcally account for
this ill-posed limited aperture problem.

In this work we provide only an approximate analyti-
cal model that we back up with numerical computations of
the exact functions. An exact analytical expression for the
Fourier cone is subject of further research.
