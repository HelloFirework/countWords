Abstract

This paper proposes the novel task of video generation
conditioned on a SINGLE semantic label map, which pro-
vides a good balance between ﬂexibility and quality in the
generation process. Different from typical end-to-end ap-
proaches, which model both scene content and dynamics in
a single step, we propose to decompose this difﬁcult task into
two sub-problems. As current image generation methods do
better than video generation in terms of detail, we synthe-
size high quality content by only generating the ﬁrst frame.
Then we animate the scene based on its semantic meaning to
obtain temporally coherent video, giving us excellent results
overall. We employ a cVAE for predicting optical ﬂow as
a beneﬁcial intermediate step to generate a video sequence
conditioned on the initial single frame. A semantic label map
is integrated into the ﬂow prediction module to achieve ma-
jor improvements in the image-to-video generation process.
Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset show that
our method outperforms all competing methods. The source
code will be released on https://github.com/junting/seg2vid.

1. Introduction

A typical visual scene is composed of foreground objects
and the background. In a dynamic scene, motion of the
background is determined by camera movement which is
independent of the motion of foreground objects. Scene
understanding, which include both understanding how fore-
ground objects and background look and how they change, is
essential to advancing the development of computer vision.
Scene understanding, besides using recognition models, can
be accomplished by generative methods[34]. In this work we
focus on using generative models to understand our visual
world.

There has been much progress in image generation to
address static scene modeling. Researchers have proposed
methods to generate images from only noise [10] or from pre-

deﬁned conditions such as attribute, text and pose [41, 20]. In
recent works, people also pay attention to image generation
conditioned on semantic information with either paired [12]
or unpaired data [42]. The conditional image generation
methods provide a way to manipulate existing images and
have potential value as a data augmentation strategy to assist
other computer vision tasks. While image generation tasks
only model static scenes, for video prediction, it is essential
to also investigate the temporal dynamics. Models are trained
to predict raw pixels of the future frame by learning from
historical motion patterns. There is another line of work on
video synthesis without any history frames.

Similar to research on image generation, some work in-
vestigated unconditional video generation. That is, directly
generating video clips from noise by using generative adver-
sarial networks to learn a mapping between spatial-temporal
latent space and video clips [31, 25]. Another group of re-
searchers worked on video-to-video translation [37], where
a sequence of frames are generated according to a sequence
of aligned semantic representations.

pix2pixvid2vidseg2vidFigure 2: Overview of our two step generation network. In
the ﬁrst stage, we generate the starting frame by mapping
from a semantic label map. In the second stage, we use our
ﬂow prediction network to transform the initial frame to a
video sequence.

In this work, we study video generation with a setting
similar to the video-to-video work [37] except that it is only
conditioned on a single frame‘s semantic label map. Com-
pared to previous works on video generation, our setting
not only provides control over the generation process but
also allows high variability in the results. Conditioning the
generation on semantic label map helps avoid producing un-
desirable results (e.g. a car driving on the pavement) which
often occurs in unconditional generation. Furthermore, we
can generate cars moving at different speeds or in different
directions, which is not possible in the video-to-video set-
ting. One intuitive idea to address this new task would be to
train an end-to-end conditional generative model. However,
it is not easy to apply such a model to datasets composed
of diverse objects and background, i.e. different objects in
different scenes have different motions. In reality, training
a single end-to-end model to simultaneously model both
appearance and motion of these objects and scenes is very
hard. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 2, we take a divide-and-
conquer strategy, designed to model appearance and motion
in a progressive manner.

In the ﬁrst stage, we aim to transform a semantic label
map to a frame such that the appearance of scene is syn-
thesized, which falls into the category of image-to-image
translation. During translation process, the model only fo-
cuses on producing an image of good quality with reasonable
content.

In the next stage, future motion of the scene is predicted
based on the generated frame. Speciﬁcally, a conditional
VAE is employed to model uncertainty of future motion.
Different from existing video prediction tasks where mo-
tion information can be estimated from historical frames,
in our setting, we only have one semantic label map and
one generated frame available. We argue that it is impor-
tant for the model to leverage the semantic meaning of the
ﬁrst frame when predicting motion. For example, buildings
and pedestrians have very distinctive motion. We take both
the semantic label map and the generated frame as input
and feed them into a motion prediction model. Empirical

results demonstrate that with semantic representation as in-
put, the model can learn better motion for dynamic objects
than without that, specially for complex scenes with multiple
classes of objects. We model motion with optical ﬂow. Once
ﬂows are predicted, they are directly applied to warp the ﬁrst
frame to synthesize future frames. Finally, a post-processing
network is added to rectify imperfection caused during the
warping operation. Inspired by[21], we further improve the
performance of ﬂow prediction and future frame generation
using bidirectional ﬂows and geometric consistency. Experi-
mental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method in video generation.

Our contributions are the following.

1. We introduce the novel task of conditioning video gen-
eration on a single semantic label map, allowing a good
balance between ﬂexibility and quality compared to
existing video generation approaches.

2. The difﬁcult task is divided into two sub-problems,
i.e., image generation followed by image-to-sequence
generation, such that each stage can specialize on one
problem.

3. We make full use of the semantic categorical prior in
motion prediction when only one starting frame is avail-
able. It helps predict more accurate optical ﬂow, thereby
producing better future frames.

2. Related Work

Image generation Many work exists regarding image
generation which generally can be classiﬁed into two cat-
egories, unconditional generation and conditional genera-
tion. In unconditional generation, some work extends GANs
[10] or VAE [16] to map from noise to real data distribu-
tion. Auto-regressive architectures model the image on a
per-pixel basis [32, 22]. In the second category, conditional
models generate images given either class category, textual
descriptions, scene graphs or images [20, 2, 41, 15, 26]. Es-
pecially for image translation task, researchers study how
to generate a meaningful image from a semantic represen-
tation such as semantic label maps (paired and unpaired)
([12, 42, 38, 3, 26]). However, in image generation tasks,
photo-realism of the scene is modeled without considering
their motion information.

Video Generation Similar to Image generation, video
generation can also be divided into two categories: con-
ditional and unconditional.
For the former category,
VideoGAN [34] explicitly disentangles a scene’s foreground
from background under the assumption that the background
is stationary. The model is limited to only simple cases and
cannot handle scenes with a moving background due to cam-
era movement. TGAN [25] ﬁrst generates a sequence of
latent variables and then synthesize a sequence of frames

based on those latent variables. MoCoGAN [31] also tries to
map a sequence of random vectors to a sequence of frames.
However, their framework decomposes video into content
subspace and motion subspace, making video generation
process more controllable. For conditional video generation,
it is still at its early stage. One recent work is vid2vid [37] in
which authors aim at transforming a sequence of semantic
representation, e.g. semantic label map and sketch map, to
a sequence of video frames. Our work falls into the cate-
gory of conditional video generation, but unlike vid2vid, our
method only requires a single semantic label map as input
which enables more freedom over the generation process.

Video prediction Some work model future motion in a
deterministic manner. In [23, 29, 33], future prediction is
carried out in a latent space, and the representation of future
frames is projected back to image domain. These models
are directly trained to optimize a reconstruction loss, such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE), between the predicted frames
and ground truth frames. However, they are prone to con-
verging to blurry results as they compute an average of all
possible future outcomes for the same starting frame. In
[19, 13, 8], future motion is predicted using either optical
ﬂow or ﬁlter, where estimation and then corresponding spa-
tial transformation is applied to history frames to produce
future frames. The result is sharp but lacks diversity. A
group of researchers [39, 36, 7, 1] introduced conditional
variational autoencoders for video prediction to model uncer-
tainty in future motion allowing the results to be both sharp
and diverse. Similar to our work, Walker et al. [35] and
Li et al. [18] attempt to predict multiple future frames from
a static image. In the training phase, they take the ground

truth optical ﬂow, either human annotated or computed, as
supervision to predict such ﬂow, and transform the given
frame to future frames. Contrary to Walker et al. [35] and Li
et al. [18], we learn optical ﬂow in an unsupervised manner,
i.e., without taking any pre-computed ﬂow as supervision.

3. Semantic Label Map to Video Generation

Generating a video sequence V = {I0, I1, ..., IT } from
a single semantic label map S allows more ﬂexibility com-
pared to translating multiple label maps to a video, but is
also more challenging. In this work we propose to divide
such a difﬁcult task into two relatively easy sub-problems
and address each one separately, i.e., i) Image-to-Image (I2I):
an image generation model based on conditional GANs [38]
that maps a given semantic label map S to the starting frame
ˆI0 of a sequence, and ii) Image-to-Video (I2V): an image-
sequence generation network that produces a sequence of
frames ˆV = { ˆI0, ˆI1, ..., ˆIT } based on the generated starting
frame ˆI0 and a latent variable z. In each stage we have a
model specializing on the corresponding task such that the
overall performance is good.

3.1. Image to Image (I2I)

Image-to-image translation aims at learning the mapping
of an image in the source domain to its corresponding im-
age in the target domain. Among the existing methods
[12, 42, 38, 3], we adopt the state-of-the-art image trans-
lation model pix2pixHD [38] to generate an image from a
semantic label map. It includes a coarse-to-ﬁne architec-
ture to progressively produce high quality images with ﬁne

lation stage is not restricted to this method and other image
translation approaches can substitute pix2pixHD.

3.2. Image to Video (I2V)

In this section, we present how to use cVAE for image
sequence generation conditioned on an initial frame obtained
from Sec. 3.1. It is composed of two sub-modules, i.e., ﬂow
prediction and video frame generation from ﬂow. Fig. 3
shows the network structure and the components of the pro-
posed Image-to-Video model.

Conditional VAE - Compared to future prediction from
multiple frames, where the future motion can be estimated
based on past sequence, motion predicted from one single
frame can be more diverse. We employ the conditional
VAE (cVAE) model [39] as the backbone to capture multiple
possible future motions conditioned on a static image. The
proposed cVAE is composed of an encoder and a decoder.
The encoder Q(z|V, I0) learns to map a starting frame I0
and the subsequent frames V = {I1, ..., IT } into a latent
variable z that carries information about motion distribution
conditioned on the ﬁrst frame I0. To achieve such mapping,
the latent variable z is composed of two parts, one projecting
from the whole sequence including both I0 and V , and the
other from only the initial frame I0. The decoder P (V |z, I0)
then reconstructs the sequence and outputs ˆV based on a
sampled z and I0. During training, the encoder Q(z|V, I0)
learns to match the standard normal distribution, N (0, I).
When running inference, the cVAE will generate a video
sequence from a given starting frame I0 and a latent variable
z sampled from N (0, I) without the need of the motion
encoder.

Flow Prediction - We ﬁrst use an image encoder to trans-
form the starting frame into a latent vector zI0 as a part of
the latent variable z. The whole sequence is sent to another
sequence encoder to compute zm, which makes up the other
part of z for uncertainty modeling. zI0 and zm are concate-
nated as one vector z which is fed to a decoder to compute
future optical ﬂow. For motion generation, we predict bidi-
rectional ﬂows, i.e. both forward ﬂow from the initial frame
to future frames and backward ﬂow from future frames to
the initial frame. Computing cycle ﬂow allows us to perform
forward-backward consistency checks. For regions which
appear in both frames (A and B), correspondence between
two frames can be captured both from A to B and from B
to A. We compute an occlusion mask to omit regions which
are either occluded or missing in the generated frame so that
the consistency check is only conducted on non-occluded
regions. Putting all this together, the resulting output of the
cVAE is the optical ﬂow as well as the occlusion mask for
both forward and backward directions, deﬁned as:

are jointly predicted by our image-to-ﬂow module. Note that
both bidirectional and occlusion maps are learned without
any pre-computed ﬂow as supervision.

Video frame Generation - With the predicted optical
ﬂow, we can directly produce future frames by warping the
initial frame. However, the generated frames obtained solely
by warping has inherent ﬂaws, as some parts of the objects
may not be visible in one frame but appears in another. To
ﬁll in the holes caused by either occlusion or objects entering
or leaving the scene, we propose to add a post-processing
network after frame warping. It takes a warped frame and its
corresponding occlusion mask Ob as the input, and generates
the reﬁned frame. The ﬁnal output of our model is deﬁned
as follows:

ˆIt(x) = P(ob

t(x) · I0(x + w

b
t (x))),

(2)

where P is the post-processing network and x denotes the
coordinates of a position in the frame.

Loss Function - Our loss function contains both per-
pixel reconstruction and uncertainty modeling. For the per-
pixel reconstruction, we compute losses in both the forward
and backward direction, formulated as

Lr(W f , W b, V ) =

X

(3)
where T is the length of the generated sequence. We only
compute reconstruction in non-occluded regions to avoid
learning incorrect deformations. Neighboring pixels usually
belong to the same object, thus they tend to have similar
displacement. Therefore, similar to previous work [40, 30]
we also add a smoothness constraint to encourage ﬂow in a
local neighborhood to be similar.

Lf s(W f , W b) = |∇W f |1 + |∇W b|1

We compute forward-backward consistency loss for non-
occluded regions:

To train the in-painting network, we applied an L1 loss
together with a perceptual loss [14] that has been shown to
be useful for image generation. Therefore, our data loss can
be formulated as a weighed sum of the above terms.

Ldata( ˆV , V ) = λrLr + λf sLf s + λf cLf c

+ Ll1( ˆV , V ) + Ll1(φ( ˆV ), φ(V ))
+ λp|1 − Ob|1 + λp|1 − Of |1,

(6)

where φ is VGG-19 [27] from where we extract and col-
lect features from the ﬁrst 16 layers. We add a penalty on
the occlusion maps for λp = 0.1 to avoid the trivial solu-
tion where all pixels become occluded (we deﬁne the value
in a position of Ob to be 0 when the pixels is becoming
occluded in the next frame). The weights are set to be:
λr = λf s = λf c = λl1 = 1 and β = 0.1. To model the
motion uncertainty we incorporate the KL-divergence loss
such that Q(z|X) matches N (0, I). The training loss for the
cVAE is a data loss combined with a KL-divergence loss.

LcV AE( ˆV , V ) =Ldata + βDkl(pφ(z|V )||p(z)).

3.3. Flow prediction with semantic label maps

Different from video prediction conditioned on multiple
frames, generating a video from a static frame has no access
to historical motion information. To infer future motion of a
object in a static frame, the model needs to understand the
semantic category of that object and its interaction with other
objects and background. For example, the car will stop when
the trafﬁc light is red and move on when is green. To promote
future motion estimation for the whole frame, we incorporate
semantic label map which describes semantic information of
the whole scene into the ﬂow prediction module discussed
in previous sub-section.

We explore two ways of integrating the semantic label
map for ﬂow prediction. In the ﬁrst method, we expand a
semantic label map into several heatmaps which is ﬁlled
with ones on positions correspond to a semantic category
and zeros elsewhere. These heatmaps are concatenated with
the generated starting frame and fed to the cVAE model for
future frame synthesis. In the other method, we further di-
vide the heatmaps into two sets, i.e., foreground heatmaps
and background heatmaps, as shown in Fig. 4. Each set of
heatmaps is fed to a separate sequence encoder to get a latent
vector zF G and zBG. They are then concatenated with zI0
becoming the input to the ﬂow decoder. In Section 4, exper-
imental results demonstrate that integrating semantic label
map helps computing more accurate ﬂow and accordingly
improve the video generation performance.

4. Experiments

In this section we present the dataset and describe the
details about the implementation. We evaluate our method

coder only focuses on learning either foreground or back-
ground motion.

against several baseline methods with both qualitative and
quantitative metrics. We also perform ablation studies to
conﬁrm the effectiveness of using semantic label maps for
video generation.

4.1. Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

Datasets We have conducted experiments on the
Cityscapes dataset while we have provided qualitative results
on the many other datasets. Cityscapes [6] consists of urban
scene videos recorded from a car driving on the street. It con-
tains 2,975 training, 500 validation and 1,525 test video se-
quences, each containing 30 frames. The ground truth seman-
tic segmentation mask is only available for the 20th frame
of every video. We use DeepLabV3[5] to compute semantic
segmentation maps for all frames, which are used for train-
ing and testing. We train the model using all videos from the
training set, and test it on the validation set. UCF101 [28]
The dataset contains 13, 220 videos of 101 action classes.
KTH Action dataset [17] consists of 600 videos of people
performing one of the six actions(walking, jogging, running,
boxing, handwaving, hand-clapping). KITTI [9] similar to
Cityscpes was recorded from a car traversing streets.

Evaluation Metrics We provide both quantitative and
qualitative evaluation results in this section. For qualita-
tive evaluation, we conducted a human subjective study to
evaluate our method as well as the baseline methods. We
randomly generated 100 video sequences for each method,
pairing each generated video with the result of another ran-
domly chosen method. The participants are asked to choose
from each pair the most realistic looking video. We calculate
the human preference score after each pair of videos was
evaluated by 10 participants.

The Fr´echet Inception Distance (FID) [11] measures the
similarity between two sets of images.
It was shown to
correlate well with human judgment of visual quality and

is most often used to evaluate the quality of samples from
GANs. FID is calculated by computing the Fr´echet distance
between two feature representations of the Inception network.
Similar to [37], we use the video inception network [4] to
extract spatio-temporal feature representations.

4.2. Implementation details

Our method takes a single semantic label map S and
predict T = 8 frames in a single step. We resize all frames to
128 × 128 and extract the semantic segmentation maps with
DeepLabV3 [5] for training. We do not use any ﬂow map as
ground truth for training. In the cVAE, the motion encoder is
built upon stacks of 2D convolutional layers intercepted with
max pooling layers. The latent vector z has dimension 1024,
896 for foreground motion and 128 for background motion.
For the ﬂow encoder, we use three blocks each consisting of
3D convolutional layers intercepted with bilinear upsampling
layer that progressively recovers the input resolution in both
spatial and temporal dimensions. For the postprocessing
network, we adopt the U-Net architecture from [24].

4.3. Ablation Studies

We conduct extensive experiments on the Cityscapes
dataset to analyze the contribution of the semantic label
map and optical ﬂow for motion prediction. We have shown
that optical ﬂow is reliable motion representation to convey
motion between frames and preserver better visual quality.
Fig. 9 shows that the model without optical ﬂow produces
blurry frames. In contrast, our ﬂow based solution preserves
better details even on fast moving objects and produces fewer
artifacts.

We also compare frame sequences generated by the model
without semantic label map and two ways of integrating that.
As shown in Fig. 10, the model integrating semantic label
map is able to capture both foreground object motion and
background motion, whereas the one without that fails to
estimate the independent foreground object motion. By fur-
ther separating semantic label maps into background and
foreground, it can capture more details in structure marked
by the red rectangles. As expected, semantic information
plays an important role in generating object motion when
predicting from a single frame. We show further improve-
ments by separating semantic classes into two groups based
on background and foreground.

4.4. Baselines

We compare our network with ﬁve state-of-the-art base-

line methods trained on the Cityscapes dataset.

MoCoGAN [31] is an unconditional video generation
model. Here, we also compared the conditional setting of
MoCoGAN, given the initial frame x0 as input.

FlowGrounded (FG) [18] is a video prediction model
from a static image. We compare our image-to-video stage
with this method on both video generation and video predic-
tion tasks.

Vid2Vid [37], the goal of vid2vid is to map a sequence
of semantic represenation to a sequence of video frames,
where future motion is approximately given in the semantic
segmentation sequence. We evaluate vid2vid to see whether
our method is comparable to this ”upper bound”.

4.5. Results

Quantitative Results In Table 1 we report the results on
the Cityscapes dataset. In terms of performance, the lower
the FID, the better the model. In Table 1, we show that
our method has the lowest FID compared to all competing
methods. Notice that the results here are slightly different
from what is reported by Wang et al. [38] because we only
evaluate 8-frame sequences with a resolution of 1024 × 512
due to GPU memory limitations. We generated a total of
500 short sequences on the validation set. We also provide
results for video prediction when only the starting frame is
given. As shown in Table 2, our method outperforms all
other state-of-the-art approaches in video prediction from a

Qualitative Results Fig. 6 compares our generation re-

ance). FG fails to synthesize the details of the scene,e.g.

structure of the scene for the duration of the sequence and
contains ﬁner details than the previous two methods. The
proposed method makes reasonable estimates of the objects’
future motion and produces temporally coherent video se-
quence. Compared to the ground truth sequence, our model
can generate semantically correct samples but with different
properties, e.g., a white car in the ground truth sequence
appears as a silver car in our result. For vid2vid, where the
input is a sequence of semantic label maps, shows realistic
images with great details, but limited on preserving the tem-
poral consistency across frames, e.g. the silver car in t = 3

employed a divide and conquer strategy to model appear-
ance and motion in a progressive manner to obtain quality
results. We demonstrated that introducing semantic infor-
mation brings large improvement when predicting motion
from static content. The impressive performance compared
to other baselines indicate the effectiveness of the proposed

has turned into black in t = 7, while our methods keeps the
same color. To further show the effectiveness of our method
on predicting general motions, we provide visual results on
UCF-101 dataset and KTH action dataset that mainly con-
sist on people performing actions. As shown in Fig. 7, our
method preserves well the body structure and synthesizing
complex non-linear motions such as people skiing, playing
violin and walking. We trained the model on Cityscapes
and tested on samples from KITTI to show the method‘s
generalization ability, shown in Fig. 8.

The user study illustrated in Table. 3 also shown that our
method is the most favored except vid2vid. Additionally to
the results of synthesized data, we also reported results for
video prediction task. As shown in Fig. 5 our method can
predict well background motion and simultaneously captured
the movement of the car on the left side. The details and
structure of the scene is well preserved with our approach
while other methods suffer severe deformation. Table 4
shows that participants ﬁnd our method to be more realistic.

5. Conclusion

In this work, we introduced the new video generation
task conditioned only on a single semantic label map, and
proposed a novel method for this task. Instead of learning
the generation end-to-end, which is very challenging, we
