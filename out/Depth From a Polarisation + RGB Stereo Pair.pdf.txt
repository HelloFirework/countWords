Abstract

In this paper, we propose a hybrid depth imaging sys-
tem in which a polarisation camera is augmented by a sec-
ond image from a standard digital camera. For this modest
increase in equipment complexity over conventional shape-
from-polarisation, we obtain a number of beneﬁts that en-
able us to overcome longstanding problems with the polar-
isation shape cue. The stereo cue provides a depth map
which, although coarse, is metrically accurate. This is used
as a guide surface for disambiguation of the polarisation
surface normal estimates using a higher order graphical
model. In turn, these are used to estimate diffuse albedo.
By extending a previous shape-from-polarisation method to
the perspective case, we show how to compute dense, de-
tailed maps of absolute depth, while retaining a linear for-
mulation. We show that our hybrid method is able to re-
cover dense 3D geometry that is superior to state-of-the-art
shape-from-polarisation or two view stereo alone.

1. Introduction

Surface reﬂection changes the polarisation state of light.
By measuring the polarisation state of reﬂected light, we are
able to infer information about the material properties and
geometry of the surface. Polarisation is a particularly attrac-

tive shape estimation cue because it is dense (surface orien-
tation information is available at every pixel), can be applied
to smooth, featureless, glossy surfaces (on which multiview
methods would fail to ﬁnd correspondences) and it can be
captured in a single shot (using a polarisation camera). For
this reason, the shape-from-polarisation cue has recently
been rediscovered and signiﬁcant progress has been made
in the past three years [2, 7, 9, 15, 16, 18, 24, 28, 29, 34].

Recent work has posed shape-from-polarisation in terms
of direct estimation of orthographic surface height [27–29].
This is attractive because it halves the degrees of freedom
(one height value per pixel rather than two values to rep-
resent surface orientation) and avoids the two step process
of surface orientation estimation followed by surface inte-
gration to obtain a height map. However, polarisation cues
do not provide any direct constraints on metric depth, only
on local surface orientation. Hence, the surfaces recovered
by these methods are globally inaccurate and subject to low
frequency distortion. Moreover, the orthographic assump-
tion is practically limiting.

For this reason, in this paper we consider a hybrid setup
in which a single polarisation image is augmented by a sec-
ond image from a standard RGB camera. This provides us
with a conventional stereo cue from which we can compute
coarse but metrically accurate depth estimates. This serves
a number of purposes. First, this provides coarse guide nor-

larisation cue. Second, it is used to regularise the ﬁnal re-
construction, resolving scale ambiguity and reducing low
frequency bias. We make a number of novel contributions:

1. Use a higher order graphical model to capture integrabil-

ity constraints during disambiguation

2. Show how to automatically label pixels as diffuse or

specular dominant via our graphical model

3. Show how to incorporate gradient-consistency con-

straints into albedo estimation

4. Extend the linear formulation of Smith et al. [28] to the
perspective case, retaining linearity and also including
the stereo depth map as a guide surface

Our approach has a number of practical advantages over re-
cent state-of-the-art. Unlike Smith et al. [28] we do not
assume uniform albedo. Unlike Kadambi et al. [15, 16], we
do not use a depth (kinect) camera and so our capture envi-
ronment is not restricted. We compare to these and other
relevant state-of-the-art methods and obtain better recon-
structions. Compared to [7–9, 33], we only require a single
polarisation image.

1.1. Related work

Shape-from-polarisation. Both Miyazaki et al. [22] and
Atkinson and Hancock [3] used a diffuse polarisation model
to estimate surface normals from the phase angle and de-
gree of polarisation. They use a local, greeedy method that
propagates from the object boundary assuming global con-
vexity. This is very sensitive to noise, limits applicability
to objects with a visible occluding boundary and does not
consider integrability. Morel et al. [23] took a similar ap-
proach but used a specular polarisation model suitable for
metallic surfaces. Huynh et al. [13] also assumed convexity
to disambiguate the polarisation normals.
Polarisation and X. A variety of work seeks to augment
polarisation with an additional shape-from-X cue. Huynh
et al. [14] extended their earlier work to use multispectral
measurements to estimate both shape and refractive index.
Drbohlav and Sara [10] showed how the Bas-relief ambigu-
ity [6] in uncalibrated photometric stereo could be resolved
using polarisation. However, this approach requires a po-
larised light source. Coarse geometry obtained by multi-
view space carving [20, 21] has been used to resolve po-
larisation ambiguities. Kadambi et al. [15, 16] combine a
single polarisation image with a depth map obtained by an
RGBD camera. The depth map is used to disambiguate the
normals and provide a base surface for integration. Our ap-
proach uses a simpler setup in that it does not require a
depth camera. Mahmoud et al. [17] and Smith et al. [28]
augment polarisation with a shape-from-shading cue. The
later shows how to solve directly for surface height (i.e. rel-
ative depth) by solving a large, sparse linear system of equa-

tions. However, they assume constant albedo and ortho-
graphic projection - all assumptions that we avoid. Follow-
up work showed how to estimate albedo independently [27].
Yu et al. [34] take a similar approach but avoid linearising
the objective function, instead directly minimising the true
nonlinear objective. This allows the use of reﬂectance and
polarisation models of arbitrary complexity. Ngo et al. [24]
derived constraints that allowed surface normals, light di-
rections and refractive index to be estimated from polarisa-
tion images under varying lighting. However, this approach
requires at least 4 light directions. Atkinson [2] combine
calibrated two source photometric stereo with polarisation
phase and resolve ambiguities via a region growing process.
Tozza et al. [29] generalised [28] to consider two source
photo-polarimetric shape estimation. Subsequently, Mecca
et al. [18] also proposed a differential formulation with a
well-posed solution for two light sources.
Multiview Polarisation. Some of the earliest work on po-
larisation vision used a stereo pair of polarisation measure-
ments to determine the orientation of a plane [30]. Rah-
mann and Canterakis [26] combined a specular polarisa-
tion model with stereo cues. Similarly, Atkinson and Han-
cock [5] used polarisation normals to segment an object into
patches, simplifying stereo matching. Note however that
this method is restricted to the case of an object rotating
on a turntable with known angle. Stereo polarisation cues
have also been used for transparent surface modelling [19].
Berger et al. [7] used polarisation stereo for depth estima-
tion of specular scenes. Cui et al. [9] incorporate a polarisa-
tion phase angle cue into multiview stereo enabling recov-
ery of surface shape in featureless regions. Chen et al. [8]
provide a theoretical treament of constraints arising from
three view polarisation. Yang et al. [33] propose a variant
of monocular SLAM using polarisation video. All of these
methods require multiple polarisation images whereas our
proposed approach uses only a single polarisation image
augmented by a standard RGB image from a second view.

2. Problem formulation

In this section we list our assumptions and introduce no-
tations, the perspective surface depth representation and ba-
sic polarisation theory.

2.1. Assumptions

Our method makes the following assumptions:

• Intrinsic parameters of both cameras known
• Dielectric material with known refractive index
• Distant point light source with known direction
• Diffuse reﬂectance follows Lambert’s law
• Object is smooth, i.e. C 2-continuous (integrable)

These assumptions are all common to previous work. We
draw attention to the fact that we do not assume ortho-

7587

graphic projection, known albedo or that pixels have been
labelled as diffuse or specular dominant, making our ap-
proach more general than previous work.

2.2. Perspective depth representation

Our setup consists of a polarisation camera and an RGB
camera. We work in the coordinate system of the polarisa-
tion camera and parameterise the surface by the unknown
depth function Z(u), where u = (x, y) is a location in the
polarisation image. The 3D coordinate at u is given by:

P (u) = 


x−x0

y−y0

f Z(u)
f Z(u)
Z(u)

,




(1)

where f is the focal length of the polarisation camera in the
x and y directions and (x0, y0) is the principal point. The
direction of the outward pointing surface normal is deﬁned
as the cross product of the partial derivatives with respect to
x and y [11]:

n(u) =


(2)

+ Z(u)2
fxfy

where Zx, Zy denotes the partial derivative of Z(u) w.r.t. x
and y. Note that the magnitude of n(u) is arbitrary, only its
direction is important. For this reason, we can cancel any
common factors. In particular, we can divide through by
Z(u) to remove quadratic terms and multiply through by
fxfy to avoid numerical instability caused by division by
fxfy (which is potentially very large):

n(u) = 


−fyZx(u)
−fxZy(u)

(x − x0)Zx(u) + (y − y0)Zy(u) + Z(u)


(3)

We denote by ¯n(u) = n(u)/kn(u)k, the unit length sur-
face normal.

The vector pointing towards the viewer from a point on

the surface is given by:

v(u) = −h x−x0

Note that this is independent of surface depth.

j ∈ {1, . . . , P }. The measured intensity at a pixel varies
sinusoidally with the polariser angle, it can be written as:

(5)

iϑj (u) = iun(u)(cid:0)1 + ρ(u) cos(2ϑj − 2φ(u))(cid:1).

The polarisation image is thus obtained by decomposing the
sinusoid at every pixel location into three quantities [31]:
the phase angle, φ(u), the degree of polarisation, ρ(u), and
the unpolarised intensity, iun(u). The parameters of the si-
nusoid can be estimated from the captured image sequence
using non-linear least squares [4], linear methods [13] or via
a closed form solution [31] for the speciﬁc case of P = 3,
ϑ ∈ {0◦, 45◦, 90◦}.

A polarisation image provides a constraint on the surface
normal direction at each pixel. The exact nature of the con-
straint depends on the polarisation model used. In this pa-
per we will consider diffuse polarisation, due to subsurface
scattering (see [4] for more details), and specular polarisa-
tion due to direct reﬂection.

Degree of polarisation constraint. The degree of diffuse
polarisation ρd(u) at each point u can be expressed in terms
of the refractive index η and, in the perspective case, the
viewing angle θ(u) = arccos [¯n(u) · v(u)] ∈ [0, π
2 ] as fol-
lows (Cf. [4]):

ρd(u) =

(η − 1/η)2 sin2 θ(u)

(6)

.

2+2η2 −(η+1/η)2 sin2 θ(u)+4 cos θ(u)pη2 − sin2 θ(u)

This expression can be inverted. From the measured degree
of polarisation, the viewing angle θ(u) (and hence one de-
gree of freedom of the surface normal) can be estimated by
rewriting (6) [28]. This relates the cosine of the viewing an-
gle to a function, f (ρ(u), η), that depends on the measured
degree of polarisation and the refractive index:

cos θ(u) = n(u) · v(u) = f (ρ(u), η) =

d +ρd −1)+ρ2

d +2ρd −4η3ρdp1−ρ2

d + 2ρd − 1)

d +1

where we drop the dependency of ρd on (u) for brevity.
Similarly, the degree of polarisation of a specular reﬂection
is given by:

ρs(u) =

2 sin2 θ(u) cos θ(u)qη2 − sin2 θ(u)

η2 − sin2 θ(u) − η2 sin2 θ(u) + 2 sin4 θ(u)

.

(8)
This expression has two solutions possible solutions for
θ(u) given a measured degree of specular polarisation.

When unpolarised light is reﬂected by a surface it be-
comes partially polarised [31]. The polarisation informa-
tion can be estimated by capturing a sequence of images in
which a linear polarising ﬁlter mounting on camera lens is
rotated through a sequence of P ≥ 3 different angles ϑj ,

Phase angle constraint The phase angle determines the
azimuth angle of the surface normal α(u) ∈ [0, 2π] up to
a 180◦ ambiguity. For diffuse dominant reﬂectance this is
given by:

α(u) = φ(u) or (φ(u) + π),

(9)

7588

and for specular dominant reﬂectance by:

α(u) = φ(u) ±

π

.

(10)

Diffuse shading constraint Under the assumption of per-
fect diffuse reﬂectance, the unpolarised intensity for diffuse
dominant pixels follows Lambert’s law:

to two, given four possible normal directions in total. Pre-
vious work [15, 28] assumes that the labelling of pixels as
specular or diffuse dominant is known in advance. We do
not assume that the labels are known and propose an initial
resolution of this six-way ambiguity using a higher order
graphical model. The motivation for using a higher order
model is that a ternary potential can measure deviation from
integrability.

We set up an energy cost function to be mimised w.r.t. the

id(u) =

a(u)n(u) · s

knk

,

(11)

surface normal as follows:

where s ∈ R3 is the known distant point source direction
and a(u) ∈ [0, 1] the diffuse albedo at pixel u.

Diffuse/specular dominance We assume that total re-
ﬂectance is a mixture of subsurface diffuse reﬂectance, id,
and specular surface reﬂection, is (for which we do not as-
sume any particular reﬂectance model). This means that
observed sinusoid is a sum of two sinusoids with a phase
difference of π/2. The resulting sinusoid will be in phase
with either the diffuse or specular sinusoid depending on
which reﬂectance “dominates”. Concretely, if idρd > isρs
then the pixel is diffuse dominant and we neglect specular
reﬂectance, i.e. we assume iun = id.

3. Overview of method

Our proposed method comprises the following steps:

1. Estimate the disparity from stereo images and recon-

struct a coarse depth map by known camera matrix.

2. Compute guide surface normals by taking the gradient of

the coarse depth map.

3. Use guide surface normal to disambiguate the polarisa-

tion normals via a higher order graphical model.

4. Estimate diffuse albedo from disambiguated polarisation

normals.

5. Linearly estimate perspective depth from polarisation us-

ing coarse depth map as a constraint.

Our pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 1 and each step is de-
scribed in detail in the following sections.

4. Integrability-based disambiguation with a

higher order graphical model

The constraints in Section 2.3 restrict the surface nor-
mal at a pixel to six possible directions. If the pixel is dif-
fuse dominant, then the viewing angle is uniquely deter-
mined by the degree of polarisation and the azimuth angle
restricted to two possibilities by the phase angle, leading to
two possible normal directions. If the pixel is specular dom-
inant, the degree of polarisation restricts the viewing angle
to two possibilities, with the azimuth again also restricted

E(n(u)) = Xu∈ν

Φ(n(u)) + X(u,v)∈N

ϕ(L(u), L(v))

+ X(u,v,w)∈T

Ψ(n(u), n(v), n(w))

(12)

Here ν corresponds to all foreground pixels, N is the set of
adjacent pixels and T is the set of pixel triplets (u, v, w)
where u = (x, y), v = (x + 1, y) and w = (x, y + 1).
Before further explaining the energy terms, let us clarify
two important elements that will be used in following. 1).
The stereo setup produces a coarse depth map by computing
the disparity from the camera pair. We use the semi-global
matching method [12] to compute the disparity and recon-
struct a depth map with the camera matrices, as displayed
in Figure 2(a). Thus its surface normal can be computed
by simply taking the forward difference on the coarse depth
map. We denote these surface normal by ˆn where they are
noisy as shown in Figure 2(b). 2). We make a rough initial
estimate of the specular/diffuse dominant pixel labelling, L.
We simply set L(u) = 1 if the measured intensity is satu-
rated (Figure 2(c)). L will be subsequently updated (Figure
2(f)).

Unary cost The unary term aims to minimise the angle
between n(u) and ˆn(u), where n(u) has up to six solu-
tions. We denote the ﬁrst two solutions from diffuse com-
ponent in D and the rest from specular component in S . We
also take account the initial specular mask L i.e. Where the
diffuse normal will be assigned to low probability if its cor-
responding specular mask equal to one. The unary cost can
be written as

Φ(n(u)) =

(k · f (u)

f (u)

if (L(u) = 1, n(u) ∈ D) or (L(u) = 0, n(u) ∈ S)
if (L(u) = 0, n(u) ∈ D) or (L(u) = 1, n(u) ∈ S)

where f (u) depends on the cosine of the angle between n(u) and
ˆn(u) and is deﬁned as

f (u) = exp(−n(u) · ˆn(u)).

(13)

The parameter k < 1 penalises surface normal disambiguations
that are not consistent with the corresponding specular mask. We
set k = 0.1 in our experiments.

7589

Pairwise cost We encourage pairwise pixels in N to have
similar diffuse or specular labels and penalise where the labels
changed. We deﬁne

ϕ(L(u), L(v)) = |L(u) − L(v)|.

(14)

Ternary cost
In order to encourage the disambiguated surface
normals to satisfy the integrability constraint, we use a ternary cost
to measure deviation from integrability. For an integrable surface,
the mixed second order partial derivatives on the gradient ﬁeld
should be equal [25]. Speciﬁcally, ∂p
∂x . Where p, q are
the partial derivatives in the x and y direction respectively. The
surface gradient is directly linked to the surface normal by

∂y = ∂q

p(u) = −nx(u)/nz(u)

and q(u) = −ny(u)/nz(u)

We take three-pixel neighbourhoods (u, v, w) to compute the gra-
dient of p, q, where

∂p(u)

∂y

= p(w) − p(u) ,

∂q(u)

∂x

= q(v) − q(u)

In reality, due to noise and the discretisation to the pixel grid, the
gradient ﬁeld may not have exactly zero curl, but we seek the sur-
face normals that give minimum curl values. Hence, the ternary
cost is deﬁned by:

Ψ(n(u), n(v), n(w)) = kp(w) − p(u) − (q(v) − q(u))k .

Graphical model optimisation We use higher order belief-
propagation to minimise (12) as implemented in the OpenGM
toolbox [1]. The optimum surface normal n′ will be labeled as
one of the six possible disambiguations and we update our specu-
lar mask L according to:

L(u) =(0 if n(u) ∈ D

1 if n(u) ∈ S

.

The surface normals that result from this disambiguation process
are still noisy (they use only local information) and may be subject
to low frequency bias meaning that integrating them into a depth
map does not yield good results. Hence, in Section 6 we solve
globally for depth, using the stereo depth map as a guide to remove
low frequency bias.

specular mask via graphical model.

(d) One possible polarisation normal.

The estimated albedo minimises the following energy function

E(u) = ELamb(u) + λI Esmooth(u).

(15)

The ﬁrst term penalises the difference between rendered Lamber-
tian intensity and estimated unpolarised intensity:

ELamb(u) =(cid:13)(cid:13)a(u)n′ · (u)s − Id(u)(cid:13)(cid:13)

where Id is diffuse dominant pixels from the estimated unpolar-
isation intensity, α represents a pixel-wise albedo map, n′ is the
optimum surface normal map from the previous section and s the
light source. We can easily choose the diffuse pixels by excluding
the specular mask where L(u) = 1.

(16)

The second term penalises the difference between the estimated
albedo gradient and the sparsiﬁed unpolarised intensity gradient.
We denote the neighbour of u in x direction with v and y direction
with w, thus the smooth term can be written as

5. Albedo estimation with gradient consistency

+ ka(u) − a(w) − g(Id(u) − Id(w))k

Esmooth(u) = ka(u) − a(v) − g(Id(u) − Id(v))k

(17)

We now use the surface normals estimated by the graphical
model optimisation to compute an albedo map. In principal, the
albedo can be computed from these normals and the unpolarised
intensity simply by rearranging (11). However, this purely local
estimation is unstable and noise in the normals leads to artefacts
in the estimated albedo map. We propose a simple but very ef-
fective regularisation to resolve this problem. We encourage the
gradient of the estimated albedo map to be similar to the gradient
of the unpolarised intensities at points where the intensity gradi-
ent is above a threshold and zero elsewhere. In other words, we
encourage the albedo gradients to be sparse and hence the albedo
piecewise uniform.

where g(.) is a threshold function that returns 0 if the input is < t,
otherwise it returns the input albedo map only contains values on
the diffuse pixels, we ﬁll the hole on specular pixels with nearest
neighbour method. In Figure 3 we see how the smoothness term
affects the estimated albedo map and depth.

6. Linear perspective depth from polarisation

Finally, with albedo known and coarse depth values from two
view stereo, we are ready to estimate dense depth from polarisa-
tion. We generalise a perspective camera model from Smith et
al. [28], note that it differs via the use of the coarse depth values

and optimum normal from section 4. The fact that we estimate
metric depth rather than relative height. As in [28], we express
polarisation and shading constraints in the form of a large, sparse
linear system in the unknown depth values, meaning the method
is very efﬁcient and guaranteed to attain the globally optimal solu-
tion.

Phase angle constraint. The ﬁrst constraint encourages the
recovered surface normal to satisfy equation (10). Following [28],
the projection of the surface normal into the image plane (nx, ny)
should be collinear with the phase angle vector. We seperate pix-
els into diffuse dominant and specular dominant with the help of
specular mask L. The phase angle constraint for diffuse dominant
pixels and specular dominant pixels are represented in ﬁrst row
and second row respectively in this matrix form:

Shading/polarisation ratio constraint. Recall
the
viewing angle is the angle between the surface normal and the
viewer direction. Making the normalisation factor of the surface
normal explicit, we can write cos(θr(u)) = n(u)·v(u)
kn(u)k . By isolat-
ing the normalisation factor we arrive at:

that

kn(u)k =

n(u) · v(u)
cos(θr(u))

.

(19)

Substituting this into (11) we obtain:

n(u) · v(u)
cos(θr(u))

=

a(u)n(u) · s

iun(u)

(20)

Notice that our shading constraint only submit on the diffuse pix-
els. So we choose the pixels u ∈ D where L(u) = 0. Unlike [28],
the perspective model means that the view vectors depend on pixel
locations. Now we can reformulate the equation into a compact
matrix form with respect to the surface normal:

sx · a(u) cos θ(u) − iun(u)vx(u)
sy · a(u) cos θ(u) − iun(u)vy(u)

Global linear depth estimation. The relationship between
the surface normal and depth under perspective viewing is given by
(3). We can arrive at a linear relationship between the constraints
described above and the unknown depth.

We ﬁrst extend (3) to the whole image. Consider an image with
N foreground pixels whose unknown depth values are vectorised
in Z ∈ RN . The surface normal direction (unnormalised) can be
computed for all pixels with:

where X = diag(x1 −x0, . . . , xN −x0) and Y = diag(y1 −

ence approximations to the derivative of Z in the x and y di-
rections respectively. In practice, we use smoothed central
difference approximations where possible, reverting to cen-
tral or forward/backward differences where all neighbours
are not available. Hence Dx, Dy have at most six non-zero
values per row.

Combining (23) with (18), (21) and (22) leads to equa-
tions that are linear in depth. We now combine these equa-
tions into a large linear system of equations for the whole
image. Of the N foreground pixels we divide these into

where Zguide(ui) are the stereo depth values from Section
4 and W ∈ RK×N performs a sparse indices matrix of Z
at positions (x1, y1), . . . , (xK, yK). IN ∈ RN ×N is the
identity matrix and 04N +ND is the zero vector of length
4N +ND. A has 4N +ND rows, 3N columns and is sparse.
Each row evaluates one equation of the form of (18), (21)
and (22). λ > 0 is a weight which trades off the inﬂuence of
the guide depth values against satisfaction of the polarisa-
tion constraints. We then solve (24) in a least squares sense
using sparse linear least squares.

7. Experimental results

We present experimental results on both synthetic and
real data. We compare our method against [12, 15, 27, 28,
32], the differences are summarised in Table 1. We set
λI = 1, λ = 1 and t = 0.01 through our experiments.
Note that the source code for [15] is not available so we are
only able to compare against a single result provided by the
authors. Similarly, real image results for [32] were provided
by the author running the implementation for us. Whereas
[12,27,28] are open sourced and we compare quantitatively.
For synthetic data, we render images of the Stanford bunny
with Blinn-Phong reﬂectance with varying albedo texture
using the pinhole camera model, as shown in Figure 4 (left).
The texture map is from [35]. We simulate the effect of po-
larisation according to (5) by setting refractive index value
to 1.4 and corrupt the polarisation image and second cam-
era intensity by adding Gaussian noise with zero mean and
standard deviation σ. The metric ground truth of the depth
map is range between 72.33mm to 90.09mm.

In Figure 4 we show the estimated albedo map of the
synthetic data and compare with [27]. In Table 2 we show
the mean absolute error in the surface depth (in millimetre)
and mean angular error (in degrees) in the surface normals.
We include comparison with the initial stereo depth [12]

Figure 5: Qualitative shape estimation results on synthetic
data with comparison with [28]

and state-of-the-art polarisation methods [27, 28]. In Figure
5 we display the qualitative results of this experiment.

Next we show results on a dataset of real images. The
ﬁrst dataset is from [15]. Although the depth here is pro-
vided by a Kinect sensor, not stereo, our graphical model
optimisation in Section 4 can take any source of depth map.
In this case we replace the depth map with the Kinect one
and keep the rest of the process identical when we evaluate
the data. The comparison can be viewed in Figure 7 where
we show that our proposed result can give more details on
the reconstruction. In this experiment, we estimate the light
source direction using [28].

We then show results on our own collected data. We
place the polarisation and RGB cameras with parallel im-
age planes and the RGB camera shifted 5cm along the x
axis relative to the polarisation camera as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. We compare our method with [32] directly performed
by the author. In Figure 6 we show qualitative results for
three objects with glossy reﬂectance and varying albedo.

Our method gives improved detail (see insets) but also more
stable overall shape (see third row). Notice that in this ex-
periment we calibrated the light source in advance with a
uniform albedo sphere using method in [28].

8. Conclusions

In this paper we have proposed a method for estimating
dense depth and albedo maps for glossy, dielectric objects
with varying albedo. We do so using a hybrid imaging sys-
tem in which a polarisation image is augmented by a second
view from a standard RGB camera. We avoid assumptions
common to recent methods (constant albedo, orthographic
projection) and reduce low frequency distortion in the re-
covered depth maps through the stereo cue.

Since we rely on stereo, our method does not work well
on textureless objects. However, note that our method
works equally well with a Kinect depth map as the result
shows in Figure 7. We also assume the refractive index is
known in our framework. It could be potentially measured
given a sufﬁciently accurate guide depth map. Although
our stereo setup cannot provide this, it could potentially be
provided by photometric stereo or multiview stereo. There
are many exciting possibilities for extending this work. The
lighting, reﬂectance and polarisation models could be gen-
eralised.
In particular, a more comprehensive model of
mixed specular/diffuse reﬂectance and polarisation would
be beneﬁcial. Our linear approach is efﬁcient and does not

require initialisation, but it may be useful to subsequently
perform a nonlinear optimisation over all unknowns (depth,
albedo, refractive index) simultaneously such that the true
underlying objective function can be minimised (taking in-
spiration from [34]).
