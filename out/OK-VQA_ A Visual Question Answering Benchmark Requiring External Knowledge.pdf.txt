Abstract

Visual Question Answering (VQA) in its ideal form lets
us study reasoning in the joint space of vision and language
and serves as a proxy for the AI task of scene understand-
ing. However, most VQA benchmarks to date are focused
on questions such as simple counting, visual attributes, and
object detection that do not require reasoning or knowl-
edge beyond what is in the image. In this paper, we address
the task of knowledge-based visual question answering and
provide a benchmark, called OK-VQA, where the image
content is not sufﬁcient to answer the questions, encour-
aging methods that rely on external knowledge resources.
Our new dataset includes more than 14,000 questions that
require external knowledge to answer. We show that the
performance of the state-of-the-art VQA models degrades
drastically in this new setting. Our analysis shows that our
knowledge-based VQA task is diverse, difﬁcult, and large
compared to previous knowledge-based VQA datasets. We
hope that this dataset enables researchers to open up new
avenues for research in this domain.

1. Introduction

The ﬁeld of Visual Question Answering (VQA) has
made amazing strides in recent years, achieving record
numbers on standard VQA datasets [20, 4, 11, 17]. As origi-
nally conceived, VQA is not only a fertile ground for vision
and language research, but is also a proxy to evaluate AI
models for the task of open-ended scene understanding. In
its ideal form, VQA would require not only visual recog-
nition, but also logical reasoning and incorporating knowl-
edge about the world. However, current VQA datasets (e.g.,
[3, 47]) are focused mainly on recognition, and most ques-

Q: Which American 

president is associated 
with the stuffed animal 

seen here?

A: Teddy Roosevelt

Outside Knowledge

Another lasting, popular legacy of Roosevelt is the stuffed toy bears—teddy bears—
named after him following an incident on a hunting trip in Mississippi in 1902.

Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers ... and named after President 
Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt, the teddy bear became an iconic children's toy, 
celebrated in story, song, and film.

At the same time in the USA, Morris Michtom created the first teddy bear, after 
being inspired by a drawing of Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt with a bear cub.

Figure 1: We propose a novel dataset for visual question
answering, where the questions require external knowledge
resources to be answered. In this example, the visual con-
tent of the image is not sufﬁcient to answer the question. A
set of facts about teddy bears makes the connection between
teddy bear and the American president, which enables an-
swering the question.

tions are about simple counting, colors, and other visual
detection tasks, so do not require much logical reasoning
or association with external knowledge. The most difﬁcult
and interesting questions ideally require knowing more than
what the question entails or what information is contained
in the images.

Consider the question in Figure 1, which asks about the
relation between the teddy bear and an American president.
The information in the image here is not complete for an-
swering the question. We need to link the image content

to external knowledge sources, such as the sentences at the
bottom of the ﬁgure taken from Wikipedia. Given the ques-
tion, image, and Wikipedia sentences, there is now enough
information to answer the question: Teddy Roosevelt!

More recent research has started to look at how to in-
corporate knowledge-based methods into VQA [29, 30, 36,
37]. These methods have investigated incorporating knowl-
edge bases and retrieval methods into VQA datasets with a
set of associated facts for each question. In this work, we go
one step forward and design a VQA dataset which requires
VQA to perform reasoning using unstructured knowledge.
To enable research in this exciting direction, we in-
troduce a novel dataset, named Outside Knowledge VQA
(OK-VQA), which includes only questions that require ex-
ternal resources for answering them. On our dataset, we can
start to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of models in sce-
narios where the answer cannot be obtained by only looking
at the image. Answering OK-VQA questions is a challeng-
ing task since, in addition to understanding the question and
the image, the model needs to: (1) learn what knowledge is
necessary to answer the questions, (2) determine what query
to do to retrieve the necessary knowledge from an outside
source of knowledge, and (3) incorporate the knowledge
from its original representation to answer the question.

The OK-VQA dataset consists of more than 14,000 ques-
tions that cover a variety of knowledge categories such as
science & technology, history, and sports. We provide cat-
egory breakdowns of our dataset, as well as other relevant
statistics to examine its properties. We also analyze state-
of-the-art models and show their performance degrades on
this new dataset. Furthermore, we provide results for a set
of baseline approaches that are based on simple knowledge
retrieval. Our dataset is diverse, difﬁcult, and to date the
largest VQA dataset focused on knowledge-based VQA in
natural images.

Our contributions are: (a) we introduce the OK-VQA
dataset, which includes only questions that require external
resources to answer; (b) we benchmark some state-of-the-
art VQA models on our new dataset and show the perfor-
mance of these models degrades drastically; (c) we propose
a set of baselines that exploit unstructured knowledge.

2. Related Work

Visual Question Answering (VQA). Visual question an-
swering (VQA) has been one of the most popular topics in
the computer vision community over the past few years.
Early approaches to VQA combined recurrent networks
with CNNs to integrate textual and visual data [27, 1].
Attention-based models [11, 25, 39, 40, 41, 47] better guide
the model in answering the questions by highlighting im-
age regions that are relevant to the question. Modular net-
works [2, 15, 19] leverage the compositional nature of the
language in deep neural networks. These approaches have

been extended to the video domain as well [16, 28, 35]. Re-
cently, [13, 9] address the problem of question answering in
an interactive environment. None of these approaches, how-
ever, is designed for leveraging external knowledge so they
cannot handle the cases that the image does not represent
the full knowledge to answer the question.

The problem of using external knowledge for answer-
ing questions has been tackled by [38, 36, 37, 23, 30, 29].
These methods only handle the knowledge that is repre-
sented by subject-relation-object or visual concept-relation-
attribute triplets, and rely on supervision to do the retrieval
of facts. In contrast, answering questions in our dataset re-
quires handling unstructured knowledge resources.

VQA datasets. In the past few years several datasets have
been proposed for visual question answering [26, 3, 12, 44,
31, 47, 34, 21, 18, 37]. The DAQUAR dataset [26] includes
template-based and natural questions for a set of indoor
[3] proposed the VQA dataset, which is two or-
scenes.
ders of magnitude larger than DAQUAR and includes more
diverse images and less constrained answers. FM-IQA [12]
is another dataset that includes multi-lingual questions and
answers. Visual Madlibs [44], constructs ﬁll-in-the-blank
templates for natural language descriptions. COCO-QA
[31] is constructed automatically by converting image de-
scriptions to questions. The idea of Visual 7W [47] is to
provide object-level grounding for question-answer pairs as
opposed to image-level associations between images and
QA pairs. Visual Genome [21] provides dense annota-
tions for image regions, attributes, relationships, etc. and
provide free-form and region-based QA pairs for each im-
age. MovieQA [34] is a movie-based QA dataset, where
the QAs are based on information in the video clips, subti-
tles, scripts, etc. CLEVR [18] is a synthetic VQA dataset
that mainly targets visual reasoning abilities.
In contrast
to all these datasets, we focus on questions that cannot be
answered by the information in the associated image and
require external knowledge to be answered.

Most similar to our dataset is FVQA [37]. While that
work also tackles the difﬁcult problem of creating a VQA
dataset requiring outside knowledge, their method annotates
questions by selecting a fact (a knowledge triplet such as
“dog is mammal") from a ﬁxed knowledge base. While this
dataset is still quite useful for testing methods’ ability to in-
corporate a knowledge base into a VQA system, our dataset
tests methods’ ability to retrieve relevant facts from the web,
from a database, or some other source of knowledge that
was not used to create the questions. Another issue is that
triplets are not sufﬁcient to represent general knowledge.

Building knowledge bases & Knowledge-based reason-
ing. Several knowledge bases have been created using vi-
sual data or for visual reasoning tasks [46, 8, 10, 32, 49, 48].
These knowledge bases are potentially helpful resources
for answering questions in our dataset. Knowledge-based

NLP community (e.g., [5, 43, 42, 6, 33, 22, 7]).

3. OK-VQA Dataset

In this section we explain how we collect a dataset which
better measures performance of VQA systems requiring ex-
ternal knowledge. The common VQA datasets such as
[3, 14] do not require much knowledge to answer a large
majority of the questions. The dataset mostly contains ques-
tions such as “How many apples are there?”, “What animal
is this?”, and “What color is the bowl?”. While these are
perfectly reasonable tasks for open-ended visual recogni-
tion, they do not test our algorithms’ ability to reason about
a scene or draw on information outside of the image. Thus,
for our goal of combining visual recognition with informa-
tion extraction from sources outside the image, we would
not be able to evaluate knowledge-based systems as most
questions do not require outside knowledge.

To see this speciﬁcally, we examine the “age annota-
tions” that are provided for 10,000 questions in the VQA
dataset [1]. For each question and image pair, an MTurk
worker was asked how old someone would need to be to
answer the question. While this is not a perfect metric, it
is a reasonable approximation of the difﬁculty of a ques-
tion and how much a person would have to know to an-
swer a question. The analysis shows that more than 78% of
the questions can be answered by people who are 10 years
old or younger. This suggests that very little background
knowledge is actually required to answer the vast majority

of these questions.

Given that current VQA datasets do not test exactly what
we are looking for, we collect a new dataset. We use ran-
dom images from the COCO dataset [24], using the origi-
nal 80k-40k training and validation splits for our train and
test splits. The visual complexity of these images compared
to other datasets make them ideal for labeling knowledge-
based questions.

In the ﬁrst round of labeling, we asked MTurk workers to
write a question given an image. Similar to [3], we prompt
users to come up with questions to fool a “smart robot.”
We also ask in the instructions that the question should be
related to the image content. In addition, we prompt users
not to ask what is in an image, or how many of something
there is, and specify that the question should require some
outside knowledge. In a second round of labeling, we asked
5 different MTurk workers to label each question-image pair
with an answer.

Although this prompt yielded many high-quality ques-
tions, it also yielded a lot of low quality questions, for ex-
ample, ones that asked basic questions such as counting,
did not require looking at the image, or were nonsensical.
To ensure that the dataset asked these difﬁcult knowledge-
requiring questions, the MTurk provided questions were
manually ﬁltered to get only questions requiring knowl-
edge. From a pool of 86,700 questions, we ﬁltered down
to 34,921 questions.

One more factor to consider was the potential bias in
the dataset. As discussed in many works, including [14],

the VQAv1 dataset had a lot of bias. Famously, questions
beginning with “Is there a ...” had a very strong bias to-
wards “Yes.” Similarly, in our unﬁltered dataset, there were
a lot of questions with a bias towards certain answers. For
instance, in a lot of images where there is snowfall, the
question would ask “What season is it?” Although there
were other images (such as ones with deciduous trees with
multi-colored leaves) with different answers, there was a
clear bias towards “winter.” To alleviate this problem, for
train and test, we removed questions so that the answer dis-
tribution was uniform; speciﬁcally, we removed questions
if there were more than 5 instances of that answer as the
most common answer. This had the effect of removing a
lot of the answer bias. It also had the effect of making the
dataset harder by limiting the number of times VQA algo-
rithms would see questions with a particular answer, mak-
ing outside information more important. We also removed
questions which had no inter-annotator agreement on the
answer. Performing this ﬁltering brought us down to 9,009
questions in train and 5,046 questions in test for a total of
14,055 questions.

Figure 2 shows some of the collected questions, images,
and answers from our dataset. More will be provided in
the supplementary material. You can see that these ques-
tions require at least one piece of background knowledge
to answer. For instance, in the bottom left question, the
system needs to recognize that the image is of a christian
church and know that those churches hold religious services
on Sundays. That latter piece of knowledge should be ob-
tained from external knowledge resources, and it cannot be
inferred from the image and question alone.

4. Dataset Statistics

In this section, we explore the statistical properties of
our dataset, and compare to other visual question answering
datasets to show that our dataset is diverse, difﬁcult, and, to

the best of our knowledge, the largest VQA dataset speciﬁ-
cally targeted for knowledge-based VQA on natural scenes.

Knowledge category. Requiring knowledge for VQA is a
good start, but there are many different types of knowledge
that humans have about the world that could come into play.
There is common-sense knowledge: water is wet, couches
are found in living rooms. There is geographical knowl-
edge:
the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, scientiﬁc knowledge:
humans have 23 chromosomes, and historical knowledge:
George Washington is the ﬁrst U.S. president. To get a bet-
ter understanding of the kinds of knowledge our dataset re-
quires, we asked ﬁve MTurk workers to annotate each ques-
tion as belonging to one of ten categories of knowledge that
we speciﬁed: Vehicles and Transportation; Brands, Compa-
nies and Products; Objects, Materials and Clothing; Sports
and Recreation; Cooking and Food; Geography, History,
Language and Culture; People and Everyday Life, Plants
and Animals; Science and Technology; and Weather and
Climate. If no one category had a plurality of workers, it
was categorized as “Other". This also ensured that the ﬁnal
category labels are mutually exclusive. We show the distri-
bution of questions across categories in Figure 3.

Comparison with other VQA datasets. In Table 1 we look
at a number of other visual question answering datasets and
compare them to our dataset in a number of different ways.
In the top section, we look at a number of datasets which
do not explicitly try to include a knowledge component in-
cluding the ubiquitous VQAv2 dataset [14], the ﬁrst ver-
sion of which was one of the ﬁrst datasets to investigate
visual question answering. Compared to these datasets, we
have a comparable number of questions to DAQUAR [26]
as well as MovieQA [34], and many more questions than
knowledge-based datasets KB-VQA [36] and FVQA [37].
We have fewer questions compared to CLEVR [18] where
the images, questions and answers are automatically gen-
erated, as well compared to more large-scale human an-
notated visual datasets such as VQAv2 [14], and Visual

categories. We show the percentage of questions falling

Madlibs [44]. Since we manually ﬁltered our dataset to
avoid the pitfalls of other datasets and to ensure our ques-
tions are knowledge-based and because we ﬁltered down
common answers to emphasize the long tail of answers, our
dataset is more time-intensive and expensive to collect. We
trade off size in this case for knowledge and difﬁculty.

We can see from the average question lengths and av-
erage answer lengths that our questions and answers are
about comparable to KB-VQA [36] and FVQA [37] and
longer than the other VQA datasets with the exception of
DAQUAR and CLEVR (which are partially and fully auto-
mated from templates respectively). This makes sense since
we would expect knowledge-based questions to be longer as
they are typically not able to be as short as common ques-
tions in other datasets such as “How many objects are in the
image?” or “What color is the couch?”.

Question statistics. We also collected statistics for our
dataset by looking at the number of questions, and by look-
ing at which were most frequent for each knowledge cate-
gory. OK-VQA has 12,591 unique questions out of 14,055
total, and 7,178 unique question words. This indicates that
we get a variety of different questions and answers in our
dataset. We also looked at the variety of images in our
dataset. As we stated earlier, our images come from the
COCO image dataset, so our dataset contains the same ba-
sic distribution of images. However, we only use a subset
of COCO images, so we want to see if we still get a wide
distribution of images. For this, we ran a Places2 [45] clas-
siﬁer on our images and looked at the top-1 scene class for
each image and compared that to COCO overall. Out of 365
scenes, our dataset contains all but 5 classes: hunting lodge,
mansion, movie theater, ruin and volcano. These classes ap-
pear infrequently in the overall COCO dataset (10, 22, 28,

37 and 25 times respectively), so overall, we still captured
quite a lot of the variation in scenes.

Finally, we show in Figure 4 the question words and an-
swers in each category that are the most “unique” to get
a better idea of what types of questions we have in each
of these categories. We calculate these for each knowl-
edge category by looking at the number of appearances
within the category over the total number in the dataset
to see which question words and answers had the highest
relative frequency in their category. When looking at the
question words, we see words speciﬁc to categories such
as bus in Vehicles and Transportation, sandwich in Cook-
ing and Food, and clouds in Weather and Climate. We also
see that the answers are also extremely related to each cat-
egory, such as herbivore in Plants and Animals, and umpire
in Sports and Recreation. In the supplemental material, we
also show the most common question words and answers.

ing knowledge-based ones.

MUTAN [4]: Multimodal Tucker Fusion (MUTAN)
model [4], a recent state-of-the-art tensor-based method for
VQA. Speciﬁcally, we use the attention version of MUTAN,
and choose the parameters to match the single best perform-
ing model of [4].

BAN [20]: Bilinear Attention Networks for VQA. A re-
cent state-of-the art VQA method that uses a co-attention
mechanism between the question features and the bottom-
up detection features of the image. We modify some hy-
perparameters to improve performance on our dataset (see
supplemental material).

MLP: The MLP has 3 hidden layers with ReLU activa-
tions and hidden size 2048 that concatenates the image and
question features after a skip-thought GRU after one fully
connected layer each. Like MUTAN, it uses fc7 features
from ResNet-152.

Q-Only: The same model as MLP, but only takes the

question features.

ArticleNet (AN): We consider a simple knowledge-
based baseline that we refer to as ArticleNet. The idea is
to retrieve some articles from Wikipedia for each question-
image pair and then train a network to ﬁnd the answer in the
retrieved articles.

Retrieving articles is composed of three steps. First, we
collect possible search queries for each question-image pair.
We come up with all possible queries for each question by
combining words from the question and words that are iden-
tiﬁed by pre-trained image and scene classiﬁers. Second,
we use the Wikipedia search API to get the top retrieved ar-
ticle for each query. Third, for each query and article, we
extract a small subset of each article that is most relevant
for the query by selecting the sentences within the article
that best correspond to our query based on the frequency of
those query words in the sentence.

Once the sentences have been retrieved, the next step is
to ﬁlter and encode them for use in VQA. Speciﬁcally, we
train ArticleNet to predict whether and where the ground

truth answers appear in the article and in each sentence. The
architecture is shown in Figure 5. To ﬁnd the answer to a
question, we pick the top scoring word among the retrieved
sentences. More speciﬁcally, we take the highest value of
awi .asent, where awi is the score for the word being the
answer and asent is the score for the sentence including the
answer.

For a more detailed description of ArticleNet see the sup-

plementary material.

MUTAN + AN: We augment MUTAN with the top sen-
tence hidden states (hsent in Figure 5) from ArticleNet
(AN). During VQA training and testing, we take the top
predicted sentences (ignoring duplicate sentences), and feed
them in the memory of an end-to-end memory network [33].
The output of the memory network is concatenated with the
output of the ﬁrst MUTAN fusion layer.

BAN + AN: Similarly, we incorporate the ArticleNet
hidden states into BAN and incorporate it
into VQA
pipeline with another memory network. We concatenate
output of the memory network with the BAN hidden state
right before the ﬁnal classiﬁcation network. See the supple-
mental material for details.

MUTAN/AN oracle: As an upper bound check, and to
see potentially how much VQA models could beneﬁt from
the knowledge retrieved using ArticleNet, we also provide
results on an oracle, which simply takes the raw ArticleNet
and MUTAN predictions, taking the best answer (compar-
ing to ground truth) from either.

BAN/AN oracle: Similar to the MUTAN/AN oracle, but
we take the best answer from the raw ArticleNet and BAN
instead, again taking the best answer for each question.
Benchmark results. We report the results using the com-
mon VQA evaluation metric [3], but use each of our an-
swer annotations twice, since we have 5 answer annotations
versus 10 in [3]. We also stem the answers using Porter
stemming to consolidate answers that are identical except
for pluralization and conjugation as in [37]. We also show
the breakdowns for each of our knowledge categories. The

Figure 5: ArticleNet architecture. ArticleNet takes in the question Q and visual features V . All modules within the dotted
line box share weights. The output of the GRUs is used to classify each word as the answer or not awi . The ﬁnal GRU hidden
states htitle and hsent are put through fully connected layers to predict if the answer is in the sentence asent or title atitle,
and then are combined together and used to classify if the answer is in the article aart.

results are reported in Table 2.

The ﬁrst observation is that no method gets close to num-
bers on standard VQA dataset such as VQA [14] (where
the best real open-ended result for the 2018 competition
is 72.41). Moreover, state-of-the-art models such as MU-
TAN [4] and BAN [20], which are speciﬁcally designed for
VQA to learn high-level associations between the image
and question, get far worse numbers on our dataset. This
suggests that OK-VQA cannot be solved simply by coming
up with a clever model, but actually requires methods that
incorporate information from outside the image.

It is interesting to note that although the performance of
the raw ArticleNet is low, it provides improvement when
combined with the state-of-the-art models (MUTAN + AN
and BAN + AN). From the oracle numbers, we can see
that the knowledge retrieved by ArticleNet provides com-
plementary information to the state-of-the-art VQA models.
These oracles are optimistic upper bounds using ArticleNet,
but they show that smarter knowledge-retrieval approaches
could have stronger performance on our dataset. Note that
ArticleNet is not directly trained on VQA and can only pre-
dict answers within the articles it has retrieved. So the rela-
tively low performance on VQA is not surprising.

Looking at the category breakdowns, we see that Arti-
cleNet is particularly helpful for brands, science, and cook-
ing categories, perhaps suggesting that these categories are
better represented in Wikipedia.
It should be noted that
the major portion of our dataset requires knowledge outside
Wikipedia such as commonsense or visual knowledge.

The Q-Only baseline performs signiﬁcantly worse than

the other VQA baselines, suggesting that visual features are
indeed necessary and our procedure for reducing answer
bias was effective.

Visual feature ablation. We also want to demonstrate the
difﬁculty of the dataset from the perspective of visual fea-
tures, so we show MUTAN results using different ResNet
architectures. The previously reported result for MUTAN
is based on ResNet152. We also show the results using ex-
tracted features from ResNet50 and ResNet18 in Table 3.
From this table it can be seen that going from ResNet50
to ResNet152 features only has a marginal improvement,
and similarly going from ResNet18 to ResNet50. How-
ever, going from ResNet18 to no image (Q-Only) causes
a large drop in performance. This suggests that our dataset
is indeed visually grounded, but better image features do
not hugely improve the results, suggesting the difﬁculty lies
in the retrieving the relevant knowledge and reasoning re-
quired to answer the questions.

Scale ablation. Finally, we investigate the degree to which
the size of our dataset relates to its difﬁculty as opposed to
the nature of the questions themselves. We ﬁrst take a ran-

dom subdivision of our training set and train MUTAN on
progressively smaller subsets of the training data and eval-
uate on our original test set. Figure 7 shows the results.
Qualitative examples. We show some qualitative examples
in Figure 6 to see how outside knowledge helps VQA sys-
tems in a few examples. We compare MUTAN+AN method
with MUTAN. The left example asks what “fruit family” the
fruit in the image (oranges) comes from. We see that two
sentences that directly contain the information that oranges
are citrus fruits are retrieved —“The orange ...
is a fruit
of the citrus species” and “The citrus sinensis is subdivided
into four classes [including] common oranges”.

The middle example asks what liquid the animal (cow)
produces. The ﬁrst and third sentences tell us that cows
produce milk, and the second sentence tells us that milk is
a liquid. This gives the combined MUTAN+AN method
enough information to correctly answer milk.

The example on the right asks how many chromosomes
humans have. It is somewhat ambiguous whether it means
how many individual chromosomes or how many pairs, so
workers labeled both as answers. The retrieved articles are
helpful here, retrieving two different articles referring to 23
pairs of chromosomes and 46 chromosomes total. The com-
bined MUTAN+AN method correctly answers 23, while
MUTAN guesses 3.

6. Conclusion

We address the task of knowledge-based visual ques-
tion answering. We introduce a novel benchmark called
OK-VQA for this task. Unlike the common VQA bench-
marks, the information provided in the question and the cor-
responding images of OK-VQA is not sufﬁcient to answer
the questions, and answering the questions requires reason-

ing on external knowledge resources. We show that the
performance of state-of-the-art VQA models signiﬁcantly
drops on OK-VQA. We analyze the properties and statistics
of the dataset and show that background knowledge can im-
prove results on our dataset. Our experimental evaluations
show that the proposed benchmark is quite challenging and
that there is a large room for improvement.
