Abstract

Capturing the interesting components of an image is a
key aspect of image understanding. When a speaker anno-
tates an image, selecting labels that are informative greatly
depends on the prior knowledge of a prospective listener.
Motivated by cognitive theories of categorization and com-
munication, we present a new unsupervised approach to
model this prior knowledge and quantify the informative-
ness of a description. Speciﬁcally, we compute how knowl-
edge of a label reduces uncertainty over the space of labels
and use this uncertainty reduction to rank candidate labels
for describing an image. While the full estimation prob-
lem is intractable, we describe an efﬁcient algorithm to ap-
proximate entropy reduction using a tree-structured graph-
ical model. We evaluate our approach on the open-images
dataset using a new evaluation set of 10K ground-truth rat-
ings and ﬁnd that it achieves ∼ 65% agreement with human
raters, close to the upper bound of inter-rater agreement
and largely outperforming other unsupervised baselines.

1. Introduction

How would you label the photo in Figure 1? If you
answered “a dog”, your response agrees with what most
people would answer.
Indeed, people are surprisingly
consistent when asked to describe what an image is
“about” [16]. They intuitively manage to focus on what is
“informative” or “relevant” and select terms that reﬂect this
information. In contrast, automated classiﬁers can produce
a large number of labels that are perhaps technically
correct, but are often non-interesting (Fig. 1 top right).

A natural approach to ascertain importance lies in the
context of the speciﬁc task. For instance, classiﬁers can be
efﬁciently trained to identify dog breeds or animal species.
More generally, each task deﬁnes importance through a su-
pervision signal provided to the classiﬁer [1, 20, 14]. Here
we are interested in a more generic setup, where no down-
stream task dictates the scene interpretation. This represents
the challenge that people face when describing a scene to
another person, without any speciﬁc task at hand.

Figure 1. The problem of informative labeling. An image is au-
tomatically annotated with multiple labels. A “speaker” is then
given these labels and their conﬁdence scores and has to select k
labels to transmit to a listener, such that the listener ﬁnds them
informative given his prior knowledge. The prior knowledge is
assumed to be common to both the speaker and the listener.

The principles that govern informative communication
have long been a subject of research in various ﬁelds from
philosophy of language and linguistics to computer science.
In the discipline of pragmatics, Grice’s maxims state that
“one tries to be as informative as one possibly can.” [9]. But
the question remains, “Informative about what?” How can
we build a practical theory of informative communication
that can be applied to concrete problems with real-world
data?

In this paper, we address the following concrete learning
setup (Figure 1). A speaker receives a set of labels pre-
dicted automatically from an image by a multiclass classi-
ﬁer. It also receives the conﬁdence that the classiﬁer assigns
to each prediction. Then, it aims to select a few labels (say,
one label) to be transmitted to a listener, such that the lis-
tener will ﬁnd those labels informative. The speaker and
listener also share the same prior knowledge in the form of
the distribution of labels in the image dataset.

select terms to describe an image. The key idea is that
communicated terms are aimed to reduce the uncertainty
that a listener has about the semantic space. We show how
this “theory-of-mind” can be quantitatively computed using
information-theoretic measures. In contrast with previous
approaches that focused on visual aspects and their impor-
tance [8, 2, 18, 13, 3], our measures focus on information
about the semantics of labels.

To compute information content of a label, we build a
probabilistic model of the full label space and use it to quan-
tify how transmitting a label reduces uncertainty. Specif-
ically, we compute the entropy of the label distribution as
a measure of uncertainty, and also quantify how much this
entropy is reduced when a label is set to be true.

Importantly, computing these measures over the full dis-
tribution of labels is not feasible because it requires to ag-
gregate an exponentially-large set of label combinations.
We show how the entropy and other information theoretic
measures can be computed efﬁciently by approximating the
full joint distribution with a tree-structured graphical model
(a Chow-Liu tree). We then treat entropy-reduction as a
scoring function that allows us to rank all labels of an im-
age, and select those that reduce the entropy most. We name
this approach IOTA, for Informative Object Annotations.

We test this approach on a new evaluation dataset: 10K
images from the open-images dataset [11] were annotated
with informative labels by three raters each. We ﬁnd that
human annotations are in strong agreement (∼ 65%) with
the uncertainty-reduction measures, just shy of inter-rater
agreement and superior to 4 other unsupervised baselines.

Our main contributions are:

(1) We describe a novel
learning setup of selecting important labels without di-
rect supervision about importance.
(2) We develop an
information-theoretic framework to address this task, and
design scoring functions that can be used to solve it. (3) We
further describe an efﬁcient algorithm for computing these
scoring functions, by approximating the label distribution
using a tree-structured graphical model. (4) We provide a
new evaluation set of ground-truth importance ratings based
on 10K images from the open-images dataset. (5) We show
that IOTA achieves high agreement with human judgment
on this dataset.

Learning a measure of importance over the space of vi-
sual labels could have wide implications as it allows us to
automate what until now required costly human evaluation.
By focusing on labels that matter to people, one could, for
example, design more relevant loss functions and evaluation
metrics for object recognition or steer image captioning to-
ward meaningful descriptions.

2. Related work

Image importance and object saliency. The problem of
deciding which components in an image are important has
been studied intensively. The main approaches involved
identifying characteristics of objects and images that could
contribute to importance, and use labeled data for predicting
object importance. Elazary and Itti [8] considered the or-
der of object naming in the LabelMe dataset [17] as a mea-
sure of the interest of an object and compare that to salient
locations predicted by computational models of bottom-up
attention. The elegant work of Spain and Perona [18] ex-
amined which factors can predict the order in which objects
[2] char-
will be mentioned given an image. Berg et al.
acterized factors related to semantics, to composition and
to the likelihood of attribute-object, and investigated how
these affected the measures of importance. [15] focused on
predicting entry-level classes using a supervised approach.
These studies also make it clear that the object saliency is
strongly correlated with its perceived importance [13, 3].

These studies differ from the current work in two signif-
icant ways. First, they largely focus on visual properties of
objects in images, while our current approach focuses on
modeling the labels structure, and only uses image-based
information in the form of label conﬁdence as predicted by
a classiﬁer. Second, they largely take a supervised approach
using measures of importance in a training set to build pre-
dictive models of label importance.
In contrast, our ap-
proach is unsupervised, because our model is not directly
exposed to labeled information about object importance.

Information theory and measures of relevance The prob-
lem of extracting informative components from a com-
plex signal was studied from an information-theoretic per-
spective through the information bottleneck principle (IB)
[19, 4, 23]. In contrast to the current work, in IB, a signal,
X, is compressed into T such that it maximizes information
about another variable Y , that can be viewed as a supervi-
sion variable. In [12], information gain was used to select
questions in a goal-oriented dialog setup.

Pragmatics, Relevance theory.
In pragmatics, effective
communication has been characterized by the cooperative
principle [9], which views communication as a cooperative
interaction between a speaker and a listener. These prin-
ciples were phrased in Grice’s maxims, stating that “one
tries to be as informative as one possibly can” and “does
not give information that is false or that is not supported by
evidence”. Our approach provides a concrete quantitative
realization to these principles.
Inspired by Grice’s work,
Sperber and Wilson proposed a framework called relevance
theory [21, 22]. They highlighted that a speaker provides
cues to a listener, who then interprets them in the context of
what she already knows and what the speaker may intended
to transmit.

3. Our approach

The key idea of our approach is to quantify the relevant-
information content of a message, by modelling what the
listener does not know, and ﬁnd labels that reduce this un-
certainty. To illustrate the idea, consider a label that ap-
pears in most of the images in a dataset (e.g., nature). If the
speaker selects to transmit that label, it provides very little
information to the listener, because they can already assume
that a given image is annotated with that label. In contrast, if
the speaker transmits a label that is less common, appearing
in only half of the images, more of the listener’s uncertainty
would be removed.

A more important property of multi-label uncertainty is
that labels are interdependent:
transmitting one label can
reduce the uncertainty of others. This property is evi-
dent when considering label hierarchy, for example, golden-
retriever = true implies that dog = true. As a result transmit-
ting a ﬁne-grained label removes more entropy than a more
general label. Very importantly however, this effect is not
limited to hierarchical relations. For instance, because the
label street tends to co-occur with car and other vehicles,
transmitting street would reduce the overall uncertainty by
reducing uncertainty in correlated co-occurring terms.

Going beyond these examples, we aim to calculate how
a revealed label affects the listener’s uncertainty. For this
purpose, the Shannon entropy is a natural choice to quan-
tify uncertainty, pending that we can estimate the prior joint
distribution of labels. Clearly, modelling the entire prior
knowledge about the visual world of a listener is beyond our
current reach. Instead, we show how we can approximate
the entire joint distribution by building a compact graphi-
cal model with a tree structure. This allows us to efﬁciently
compute properties of the joint distribution over labels and
more speciﬁcally, estimate listener uncertainty and label-
conditioned uncertainty.

We start by describing an information-theoretic approach
for selecting informative labels by estimating uncertainty
and label-conditioned uncertainty. We then describe an al-
gorithm to effectively compute these quantities in practice.

3.1. The problem setup

Assume that we are given a corpus of images, each an-
notated with multiple labels from a vocabulary of d terms
L = (l1, ..., ld). Since we operate in a noisy labeling
setup, we treat the labels as binary random variables li ∈
{true, f alse}. We also assume that for each image I, la-
bels are accompanied with a score reﬂecting the classiﬁer’s
conﬁdence in that label, which we denote by q(li|I). Such
conﬁdence scores can be obtained from classiﬁer predic-
tions, assuming that these conﬁdence scores are calibrated,
namely, reﬂect the true fraction of correct labels. In prac-

tice, many large-scale models indeed calibrate their scores,
as we discuss in the experimental section. The goal of the
speaker is to select k labels to be transmitted to the listener,
such that they are most “useful” or informative.

3.2. Information theoretic measure of importance

Let us ﬁrst assume that we can estimate the distribution
over labels that a listener has in mind. Clearly, this is a
major assumption, and we discuss below how we relax this
assumption and approximate this distribution. Given this
distribution, we wish to measure the uncertainty it reﬂects,
as well as how much this uncertainty is reduced when the
speaker reveals a speciﬁc label. A principled measure of the
uncertainty about random variables is the Shannon entropy
of their joint distribution H(L1, ..., Ld) [6]. We use a nota-
tion that makes it explicit that the entropy depends on the
distribution, where the entropy is deﬁned as

H[p(l1, ..., ld)] = −Xl1,...,ld

p(l1, ..., ld) log p(l1, ..., ld).

(1)

Here, summation is over all possible assignments of the d
labels, an exponential number of terms that cannot be com-
puted in practice. We show below how to approximate it.

The amount of entropy that is reduced when the speaker

transmits a subset of the labels L′ = {li, lj, lk, . . .}, is

∆H(L′) = H[p(l1, ..., ld)] − H[p(l1, ..., ld|L′ = true)]

,

where L′ = true means that all labels in L′ are assigned
a true value. For simplicity, we focus here on the case of
transmitting a single label li (see also [7]), and deﬁne the
per-label entropy-reduction

∆H(i) = H[p(l1, ..., ld)] − H[p(l1, ..., ld|li = true)].

(2)

interesting properties.

This measure has several

It
has a similar form to the Shannon mutual information,
M I(X; Y ) = H(X) − H(X|Y ), which is always positive.
However, the condition on the second term is only over a
single value of the label (li = true). As a result, Eq. (2) can
obtain both negative and positive values. When the random
variables are independent, ∆H(i) is always positive, be-
cause the entropy can be factored using the chain rule, and

obeys H(L1, ..., Ld) − H(L1, ..., Ld|Li) =Pj6=i H(Lj) >

0 (Sec 2.5 [6]). However, when the variables are not inde-
pendent, collapsing one variable to a True value can actually
increase the entropy of other co-dependant variables. As an
intuitive example, the base probability of observing a lion
in a city is very low, and has low entropy. However, once
you see a sign “zoo”, the entropy of facing a lion rises.

The second important property of ∆H(i) is that it is
completely agnostic to the image and only depends on the
label distribution. To capture image-speciﬁc label rele-
vance, we note that the accuracy of annotating an image

Figure 2. Uncertainty over labels can be estimated through measuring the entropy of its joint distribution, and computed efﬁciently
using a tree-structured probabilistic graphical model (PGM). (a) An image corpus is used for collecting pairwise label co-occurrence.
Then, a tree-structured graphical model is learned using the Chow-Liu algorithm. Computing the entropy of the approximated distribution
ˆp has a run-time that is linear in the number of labels. (b) To compute the entropy conditioned on a label ldog = true, the marginal of

with a label may strongly depend on the image. For exam-
ple, some images may have key aspects of the object oc-
cluded. We therefore wish to compute the expected reduc-
tion in entropy based on the likelihood that a label is correct
q(li|I). When an incorrect label is transmitted, we assume
here that no information is passed to the listener (there is
an interesting research question about negative information
value in this case, which is outside the scope of this paper).
The expected entropy-reduction is therefore

E(∆H) = q(li|I)∆H + (1 − q(li|I)) · 0

this expectation is equivalent to the conﬁdence-weighted
entropy reduction measure:

cw-∆H(i) = q(li|I) [H(L) − H[L|li = true])]

,

(3)

where q(li|I) is the probability that li is correct and L is a
random variable that holds the distribution of all labels. We
propose that this is a good measure of label information in
the context of a corpus.

3.3. Other measures of informative labels

Conﬁdence-weighted entropy reduction, Eq. (3), is an
intuitive quantiﬁcation of label informativeness, but other
properties of the label distribution may capture aspects of
label importance. We now discuss two such measures: in-
formation about images, and probabilistic surprise.

images.

Information about
Informative labels were
studied in the context of an image reference game. In this
setup, a speaker provides labels about an image, and a lis-
tener needs to identify the target image among a set of dis-
tractor images. Recent versions used natural language cap-
tioning for the same purpose [1, 20].

It is natural to deﬁne entropy-reduction for that setup.
Similar to Eq. (2), compute the difference between the
full entropy over images, and the entropy after transmit-
ting a label. When the distribution over images is uni-
form the entropy reduction is simply log(num. images) −

log(num. matching images), where the second term is the
number of images annotated by a label. Considering the
conﬁdence of a label we obtain

cw-Image∆H(i) = q(li|I) [log(q(li)]

,

(4)

where q(li|I) is again the probability that li is correct and
q(li) is the fraction of images with the label i. This measure
is fundamentally different from Eq. (3) in that it focuses
on the distribution of labels over images, not their on joint
distribution.

Probabilistic surprise. Transmitting a label changes the
label distribution, the “belief” of the listener. This change
can be quantiﬁed by the Kullback-Liebler divergence of the
label distribution with and without transmission:

cw-DKL(i)=q(li|I)DKL(p(l1, ..., ld|li=true)||p(l1, ..., ld)) .
(5)
We can use this measure as a scoring function to rank
labels by how strongly they affect the distribution. As
in the entropy reduction approach (Eq. 3), here we ex-
ploit the cross-label relationships but provide a different
information-theoretic measure for how transmitting a label
affects the distribution.

Entropy reduction in a singleton model. An interesting
approximation to the joint distribution used in Eq. (1) is
provided by the singleton model, which models the joint
distribution as the product of the marginals p(l1, ..., ld) =

Qi p(li). Here, the joint entropy is simply the sum of per-

label entropies. The entropy reduced when transmitting a
label is simply its entropy cw-Singleton(i) = q(li|I)H(li).
Importantly, entropy reduction in this model ignores inter-
label relationships.

The entropy is a function that grows monotonically with
p for (p < 0.5). This means that if all labels are rare (p <
0.5), then ranking labels by their empirical frequency, yields
the same ranking as by their singleton entropy reduction.

Given a corpus of images, we wish to compute the joint
distribution of label co-occurrence in an image p(l1, ..., ld).
The scoring functions described above assume that we can
estimate and represent the joint distribution over labels. Un-
fortunately, even for a modest vocabulary size d, the distri-
bution cannot be estimated in practice since it has 2d param-
eters. Instead, we approximate the label distribution using
a probabilistic graphical model called a Chow-Liu tree [5].
We ﬁrst describe the graphical model, and then how it is
learned from data.

As any probabilistic graphical model, A Chow-Liu tree
has two components: First, a tree G(V, E) with d nodes
and d − 1 edges, where the nodes V correspond to the d
labels, and the edges E connect the nodes to form a fully-
connected tree. The tree is directed, and each node li, ex-
cept a single root node, has a single parent node lj .

As a second component, every edge in the graph, con-
necting nodes i and j is accompanied by a conditional dis-
tribution, p(li|parent(li)). Note that this conditional dis-
tribution involves only two binary variables, namely a total
of four parameters. The full model therefore has only O(d)
parameters and can be estimate efﬁciently from data. With
these two components, the Chow-Liu model can be used to
represent a joint distribution over all labels, which factor-
izes over the graph

log p(l1, ..., ld) =

d

Xi=1

log p(cid:0)li|lparent(i)(cid:1) .

(6)

While any tree structure can be used to represent a factored
distribution as in Eq. (6), the Chow-Liu algorithm ﬁnds one
speciﬁc tree structure: The distribution that is closest to
the original full distribution terms of the Kullback-Liebler
divergence DKL( ˆp(L)||p(L)). That tree is found in two
steps: First, for every pair of labels i, j, compute their 2 × 2
joint distribution in the image corpus, then compute the mu-
tual information of that distribution.

M Iij = Xli=T ,F Xlj =T ,F

pij(li, lj)

pij(li, lj)
pi(li)pj(lj)

(7)

where the summation is over all combination of True and
False value for the two variables, pij is the joint distribution
over label co-occurrence, and pi and pj are the marginals of
that distribution.

As a second step, assign M Iij as the weight of the edge
connecting the nodes of labels i and j and ﬁnd the maxi-
mum spanning tree on the weighted graph. Importantly, the
particular directions of the edges of the model are not im-
portant. Any set of directions that forms a consistent tree
(having at most one parent per node), deﬁnes the same dis-
tribution over the graph [5]. In practice, since committing

to a single tree may be sensitive to small perturbations in
the data, we model the distribution as a mixture of k trees,
which are created by a bootstrap procedure.

Representing the joint distribution of labels using a tree
provides great computationally beneﬁts, since many prop-
erties of the distribution can be computed very efﬁciently.
Importantly, when the joint distribution factorizes over a
tree, the entropy can be computed exactly using the entropy
chain rule:

H[p(li|A(li))],

H[p(l1, ..., ld)] = H" d
Yi=1

p(li|A(li))# =

d

Xi=1

(8)
where A(li) is the parent of the label li. We abused the no-
tation slightly, the root node does not have a parent hence
its entropy is not conditioned on a parent but should be
H[p(lroot)].

Furthermore, in a tree-structured probabilistic model,
one can redirect the edges by selecting any node to be a root,
and conditioning all other nodes accordingly [10]. This al-
lows us to compute the labeled-conditioned entropy using
the following steps. First, given a new root label li, iter-
atively redirect all edges in the tree to make all nodes its
descendents. Update the conditional density tables on the
edges. Second, assign a marginal distribution of [0, 1] to the
node li, reﬂecting the fact that the label is assigned to be
true. Third, propagate the distribution throughout the graph
using the conditional probability functions on the edges. Fi-
nally, compute the entropy of the new distribution using the
chain rule as in Eq. (8).

3.5. Selecting labels for transmission

Given the above model, we can compute the expected
entropy reduction for each label for a given image. We then
take an information-retrieval perspective, rank the labels by
their scores and emit the highest rank label.

This process can be repeated for transmitting multiple
labels. For example, given that label li was transmitted ﬁrst,
we compute how much each of the remaining labels reduces
the entropy further. Formally, to decide about a second label
to transmit, we compute for every label lj 6= li:

∆Hi(j) = H[p(l1, ..., ld|li = true)]

(9)

−H[p(l1, ..., ld|li = true, lj = true)]

Intuitively, selecting a second label that maximizes this
score tends to select labels that are semantically remote
from the ﬁrst emitted labels. If a second label (say, lj =pet)
is semantically similar to the ﬁrst label (say, li =dog), the
residual entropy of pet after observing the label dog is low,
hence the speaker will prefer other labels.

notations by the compared
approaches.
Labels are
ranked based on the score
functions. Then, the position
(namely, k) of the ground-
truth label (in bold) is used to
compute precision and recall.
Later, precision and recall are
averaged across images.

4. Experiments

4.1. Data

We tested IOTA on the open-images dataset (OID) [11].
In OID, each image is annotated with a list of labels, to-
gether with a conﬁdence score. We approximate the joint la-
bel distribution over the validation set (41,620 images anno-
tated with 512,093 labels) and also over the test set (125,436
images annotated with 1,545,835 labels).

Ground-truth data (OID-IOTA-10K). We collected a
new dataset of ground-truth “informative” labels for 10K
images: 2500 from OID-validation and 7500 from OID-
test, 3 raters per image. Raters were instructed to focus
on the object or scene that is dominant in the image and
to avoid overly generic terms that are not particularly de-
scriptive (“a picture”). Labels were entered as free text,
and when possible, matched in real time to the predeﬁned
OID knowledge graph (64% of samples) so raters can ver-
ify label meaning. The remaining 36% of annotations were
matched as a post-process, which included stemming, re-
solving ambiguities (e.g. deciding if a bat meant the animal
or the sport equipment) and resolving synonyms (e.g. pants
and trousers). Overall, in many cases raters used exactly
the same term to describe an image. In 68% of the images
at least two raters described the image with the same la-
bel, and in 27% all three raters agreed. The data is publicly
available at https://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/ brachalior/IOTA/.

Label co-occurrence. OID lists labels whose conﬁdence
is above 0.5. All labels with at least 300 appearances were
considered when collecting the label distribution, ignoring
their conﬁdence. This yielded a vocabulary of 772 labels.
See supp. material for additional experiments.

4.2. Evaluation Protocol

For each importance scoring functions derived above
(Sec 3.2) we ranked all labels predicted to each image.
Given this label ranking we compared top labels with the
ground-truth labels collected from raters, and computed the
precision and recall for the top-k ranked labels. Precision

and recall are usually used with more than one ground-truth
item. In our case however, for each image, there was only
one ground-truth label: the majority vote across the three
raters. As a result, the precision@1 is identical to recall@1.
We excluded images that had no majority vote (3 unique rat-
ings, 27.6% of images). OID provides conﬁdence values in
coarse resolution (1 signiﬁcant digit), hence multiple labels
in an image often share the same conﬁdence values. When
ranking by conﬁdence only, we broke ties at random.

We also tested a evaluation setup where instead of a ma-
jority label, every label provided by the three raters was con-
sidered as ground truth. Precision and recall was computed
in the same way.

4.2.1 Clean and noisy evaluation

We evaluated our approach in two setups. In the ﬁrst, clean
evaluation, we only considered image labels that were ver-
iﬁed to be correct by OID raters. Incorrect labels were ex-
cluded from the analysis and not ranked by the scoring func-
tions. We also excluded images whose ground truth label
was not in the model’s vocabulary.

In the second setup, noisy evaluation we did not force
any of these requirements. The analysis included incorrect
labels as well as images whose ground truth labels were not
in the vocabulary; and thus could not be predicted by our
model. As expected, the precision and recall in this setting
were signiﬁcantly lower.

4.3. Compared scoring functions and baselines

We compared the following information-theoretic scor-
ing functions, all weighted by classiﬁer conﬁdence. All

Table 2. Precision and recall of compared approaches. Scores
are averaged over 10 trees. cw-∆H reach an accuracy of 64% for
predicting a single label and 63% in a multi-label setup.

(Sec. 4.2.1). Figure 3.a. reveals that IOTA achieves high
precision,
including a p@1 of 64%. This precision is
only slightly lower than the agreement rate of human raters
(66%). See details in Table 2 for comparison.

Next, we show similar curves for the noisy setup. Here
we also considered images where the ground-truth label is
not included in the vocabulary, treating model predictions
for these images as false. Figure 3.b. shows that in this case
too, cw-∆H achieves the highest precision and recall com-
pare with the other approaches. As expected, the precision
and recall in this setting are lower, reaching p@1=45%.

We further tested all scoring functions using a multil-
abel evaluation protocol. Here, instead of taking the major-
ity label over three rater annotations, we used all three la-
bels (non-weighted) and computed the precision and recall
of the scoring functions against that ground truth set. Re-
sults are given in Table 2, showing a similar behavior where
cw-∆H outperforms the other scoring functions.

Ablation and comparisons. Several comparisons are
worth mentioning. First, conﬁdence-weighted approaches
(image-dependent) are consistently superior
to non-
weighted approaches. This suggests that it is not enough
to select “interesting” labels if they are not highly conﬁdent
for the image. Second, the singleton model performs poorly
compared to the full CLT, cw-∆H. This agrees with our ob-
servation that a key factor of label importance is how much
it affects uncertainty on other labels. Finally, cw-Image-
∆H, is substantially worse, which is again consistent with
the observation that structure in label space is critical.

Figure 3. Precision and recall @k in the clean setup (top) and
the noisy setup (bottom), computed over the OID-test set.(a) In
the clean setup, results are an averaged over 2877 images. cw-∆H
(blue curve) achieves p@1 of 64% and largely outperforms other
scoring functions. Rater agreement (dashed line) is at 66%, only
slightly higher than cw-∆H. (b) In the noisy setup, results are an
average over 3942 images. As with the clean set, cw-∆H out-
performs other scoring functions, but only achieves p@1 of 45%

correct for an image and is provided by the classiﬁer. La-
bels with highest conﬁdence were ranked ﬁrst; ties broken
randomly. (7) Term frequency, The empirical p(li) cap-
tures how often a label is observed in corpus, ranked in a
descending order. Note that in our data, the term frequency
produces the same ranking as singletons, because all labels
have a marginal frequency below 0.5, hence their entropy
monotonically increases with p(li).

5. Results

We ﬁrst illustrate label ranking by showing the scores
for one image. Table 1 the annotations are ordered by
cw-∆H , and the best label per column (scoring function)
is highlighted. Singleton and term frequency, p(l), yield the
same ranking (but with different values) because the entropy
grows monotonically with p. cw-DKL prefers ﬁne-grained
classes.

We next present the precision and recall of IOTA and
compared methods over the full OID-test in the clean setup

We also repeated the analysis while limiting the CL tree
to the labels present in each image. This signiﬁcantly hurt

the precision (p@1 = 0.48), suggesting that information
about out-of-image labels is important. More broadly, this
work takes a view that separates the prediction problem into
two factors: One that models the listener prior knowledge,
hence is image independent, and a second that is image de-
pendent. In the OID dataset, the blind-listener approxima-
tion proves very effective.

Originally, we expected that labels relations can be mod-
elled well using a known semantic hierarchy We tested a
hierarchy provided with OID (600 labels), but we found it
far less effective then CLT (p@1=0.34 for cw-∆H), pre-
sumably because semantic relatedness differs substantially
from visual co-occurrence. E.g., “dog” and “park” are re-
mote in a semantic hierarchy, but interdependent and hence
closer in a co-occurrence-based tree. Thus, using an exist-
ing ontology of the labels does not necessarily model the
visual co-occurrences that can be learned from data.

Qualitative results. Table 3 lists top-ranked labels by var-
ious scoring functions for three images. cw-∆H consis-
tently agrees with human annotations (in bold), capturing
an intermediate, more informative category compared with
other scoring functions. Ranking based on conﬁdence only
for the left column described the image as either shoe,
footwear or purple. While all three are technically correct,
shoe is the most natural, informative title for that image.
For the middle column (leaf) there were 20 highly-conﬁdent
predicted annotations (only 6 shown); all approaches other
than cw-∆H failed to return ”leaf”. Finally, the car ex-
ample (bottom) demonstrates a common phenomena where
cw-p(l) and cw-Singleton prefer to more abstract cate-
gories whereas cw-DKL and cw-Image∆H prefer ﬁne-
grained labels.

Figure 4. Part of Chow-Liu tree around the label “dog” learned
from the OID validation set with 765 labels. The model clearly
captures semantic relations, even-though they are not explicitly en-
forced. For instance the label “pet” is connected directly to “dog”,
and “truck” and “bike” connected to “vehicle”.

These results are all built on a Chow-Liu graphical
model. To test if its label-dependency structure reﬂects sen-
sible label semantics, Figure 4 illustrates parts of the tree
that was formed around the label dog (38 of 765 labels). Se-
mantic concepts are grouped in a way that agrees with their
meaning (mostly). Note that this tree structure, not a hierar-
chical model, but only captures the pairwise dependencies
among label co-occurrence in the open-images dataset.

Robustness to hyper parameters. We tested the robust-
ness of IOTA to the two hyper parameters of the model. (1)
The number of trees in the mixture model; and (2) The size
of the vocabulary analyzed. The model was largely robust
to these parameters. Detailed results are given in the suppl.

6. Conclusion

We present an unsupervised approach to select infor-
mative annotation for a visual scene. We model the prior
knowledge about visual experience using the joint distribu-
tion of labels, and use it to rank labels per-image by how
much entropy they can remove over the label distribution.
The top ranked labels capture labels that are “intuitive”,
showing high agreement with human raters. This is sur-
prising, since the model does not use any external source of
semantic information besides label concurrence.

Several questions remain open. First, while our current
experiments captures common context, the approach can be
extended to any context. It would be interesting to apply
this method to expert annotators with the aim of retrieving
listener-speciﬁc context. Second, easy-to-learn quantiﬁers
of label importance can be used to improve loss functions
in multi-class training, assigning more weight to more im-
portant labels.
