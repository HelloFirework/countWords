Abstract

Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution devices can as-
sist the blind in sensing the visual environment by trans-
lating the visual information into a sound pattern. To im-
prove the translation quality, the task performances of the
blind are usually employed to evaluate different encoding
schemes. In contrast to the toilsome human-based assess-
ment, we argue that machine model can be also develope-
d for evaluation, and more efﬁcient. To this end, we ﬁrst-
ly propose two distinct cross-modal perception model w.r.t.
the late-blind and congenitally-blind cases, which aim to
generate concrete visual contents based on the translated
sound. To validate the functionality of proposed models, t-
wo novel optimization strategies w.r.t. the primary encoding
scheme are presented. Further, we conduct sets of human-
based experiments to evaluate and compare them with the
conducted machine-based assessments in the cross-modal
generation task. Their highly consistent results w.r.t. differ-
ent encoding schemes indicate that using machine model to
accelerate optimization evaluation and reduce experimen-
tal cost is feasible to some extent, which could dramatically
promote the upgrading of encoding scheme then help the
blind to improve their visual perception ability.

1. Introduction

There are millions of blind people all over the world,
how to help them to “re-see” the outside world is a signif-
icant but challenging task. In general, the main causes of
blindness come from various eye diseases [35]. That is to
say, the visual cortex should be largely unwounded. Hence,
it becomes possible to use other organs (e.g., ears) as the
sensor to “visually” perceive the environment according to
the theory of cross-modal plasticity [4]. In the past decades,
there have been several projects attempting to help the dis-
abled to recover their lost senses via other sensory channels,

and the relevant equipments are usually named as Sensory
Substitution (SS) devices. In this paper, we mainly focus on
the visual-to-auditory SS device of vOICe1 (The upper case
of OIC means “Oh! I See!”).

The vOICe is an auditory sensory substitution device that
encodes 2D gray image into 1D audio signal. Concretely, it
translates vertical position to frequency, left-right position
to scan time, and brightness to sound loudness, as shown
in Fig. 1. After training with the device, both blindfolded
sighted and blind participants can identify different objects
just via the encoded audio signal [33]. More surprisingly,
neural imaging studies (e.g., fMRI and PET) show that the
visual cortex of trained participants are activated when lis-
tening to the vOICe audio [1, 28]. Some participants, espe-
cially the late-bind, report that they can “see” the shown ob-
jects, even the colorful appearance [18]. As a consequence,
the vOICe device is considered to provide a novel and effec-
tive way to assist the blind in “visually” sensing the world
via hearing [36].

However, the current vOICe encoding scheme is identi-

ﬁed as a primary solution [33]. More optimization efforts
should be considered and evaluated to improve the transla-
tion quality. Currently, we have to resort to the cognitive
assessment of participants. However, two characteristics
make it difﬁcult to be adopted in practice. First, the human-
based assessment consists of complicated training and test-
ing procedures, during which the participants have to keep
high-concentration and -pressure for a long period of time.
Such toilsome evaluation is unfriendly to the participants,
and it is also inefﬁcient. Second, amounts of control ex-
periments are required to provide convincing assessments,
which therefore need much efforts as well as huge employ-
ment cost. As a result, there is few works focusing on the
optimization of current encoding scheme, while it indeed
plays a crucial role in improving the visual perception abil-
ity of the blinds [33, 18].

By contrast, with the rapid development of machine
learning techniques, the artiﬁcial perception models have
taken the advantages of efﬁciency, economical, and conve-
nience, which exactly settle the above problems of human-
based evaluation. Hence, can we design proper machine
model for cross-modal perception like human, and view
it as an assessment reference for different audio encod-

the
distinct late- and congenitally-blind case, respectively. In
the late-blind case, as they have seen the environments be-
fore they were blind. The learned visual experiences could
help them imagine the corresponding objects when listen-
ing to the translated sound via the vOICe [1, 18]. Based
on this, we propose one Late-Blind Model (LBM), where
the visual generative model is initialized from abundan-
t visual scene for imitating the conditions before blind-
ness, then employed for visual generation based on the au-
dio embeddings of separated visual perception. While the
congenitally-blind have never seen the world before, there-
fore the absence of visual knowledge makes them difﬁcult
to imagine the shown objects. In this case, we propose a
novel Congenitally-Blind Model (CBM), where the visu-
al generation depends on the feedback of audio discrim-
inator via a derivable sound translator. Without any pri-
or knowledge in the visual domain, the CBM can generate
concrete visual contents related to the audio signal. Finally,
we employ the proposed model to evaluate different encod-
ing schemes presented by us and compare the assessments
with sets of conducted human-based evaluations. Brieﬂy,
our contributions are summarized as follows,

• We propose a novel computer-assisted evaluation task
about the encoding schemes of visual-to-auditory SS
devices for the blind community, which aims to vastly
improve the efﬁciency of evaluation.

• Two novel cross-modal perception models are devel-
oped for the late-blind and congenitally-blind condi-

tions, respectively. The generated proper visual con-
tent w.r.t. the audio signal conﬁrm their effectiveness.
• We present two novel optimization strategies w.r.t. the
current encoding schemes, and validate them on the
proposed model.

• We conduct amounts of human-based evaluation ex-
periments for the presented encoding schemes. The
highly consistent results with the machine-model veri-
fy the feasibility of machine-based assessments.

2.1. Sensory Substitution

To remedy the disabled visual perception ability of the
blind, many attempts have been made to covert the visual
information into other sensory perception, where the visual-
to-auditory sensory substitution is the most attractive and
promising fashion. The early echolocation approaches pro-
vide a considerable conversion manner [16, 17], but the re-
quired sound emission makes it impractical in many scenar-
ios, such as the noisy environment. Another important at-
tempt is to convert the visual information into speech, e.g.,
the Seeing-AI project2. However, such direct semantic de-
scription is just developed for the low vision community, as
it is hard to imagine the concrete visual shape for the blind
people, especially the congenitally blind ones. And it al-
so suffers from limited object and scene categories of the
training set. Hence, more researchers suggest to encode the
visual appearance into sequential audio signal according to
speciﬁc rules, such as the vOICe.

Most researchers consider that cross-modal plasticity is
the essential reason to the success of the SS devices [1, 21,
5, 34, 29], which is also the neurophysiological criterion
for judging the effectiveness of these devices [28]. Cross-
modal plasticity refers that the sensory deprivation of one
modality can have an impact on the cortex development of
remaining modalities [4]. For example, the auditory cortex
of deaf subjects is activated by visual stimulate [9], while
the visual cortex is activated by auditory messages for the
blind people [34]. To explore the practical effects, Arno et
al. [2] proposed to detect the neural activations via Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) when the participants are re-
quired to recognize patterns and shapes with the visual-to-
auditory SS devices. For both blindfolded sighted and con-
genitally blind participants, they found a variety of cortex
regions related to visual and spatial imagery were activat-
ed relative to the baselines of audition. More related works
can be found in [1, 21]. These evidences show that region-
s of the brain normally dedicated to vision can be used to
process visual information passed by sound [36, 25]. In ad-
dition, the above studies also show that there exit effective
interactions among modalities in the brain [4, 14].

In view that cross-modal plasticity provides a convincing
explanation for sensory substitution, how to effectively uti-
lize it for the disabled people in practice becomes the key
problem. The visual-to-auditory SS device of vOICe has
provided one feasible encoding scheme that has been ver-
iﬁed in the practical usage. But it is difﬁcult to guarantee
that whether the current scheme is the most effective one.
By conducting sets of control experiments to the curren-
t scheme, such as reversing the encoding direction (e.g., the
highest pitch is set to the bottom instead of the top of im-
age), Stiles et al. [33] found that the primary scheme did not
hold the best performance in the task of matching images
and sounds, which indicates that better encoding scheme is
expected to improve the cross-modal perception ability of
the blind people further. However, the evaluation of encod-
ing schemes based on human feedback is relatively compli-
cated and inefﬁcient. In this paper, a kind of machine model
is proposed to accelerate the assessment progress, which is
also convenient and economical.

2.2. Cross modal Machine Learning

In the machine learning community, it is also expect-
ed to build effective cross-modal learning model similar to
the brain. And many attempts have been made in differen-
t cross-modal tasks. Ngiam et al. [24] introduced a novel
learning setting to effectively evaluate the shared represen-
tation across modalities, named as “hearing to see”. There-
into, the model was trained with one provided modality but
tested on the other modality, which later conﬁrmed the ex-
isting semantic correlation across modalities. Inspired by
this, Srivastava et al. [32] proposed to generate the miss-
ing text for a given image, where the shared semantic pro-
vided the probability to predict corresponding description-
s. Further, Owens et al. [27] focused on the more compli-
cated sound generation task. They presented an algorith-
m to synthesize sound for silent videos about hitting ob-
jects. To make the generated sound realistic enough, they
resorted to a feature-based exemplar retrieval strategy in-
stead of direct generation [27]. While more recent work
proposed an immediate way in generating natural sound for
wild videos [38]. On the contrary, Chung et al. [7] pro-
posed to generate visually talking face based on an initial
frame and speech signal. For a given audio sequence, the
proposed model could generate a determined image frame
that best represents the speech sample at each time step [7].
Recently, the impressive Generation Adversarial Networks
(GANs) [12] provide more possibilities in the cross-modal
generation. The early works focused on the text-based im-
age generation [30, 37], which were all developed based on
the conditional GAN [22]. Moreover, it becomes possible
to generate images that did not exist before. Chen et al. [6]
extended above model into more complicated audiovisual
perception task. The proposed model [6] showed noticeable

performance in generating musical sounds based on the in-
put image and vice versa.

Although the cross-modal machine learning models
above have shown impressive generation ability for the
missing modality, they do not satisfy the blind condition.
This is because the blind people cannot receive the visual
information, while the above models have to utilize these in-
formation during training. By contrast, we focus on this in-
tractable cross-modal generation problem, where the miss-
ing modalities are unavailable in the whole lifecycle.

3. Cross-modal Machine Perception

3.1. Late blind Model

People who had visual experience of outside world but
go blind because of diseases or physical injury are called
late-blind people. Hence, when wearing the SS device of
the vOICe to perceive objects, the pre-existing visual ex-
perience in their brain can provide effective reference for
cross-modal perception. The relevant cognitive experiments
also conﬁrm this, especially some blind participants could
unconsciously color the objects while the color information
was not encoded into sound [18]. This probably comes
from the participants’ memory of object color [18]. Such
signiﬁcant character inspires us to build one three-stage
Late-Blind Model (LBM), as shown in Fig. 2. Concrete-
ly, we propose to model the late-blind case by decoupling
the cross-modal perception into separated sound perception
and out-of-sample visual perception, then coupling them for
visual generation. In the ﬁrst stage, as the category labels of
translated sound are available, the audio convolutional net-
work of VGGish [13] is employed as the perception model
to learn effective audio embeddings via a typical sound clas-
siﬁcation task, where the input sound are represented in log-
mel spectrogram3. For the visual modality, to achieve diver-
siform visual experience, the perception model is trained to
model abundant visual imageries via adversarial mechanis-
m in the second stage, which aims to imitate the circum-
stances of before going blind. Further, the learned audio
embeddings are viewed as the input to visual generation,
and the whole cross-modal perception model is ﬁne-tuned
by identifying the generated images with an off-the-shelf vi-
sual classiﬁer4. Obviously, the generated images w.r.t. the
translated sound should be much similar to the ones used to
train the visual generator, which accordingly provides the
possibilities to automatically color the shown objects.
Results. To evaluate the proposed LBM, we start with the
simple handwritten digits generation task. Concretely, the
MNIST images [20] are ﬁrstly translated into sounds via
the vOICe for training the audio subnet and the cross-modal

s that the visual experience learned from EMNIST indeed
helps to build visual content with audio embeddings. Fur-
ther, we attempt to generate realistic objects by training LB-
M with more difﬁcult datasets, i.e., using CIFAR-10 [19]
for cross-modal generation and ImageNet [10] for visual
knowledge learning. To improve the complexity of visu-
al experiences, apart from the nine categories of CIFAR-
106, we randomly select another ten classes from ImageNet
for training the visual networks. As expected, although
the translated sounds do not encode the color information
of original object, the generated objects are automatical-
ly colored due to the priori visual knowledge from Ima-
geNet, which provides a kind of conﬁrmation to the theory
of experience-driven multi-sensory associations [18]. But
on the other hand, due to the absence of real images, our
generated images are not as good as the ones generated by
directly discriminating images. It exactly conﬁrms the dif-
ﬁculty of cross-modal generation in the blind case.

3.2. Congenitally blind Model

Different from late-blind people, congenitally-blind peo-
ple were born blind. Their absent visual experience makes
them extremely difﬁcult to imagine the visual appearance
of shown objects. However, cross-modal plasticity provides
the possibility to effectively sense concrete visual content
via the audio channel [18, 36], which depends on speciﬁc
image-to-sound translation rules. In practice, before train-
ing the blinds to “see” objects with the vOICe device, they
should learn the translation rules ﬁrstly by identifying sim-
ple shapes, which could make them sense the objects more
precisely [33]. In other words, the cross-modal translation

helps to bridge the visual and audio perception in the brain.
Based on this, we propose a two-stage Congenitally-Blind
Model (CBM), as shown in Fig. 4. Similarly with LBM,
the VGGish network is ﬁrstly utilized to model the trans-
lated sound via a classiﬁcation task, and the extracted em-
beddings are then used as the conditional input to cross-
modal generation. In the second stage, without resorting to
the prior visual knowledge, we propose to directly gener-
ate concrete visual contents by a novel cross-modal GAN,
where the generator and discriminator deal with differen-
t modalities. By encoding the generated images into the
sound modality with derivable cross-modal translation, it
becomes feasible to directly compare the generated visu-
al image and the original translated sound. Meanwhile, to
generate correct visual content to the translated sound, the
visual generator takes the audio embeddings as the condi-
tional input and the audio discriminator takes the softmax
regression as an auxiliary classiﬁer, which accordingly con-
stitute a variant auxiliary classiﬁer GAN [26].

Results. As the visual experience is not required in the
congenitally-blind case,
the datasets employed for pre-
training the visual generator are not needed any more.
Hence, our proposed CBM is directly evaluated on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 by following the traditional training/testing
splits in [20, 19]. As the vOICe translation just deals with
gray images, the images discriminated by sound do not con-
tain RGB information, as shown in Fig. 5. Obviously, these
image samples on both datasets are not as good as the ones
of LBM, due to the compressed visual content by the sound
translator and the absent visual experience. Even so, our
CBM can still generate concrete visual content according to
the input sound, e.g, the distinct digit forms. As the objects
in CIFAR-10 suffer from complex background that distracts
the sound translation for objects, the generated appearances

become low-quality while the outlines can be still captured,
such as horse, airplane, etc. On the contrary, clean back-
ground can dramatically help to generate high-quality ob-
ject images, and more examples can be found in the follow-
ing sections.

4. Evaluation of Encoding Schemes

In view that Stiles et al. has shown the current encoding
scheme can be further optimized to improve its applicability
for the blind community [33], it becomes indispensable to
efﬁciently evaluate different schemes according to the task

performance of cross-modal perception. Traditionally, the
evaluation has to be based on the inefﬁcient participants’
feedback. In contrast, as the proposed cross-modal percep-
tion model has shown impressive visual generation ability,
especially the congenitally-blind one, it is worth consider-
ing whether the machine model can be used to evaluate the
encoding scheme. More importantly, such machine-based
assessment is more convenient and efﬁcient compared with
the manual fashion. Hence, in this section, we make a com-
parison between machine- and human-based assessment,
which is performed with modiﬁed encoding schemes.

Different from the simple reversal of the encoding direc-
tion [33], we aim to explore more possibilities in optimiz-
ing the primary scheme. First of all, a well-known fact is
that there exist large differences in bandwidth between vi-
sion and audition [18]. When 2D images are projected into
1D audio sequence with limited length, amounts of image
content and details are compressed or declined. One direct
approach is to increase the audio length, which accordingly
makes the vOICe encode more detailed visual contents with
more audio frames. Meanwhile, the blind people can also
have more time to imagine the corresponding image con-
tent. But on the other hand, such augmentation cannot be
unlimited for efﬁciency. Hence, the time length is doubled
from the primary setting of 1.05s to 2s in the ﬁrst modiﬁed
encoding scheme.

Apart from the bandwidth discrepancy, another crucial
but previously neglected fact should be also paid attention
to. Generally, humans are most sensitive (i.e. able to dis-
cern at the lowest intensity) to the sound frequencies be-
tween 2K and 5K Hz [11]. As the blind participants per-

ceive the image content via their ears, it is necessary to
provide high-quality audio signal that should exist in the
sensitive frequency area. However, due to the bandwidth
discrepancy between modalities, it is difﬁcult to precisely
perceive and imagine all the visual contents in front of the
blind via the translated sound. To address this issue, we
argue that the center of the visual ﬁeld should be more im-
portant than other visual areas for the convenience of prac-
tical use. Hence, we aim to effectively project the central
areas to the sensitive frequencies of human ears. Inspired
by [15], a novel rectiﬁed tanh distribution is proposed for
Position-Frequency (PF) projection, i.e.,

f requency = s/2 · tanh (α · (i − rows/2)) +s/2,

(1)

where s is the frequency range of the encoded sound, α is
the scaling parameter, i is the position of translated pix-
el, and rows is the image height. As shown in Fig. 6,
it is obvious that the image centers (row 20-40) fall into
the most sensitive frequencies area, where the highest pitch
corresponds to the top position of image. More important-
ly, compared with the suppressed frequency response of the
peripheral regions of images, the central regions enjoy larg-
er frequency range and are accordingly given more atten-
tion.
In contrast, the exponential function adopted in the
primary setting takes no consideration of the auditory per-
ception characteristics of humans. The translated sound of
most image areas are suppressed in the low-frequency area
of below 2K Hz, which neither focus on the sensitive fre-
quencies area nor highlight the central regions of images.
Hence, such function could be not an appropriate choice.

To effectively evaluate the proposed encoding schemes,
amounts of evaluation tests should be conducted with par-
ticipants. Accordingly,
if more modiﬁed schemes are
provided, much more training and testing efforts will be
required, which could go beyond what we can support.
Hence, we choose to focus on these two modiﬁcations w.r.t.
audio length and position-frequency function, as well as the
primary one.

4.1. Machine Assessment

The quality of generated modality depends on the quality
of the other encoded modality in the cross-modal generative
model [38, 30, 6]. Hence, it can be expected to evaluate d-
ifferent encoding schemes by comparing the generated im-
ages. In this section, the proposed CBM is chosen as the
evaluation reference, as the encoding scheme directly im-
pacts the quality of translated sound for the audio discrimi-
nator, then further affects the performance of visual gener-
ator, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the adopted MNIST and
CIFAR-10 dataset suffer from absent real object or quite
complex background. These weaknesses make it quite hard
to effectively evaluate the practical effects of different en-
coding schemes. Therefore, we choose the Columbia Ob-

which consists of 1,440 gray-scale images that belong to 20
objects. These images are taken by placing the objects in
the frame center in front of a clean black background, mean-
while a ﬁxed rotation of 5 degree around the objects is also
performed, which leads to 72 images per object. Consider-
ing that this dataset will be also adopted by human-based
assessment, we select 10 object categories from COIL-20
for efﬁciency (i.e., COIL-10), where the testing set consist-
s of 10 selected images of each object, and the remaining
ones constitute the training set.

Results. To comprehensively evaluate the generated im-
ages, qualitative and quantitative evaluation are both con-
sidered. As shown in Fig. 7, in general outlook, as well as
in matters of detail, the images of the modiﬁed schemes are
superior to the primary ones. Obviously, the images gener-

ated by the primary scheme suffer from horizontal texture
noise. This is because most image area are suppressed in the
low-frequency domain, which makes the audio network dif-
ﬁcult to achieve effective embeddings for visual generation.
By contrast, longer audio track or more effective PF func-
tion can contribute to settle such issue. In addition, com-
pared with longer audio signal, the improvement attainable
with the proposed PF function of tanh is more signiﬁcant,
such as the details of toy car and fortune cat. And such su-
periority comes from the effective frequency representation
of pixel positions.

For the quantitative evaluation, we choose to compute
inception score [31] and human-based evaluation, as shown
in Fig. 8. Concretely, we ask 18 participants to grade the
quality of generated images from 1 to 5 for each scheme,
which correspond to {beyond recognition, rough outline,
clear outline, certain detail, legible detail}. Then, mean
value and standard deviation are computed for comparison.
In Fig. 8, it is clear that the qualitative and quantitative e-
valuation show consistent results. In particular, both of the
inception score and human evaluation show that the modi-
ﬁed encoding scheme of PF function enjoys the largest im-
provements, which further conﬁrms the signiﬁcance of the
projection function. And the enlarged audio length indeed
helps to reﬁne the primary scheme.

4.2. Cognitive Assessment

The blind participants’ feedback or task performance is
usually served as the indicator to the quality of encoding
schemes in the conventional assessment [3, 33]. Follow-
ing the conventional evaluation strategy [33], 9 participants
are randomly divided into three groups (3 participants per
group). Each group corresponds to one of the three encod-

ing schemes. The entire evaluation process takes about 11
hours. Before the formal evaluation, the participants are
ﬁrstly asked to complete the preliminary training lessons
to be familiar with the translation rules and simple visual
concepts. The preliminary lessons include: identiﬁcation
of simple shape, i.e., triangle, square, and circle; recogni-
tion of complex shape, e.g., a normal “L”, an upside-down
“L”, a backward “L”, and a backward and upside-down “L”;
perception of orientation, e.g., straight white line of ﬁxed-
length in different rotation angles; estimation of lengths,
e.g., horizonal white line with different lengths; localiza-
tion of objects, i.e., circles in different places of images.
During training, the assistant of each participant plays the
pre-translated sound for them, then tell them the concrete
visual content within the corresponding image7. After ﬁn-
ishing amounts of repetitive preliminary lessons, the par-
ticipants are scheduled to achieve advanced training of rec-
ognizing real objects. Concretely, the COIL-10 dataset is
adopted for training and testing the participants, where the
training procedure is the same as the preliminary lessons.
Note that the evaluation test is conducted after ﬁnishing the
training of each object category instead of all the categories.
Finally, the evaluation results are viewed as the quality es-
timation of the encoded sound and used as the reference for
machine-based assessment.
Results. Fig. 9 shows the evaluation results in precision, re-
call and F1-score w.r.t. different encoding schemes. Specif-
ically, the scheme with modiﬁed PF function performed sig-
niﬁcantly better than the primary scheme (p < 0.005, with
Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction) in precision,
and the recall bars indicate that the scheme with modiﬁed
PF function performed signiﬁcantly better than the primary
scheme (p < 0.01, with Bonferroni multiple comparisons
correction). Similar results are observed on F1-score. Ac-
cording to the conventional criterion [33], it can be conclud-
ed that the introduced modiﬁcations indeed help to improve

the quality of cross-modal translation. And it further con-
ﬁrms the assumptions about audio length and the character-
istics of human hearing. Nevertheless, there still remains
a large disparity of classiﬁcation performance between nor-
mal visual and indirect auditory perception. Hence, more
effective encoding schemes are expected for the blind com-
munity.

4.3. Assessment Analysis

The main motivation of designing the cross-modal per-
ception model is to liberate the participants from the bor-
ing and inefﬁcient human assessments. According to the
shown results above, we can ﬁnd that the modiﬁed scheme
of PF function gets the best performance while the primary
scheme is the worst one on both assessments. Further, quan-
titative comparison is also provided in Table 1. Obvious-
ly, both assessments have reached a consensus in terms of
correlation coefﬁcient, especially the column of Inception
Score (IS), which conﬁrms the validity of machine-based
assessments to some extent.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective machine-
assisted evaluation approach to the visual-to-auditory SS
scheme. Compared with the conventional human-based as-
sessments, the machine fashion performs more efﬁciently
and conveniently. On the other hand, this paper gives a new
direction for the auto-evaluation of SS devices through lim-
ited comparisons, more possibilities should be explored in
the future, including more optimization schemes and more
effective machine evaluation model. Further, the evalua-
tion should be combined with derivable encoding module
to constitute a completely automated solver of the encoding
scheme without any human intervention, just like seeking
high-quality models via AutoML.
