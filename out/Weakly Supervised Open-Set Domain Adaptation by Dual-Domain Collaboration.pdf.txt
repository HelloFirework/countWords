In conventional domain adaptation, a critical assump-
tion is that there exists a fully labeled domain (source)
that contains the same label space as another unlabeled
or scarcely labeled domain (target). However, in the real
world, there often exist application scenarios in which both
domains are partially labeled and not all classes are shared
between these two domains. Thus, it is meaningful to let
partially labeled domains learn from each other to clas-
sify all the unlabeled samples in each domain under an
open-set setting. We consider this problem as weakly super-
vised open-set domain adaptation. To address this practical
setting, we propose the Collaborative Distribution Align-
ment (CDA) method, which performs knowledge transfer
bilaterally and works collaboratively to classify unlabeled
data and identify outlier samples. Extensive experiments
on the Ofﬁce benchmark and an application on person re-
identiﬁcation show that our method achieves state-of-the-
art performance.

1. Introduction

We have recently seen state-of-the-art performances in
many computer vision applications, mostly with deep learn-
ing. Nevertheless, most of that impressive progress strongly
depends on a large collection of labeled data. However,
in real-world applications, labeled data are often scarce or
sometimes even unobtainable. A straightforward solution is
to utilize off-the-shelf labeled datasets (e.g., ImageNet [6]).
However, datasets collected in different scenarios could be
in different data domains due to differences in many aspects
(e.g., background, light and sensor resolution). Therefore,
there is a strong demand to align the two domains and lever-

In each domain, there are
some labeled and unlabeled samples. The frame colors represent
the class of each item, while the unknown-class items have black
frames. Without domain collaboration, the blue-framed item in
Domain B cannot be classiﬁed properly because there are no la-
beled blue-framed data in its own domain. This is the same for the

age labeled data from the source domain to train a classiﬁer
that is applicable in the target domain. This approach is
termed domain adaptation [33].

In conventional domain adaptation, the label spaces of
the source and target domains are identical. However, such
a setting may be restricted in applications. Recently in [2],
open-set domain adaptation was proposed, where there ex-
ist samples in the target domain that do not belong to any
class in the source domain, and vice versa. These samples
cannot be represented by any class in the known label space,
and they are therefore aggregated to an additional unknown
class. One of our main goals is to detect these unknown-
class samples in the target domain and in the meantime still
classify the remaining known-class samples.

Moreover, in real applications, there often exists a large
number of partially labeled datasets, where we cannot al-
ways ﬁnd an off-the-shelf source dataset. Therefore, in the
absence of an ideally large source domain, it is meaning-

ful to perform domain adaptation collaboratively between
these partially labeled domains. Hence, we consider the
open-set domain adaptation together with the partially la-
beled datasets, which we call weakly supervised open-set
domain adaptation. The differences between our setting
and the existing ones are illustrated in Figure 2.

The weakly supervised open-set domain adaptation is
practical whenever research or commercial groups need to
collaborate by sharing datasets. This situation often hap-
pens when two groups each collected a large dataset in re-
lated areas, but each of them has only annotated a subset
of all the item classes of interest (see Figure 1). To fully
label the collected datasets, the groups need to share their
datasets and let them learn from each other, which exactly
ﬁts our proposed setting, while traditional domain adapta-
tion settings are not applicable.

Moreover, the proposed setting is practical when collect-
ing a large source domain is unrealistic. This is often the
case in real applications, as it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd large la-
beled data for items that only appear in speciﬁc tasks, which
makes existing domain adaptation methods not applicable.
For example, in person re-identiﬁcation (see Section 4.2), it
is impossible to ﬁnd off-the-shelf labeled datasets for per-
son identities captured by a certain camera view. Under
this situation, one can let partially labeled datasets collected
in different circumstances (e.g., data collected by different
camera views) help label each other, for which our proposed
setting is very suitable.

A key challenge of solving the weakly supervised open-
set domain adaptation problem is how to perform domain
adaptation when there only exists a small quantity of la-
beled data in both domains. To address this challenge, we
propose to align two domains in a collaborative fashion. By
implementing a novel dual mapping method, i.e., learning
domain-speciﬁc feature transformations for each domain,
we iteratively map the feature spaces of two domains DA
and DB onto a shared latent space. To alleviate the ef-
fect of the unknown class, during the dual mapping opti-
mization, we simultaneously maximize the margin between
known-class and unknown-class samples, along with mini-
mizing feature distribution discrepancy and intraclass varia-

tion. Therefore, we are able to obtain more robust unknown
detection under the open-set setting. In addition, to enrich
the discriminant ability, we propose to enlarge the label set
by making pseudo-label predictions for the unlabeled sam-
ples, which are further selected by information entropy and
used in dual-mapping optimization. After the domains are
aligned in the shared latent space, we ﬁnally learn a classi-
ﬁer with labeled data from both domains. We call the above
process that covers all the main challenges the Collabora-
tive Distribution Alignment (CDA) method. Figure 3 shows
an overview of our method.

The contributions of our paper are as follows:
1. We proposed the weakly supervised open-set domain
adaptation, which allows partially labeled domains to
be fully annotated by learning from each other. This
setting extends domain adaptation to the scenarios
where an ideal source domain is absent.

2. We proposed a collaborative learning method to ad-
dress the proposed problem, which is well designed to
handle the challenges introduced by both weakly su-
pervised and open-set settings.

3. We evaluated our method on the standard domain
adaptation benchmark Ofﬁce and a real-world person
re-identiﬁcation application and showed its effective-
ness.

Conventional Domain Adaptation. Domain adaptation is
an important research area in machine learning. The core
task of standard domain adaptation is to transfer discrim-
inative knowledge from one fully labeled source domain
to a scarcely labeled or unlabeled target domain [33]. A
large number of methods have been proposed to solve this
problem. A main stream of these works is to align the fea-
ture distributions of different domains onto a latent space.
Along these lines, TCA [32] and JDA [28] were proposed
to explicitly align marginal or joint distributions, while sev-
eral models further extended the distribution alignment with
structural consistency or geometrical discrepancy [16, 47].
Several recent works also introduced dataset shift losses
to train deep networks that learn domain-invariant features

Figure 3. An overview of our approach. In (a), labeled samples from different classes are ﬁlled with corresponding colors, while the gray
samples are unlabeled. The shape of each sample indicates its ground-truth class. Speciﬁcally, the diamond-shaped samples represent the
unknown-class samples. Note that the unknown-class samples are those that cannot be represented in the known label space, while the
unlabeled samples are those without label information. Therefore, an unknown-class sample can be either labeled or unlabeled. In (b),
we assign pseudo-labels (represented by frame colors) for some unlabeled samples, while excluding the remaining uncertain samples as
outliers. In (c), we learn a set of domain-speciﬁc mappings that transform samples onto a latent domain, where domain discrepancy is
reduced, same-class samples are aggregated, and separations between unknown and known class samples are formed. We then use the
transformed features to update pseudo-labels in (b) and iterate between (b) and (c) until convergence. Finally, in the latent space shown in
(d), we use a base classiﬁer to annotate all the unlabeled samples, which we expect to be predicted as one of the known classes (red, green,
and blue), or as an unknown-class sample (yellow). (Best viewed in color)

[26, 29, 30, 42]. Another stream of work focuses on learn-
ing a subspace where both domains have a shared represen-
tation. SA [9] was proposed to align the PCA subspace,
while CORAL [39] utilizes second-order statistics to min-
imize domain shift. Manifold learning was also conducted
to ﬁnd a geodesic path from the source to target domain
[11, 13]. More recently, various generative adversarial mod-
els have been proposed [7, 17, 36, 41], in which feature ex-
tractors are trained to generate features for target samples
that are not discriminated from the source samples. Al-
though these methods are state-of-the-art for conventional
domain adaptation tasks, none of them can directly tackle
the weakly supervised open-set domain adaptation problem.
On one hand, many of these methods require a fully labeled
domain as a source, which does not exist in our setting. On
the other hand, all of them are designed for the setting where
the label spaces are identical, while in our setting, the label
spaces of the two domains are overlapping but not identi-
cal. Thus, the performances of these methods are hindered
by the unknown-class samples in each domain. In contrast,
our proposed method is well designed for scarcely labeled
domain pairs under the open-set setting.

Open-set Setting. In real-word application, the unknown
impostors, which cannot be represented by any class in the
label space of known classes, could signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the overall performance. This problem has been receiving
attention in the ﬁeld of open-set object recognition [23, 37].
A typical solution is the OSVM [18], in which impostors
are detected by estimating the inclusion probability. In the
context of person re-identiﬁcation, Zheng et al. proposed to
explicitly learn a separation between a group of nontarget
and target people [51]. Recently, Busto and Gall proposed
the open-set setting for domain adaptation [2]. Their solu-
tion is to iteratively associate target samples with potential

labels and map samples from the source domain to target
domain, in which the unknown class is regarded as a nor-
mal class. More recently, the proposed OpenBP [36] adver-
sarially learns a decision boundary for the unknown class.
In contrast to these methods, we explicitly construct large
margins between the known and unknown class samples
and in the meantime ensure that the unknown-class sam-
ples are not aligned between domains. Therefore, we can
detect unknown-class samples more robustly.
Multi-task Learning. Our collaborative distribution align-
ment is a bilateral transfer, which is related to multi-task
learning [48]. Through multi-task learning, tasks collabo-
rate by sharing parameters [21, 27, 31] or features [5, 22],
while in our method, domain collaboration is achieved by
directly sharing data. Further, one may simply tackle
the weakly supervised open-set domain adaptation problem
with two tasks, each of which aims at training an indepen-
dent classiﬁer for a single domain. However, as illustrated
in Figure 1, without the sharing of cross-domain data, many
samples cannot be properly labeled. On the other hand, if
we train a single classiﬁer with shared data, the problem
degenerates to single-task learning.

3. Collaborative Distribution Alignment

3.1. Approach Overview

To address the weakly supervised open-set domain adap-
tation problem, we aim to learn a shared latent space in
which samples from different domains are well aligned.
Suppose that we have two different domains DA and DB,
both of which have partially labeled samples. Let {Di =
Li (cid:2) Ui}i=A,B, where Li = {(xj
j=1 denotes the la-
beled set with sample xj
i , and Ui =
{(xj
j=li+1 is the unlabeled portion with unlabeled sam-

i ∈ Rd and label yj

i )}li+ui

i )}li

i , yj

ples. Here, x is the d-dimensional feature representation of
each image sample, while li and ui represent the sizes of
Li and Ui, respectively.
In practice, we have li << ui.
Given a set Ci in labeled portion Li, which includes |Ci| − 1
known classes and an additional unknown class that gathers
instances from all the classes that cannot be found in the
known label space, our goal is to label each sample in Ui
with a known class or detect it as an unknown-class sample.
From Figure 3(a), we can see that some samples in UA
do not belong to CA but to CB. For example, there are un-
labeled square samples in Domain A, but no labeled square
sample exists in this domain. Merely using LA, we cannot
properly label these samples. We then leverage the total la-
beled set L, which consists of the labeled set LA and LB
with the classes CL = CA (cid:2) CB, to label all the samples in
UA and UB as one of the classes in CL. However, due to
domain shift between DA and DB, directly using L would
cause signiﬁcant performance degeneration [33]. To solve
this problem under our proposed setting, we focused on the
following two most important features of our setting, which
have not been well studied before:

1) Under the weakly supervised setting, we need to trans-
fer knowledge bilaterally. Thus, for the ﬁrst time, we in-
troduce dual mapping (learning dual domain-speciﬁc map-
pings) into the domain adaptation area. Dual mapping can
better exploit domain-speciﬁc information and align both
domains onto the shared latent space (see Table 4).

2) Under the open-set setting, there could be a large num-
ber of unknown-class samples. To avoid confusing these
samples with known-class ones, we are the ﬁrst in domain
adaptation to explicitly form large margins between known-
class and unknown-class samples (Eq.3).

A and DBW ′

B. Next, DAW ′

In general, our method works as follows. In each iter-
ation, we ﬁrst assign pseudo-labels to a subset of samples
in UA and UB. Then, we use the estimated pseudo-labels
as well as the labeled set L to learn optimized values W ′
A
and W ′
B are1 used to update the
pseudo-labels, and a new iteration starts. This circle contin-
ues until it converges. After the termination, any base clas-
siﬁers (SVM, k-NN) can be trained on LAWA and LBWB
and predict labels for UAWA and UBWB. We expect that
the domain shift has been largely alleviated by performing
this iterative optimization. The whole process is shown in
Figure 3 and detailed in the following sections.

3.2. Pseudo-Label Assignment

Label Prediction. In the real world, there are usually much
fewer labeled samples than unlabeled ones. With the scarce
labeled samples, we are not able to robustly perform the
subsequent optimization of WA and WB. Therefore, to en-
large the label information set, we propose to ﬁrst estimate
the pseudo-labels of samples from UA and UB. This can

A.

be easily done by applying base classiﬁers trained on L to
predict labels of UA and UB. This base classiﬁer can be
either k-NN, standard or variants of SVM, or neural net-
works. In our method, we simply utilize the standard lin-
ear SVM (LSVM) with probability estimation in the libsvm
package [4] due to its wide use in domain adaptation works
[2, 24, 39, 45].
Outlier Detection. However, due to domain discrepancy,
some of the pseudo-labels are assigned uncertainly, and
therefore, false estimation would result. We need to elim-
inate those uncertain labels from the optimization step in
order to avoid iterative propagation of false estimations. As
we have gained probability distribution estimations for each
sample from LSVM, we propose to leverage information
entropy H to estimate the certainty of the prediction for
each sample. A higher H means that the probability dis-
tribution is more sparse, indicating that this prediction is
more likely to be false. Therefore, we tend to only use sam-
ples with relatively low information entropy in the mapping
step. Let xi be the ith sample and C be the total number of
classes, and Yij is the probability of xi belonging to class j,
given by LSVM. The information entropy of this prediction
is denoted as

H(xi) = −

C

(cid:3)

j=1

Yijlog(Yij).

(1)

Then, if H(xi) ≥ γ, we mark xi as an outlier that will not
be used for dual mapping; otherwise, xi will be used. Here,
γ is an auto-adaptive threshold, which is set to the mean
value of H over all the samples. In the next iteration, all the
unlabeled samples will be regarded equally again. Please
note that unknown-class samples that are not close to any of
the labeled samples would more likely be detected by this
process for their low conﬁdence.

3.3. Dual Mapping Under Open-set Condition

We intend to perform the dual mapping process by learn-
ing WA, WB ∈ Rd×d for DA and DB, respectively. It is ex-
pected that WA and WB are able to map DA and DB onto a
shared latent space. By learning these domain-speciﬁc ma-
trices, we can better exploit domain-speciﬁc information for
the two domains. This is different from most domain adap-
tation methods that only learn a single transform to transfer
samples between domains [2, 28, 32, 39]. In Section 4.3, we
have also empirically found that learning domain-speciﬁc
transformation is more ﬂexible for solving the weakly su-
pervised open-set domain adaptation, as both domains play
equal roles in this problem.

Known-Unknown Class Separation. Under the open-set
setting, a main task is to detect and separate the unknown-
class samples [2]. If there is no robust separation between
known and unknown class samples, the overlapping of the

5397

known and unknown class samples would probably cause
the problem of labelling a known-class sample as an un-
known impostor, or vice versa. This signiﬁcantly degen-
erates the overall performance. To solve this problem, we
propose to encourage each known-class sample to be closer
to its class center than to any of the unknown-class samples
by a large margin.

where PD = 1
D is the mean of known samples

in domain D, and nk
D denotes the number of those sam-
ples. Similarly, the distance between conditional distribu-
tions DistC can be measured by the sum of the distances
between the corresponding known class centers in both do-
mains. That is deﬁned as

To begin, we ﬁrst compute the distances of each known-
unknown sample pair in the transformed space. For each
known-class sample x in domain D ∈ {A, B}, we ﬁnd its
nearest unknown-class neighbor xu, which is the unknown-
class sample with the smallest distance from x. We formally
deﬁne this distance as fu(x) = (cid:4)xWD − xuWD′ (cid:4)2
F , where
D′ is the domain that xu belongs to. Similarly, we deﬁne
the distance between x and its class center xc
D as fc(x) =
(cid:4)(x − xc

F . We hope that for every x, we have

D)WD(cid:4)2

fc(x) + 1 < fu(x),

(2)

where 1 is the margin parameter that sets the scale of WA
and WB [43]. We deﬁne CK as the set of all the known
classes and Xc
D as the sample set of class c in domain D.
Then, the loss function for unknown separation in domain
D can be deﬁned as

UD = (cid:3)

(cid:4)1 + fc(xi) − fu(xi)(cid:5)+ ,

c∈CK ,xi∈Xc

D

(3)

where the term [x]+ = max{x, 0} is the standard hinge
loss, which allows us to only penalize the unknown im-
postors that are inside the safety margin of x and xc
D. For
unknown-class samples that are far enough, the hinge loss
becomes 0 and does not contribute to UD. The total un-
known separation loss of DA and DB is deﬁned as

U =

1
2

(UA + UB).

(4)

Aligning Known-class Samples between Domains. Un-
der the open-set setting, aligning all samples between two
domains is unnecessary because the purpose of dual map-
ping is to align all the known-class samples to gain a better
classiﬁcation performance while dragging all the unknown-
class samples away from the known ones to make a clear
separation.

To this end, we discard all the unknown class samples in
the distribution alignment process for domain adaptation.
To measure the domain discrepancy, we adopt the maxi-
mum mean discrepancy (MMD) [1], which is a widely used
nonparametric domain discrepancy measurement in domain
adaptation works [26, 28, 32, 42].

More speciﬁcally, the marginal distribution distance be-

tween the transformed domains can be computed by

DistC =

where P c
D is the mean of class c samples,
and xc,i
D is the ith sample of class c in domain D. The label
of each sample is either provided by the dataset or assigned
by pseudo-label prediction.

By minimizing DistM and DistC , the discrepancies
between both marginal and conditional distributions of
known-class samples in DA and DB are reduced, while the
unknown-class samples will not be improperly aligned.

Aggregating Same-class Samples. To facilitate the center-
based separation between known and unknown class sam-
ples (Eq.4) as well as the alignment between known class
samples based on MMD (Eq.6), we propose to explicitly
aggregate all the samples to their class centers.

In detail, we deﬁne xc

D as the estimated center of class
D as the sample set of class c with
D. Then, the aggregation loss function GD can be

Overall, the total loss G of DA and DB is then deﬁned as

Objective Function. With all the components discussed
above, our method can be formed now. To conﬁgure the
strength of each component, we introduce balancing param-
eters λM , λG, and λU for marginal distribution alignment,
center aggregation and known-unknown class separation,
respectively. We deﬁne the total loss function as

f = DistC + λM DistM + λGG + λU U .

Then, our objective function can be concluded as follows:

4. Experiments

4.1. Ofﬁce Dataset

The Ofﬁce dataset [35] is a standard benchmark for do-
main adaptation evaluation [2, 26, 39, 36] and consists of
three real-word object domains: Amazon (A), Webcam (W)
and DSLR (D). In total, it has 4,652 images with 31 classes.
We construct three dual collaboration tasks: A ↔ W, A ↔
D and W ↔ D, where ↔ denotes the collaboration relation
between two domains. Similar to [2], we extract the fea-
tures using ResNet-50 [14] pretrained on ImageNet [6]. For
parameters, we set λM = 10, λG = 1 and λU = 0.1.
Protocol. We randomly selected 15 classes as the known
classes, and the remaining classes are set as one unknown
class, i.e., there are 16 classes in total. Both domains con-
tain all 16 classes, while only a subset of them have labeled
samples. Speciﬁcally, we randomly selected 10 known
classes to form the labeled known-class set for each domain,
with the constraint that 5 classes are shared between them.
Similar to [2], for each domain, we randomly took 3 sam-
ples from each class in the labeled known-class set and 9
samples from the unknown class, as labeled samples, and
set all the remaining as unlabeled. We expect each unla-
beled sample to be correctly labeled either as one of the 15
known classes or the unknown class. The above is repeated
5 times, and the mean accuracy and standard deviation of
each method are reported.
Compared Methods. We ﬁrst compared the proposed CDA
with two open-set domain adaptation methods, ATI [2] and
OpenBP [36]. The conventional unsupervised domain adap-
tation methods, including TCA [32], GFK [11], CORAL
[39], JAN [30] and PADA [3], are compared as well. Since
our method learns dual projections, to undertake a fair com-
parison, for methods that require a single labeled domain
(ATI, OpenBP, JAN, and PADA), we apply them by two
steps: given LA as the source and DB as the unlabeled tar-
get, we learn to transform LA to DB, and label UB with LA
and LB. Then, we learn to label UA in a symmetrical way.
For other methods, we simply transform DA to DB.

Since there are a small number of labeled samples in
the target domain for semi-supervised domain adaptation,
we also compared two semi-supervised methods, namely
MMDT [15] and ATI-semi [2]. We test these methods in a
way similar to methods such as ATI and JAN, except the tar-
get domain in each symmetry step here is semi-supervised.
In addition, we compared multi-task learning methods
since our method beneﬁts from the collaborative transfer be-
tween two domains, which is related to multi-task learning.
For comparison, we report the results of CLMT [5], AMTL
[21], and MRN [27]. By following [5, 21], every task in
CLMT and AMTL is set as a one-vs-all binary classiﬁca-
tion problem. For MRN, we denote two tasks as learning
classiﬁers on DA and DB, separately.

The results of the above methods are obtained by linear
SVM and trained and tested on transformed features, ex-
cept for CLMT and AMTL, which directly learn classiﬁers.
As baselines, we report results of the LSVM trained with
non-adaptation data L, which we call NA. We also report
another baseline called NA-avg, which is the average accu-
racy of training and testing a LSVM for each domain inde-
pendently. Moreover, we have also undertaken a compari-
son with methods in [9, 10, 26, 28, 40, 47, 42], the results
of which are less competitive and are thus only included in
the supplementary material for sake of space.

Table 1. Comparing state-of-the-art methods on Ofﬁce. The 1st/2nd
best results are indicated in red/blue.

Comparison Results. The results are shown in Table 1. We
can observe that our proposed CDA method outperforms all
the other methods in the three tasks. For example, CDA
respectively surpasses the best alternative TCA by 3.8%,
4.6% and 4.6% in A↔W, A↔D and W↔D, respectively.
Further, CDA exceeds TCA by 4.33% (80.13%-75.80%) on
average. The reasons may be as follows. (1) Unlike closed-
set methods (such as TCA) that align distributions over all
the samples, our CDA is well designed to only align feature
distributions of the known classes. By doing so, we avoid
a negative transfer caused by aligning distributions of the
unknown class, the samples of which may actually come
from different classes with inherently different features. (2)
CDA learns more discriminative features by minimizing in-
traclass variation and explicitly separating known and un-
known class samples, while most other methods only focus
on learning domain-invariant features. (3) CDA simultane-
ously exploits unlabeled information in both domains, while
other methods that require a fully labeled source domain
(such as ATI) only use unlabeled data in a single domain in
each symmetry step.

Additionally, our method outperformed semi-supervised
domain adaptation methods. This could be because we
simultaneously utilize unlabeled data from both domains,
while these methods use them separately. Moreover, CDA
largely exceeds multi-task learning methods, which occurs
mainly because (1) CDA aligns both domains, but AMTL
and CLMT ignore the domain discrepancy in training sam-
ples and because (2) CDA merges incomplete label spaces
of LA and LB to form a complete one, while in MRN, these
label spaces are separated.

4.2. Person Re-identiﬁcation (re-id) Application

A natural practical example of our proposed setting can
be the person re-identiﬁcation (re-id) problem [12], which is
widely and deeply researched in computer vision for visual
surveillance [7, 8, 46, 51]. Re-id aims to match people’s im-
ages across nonoverlapping camera views. Currently, train-
ing state-of-the-art re-id models requires a large number of
cross-camera labeled images [20, 25, 43], but it is very ex-
pensive to manually label (pairwise) people images across
cameras views. Further, as mentioned before, we cannot
ﬁnd an off-the-shelf source domain for these people. Thus,
it is meaningful to annotate images in each camera pair
by performing domain adaptation collaboratively between
these camera views. Moreover, it is hard to guarantee that
people appearing in one camera view would also appear in
another view. This problem introduces the open-set setting.
Therefore, to show the practicality of the proposed setting
and the effectiveness of CDA, we conduct an experiment on
a real-world re-id application in this subsection.

DukeMTMC-reID [34] is a popular re-id benchmark
[7, 8, 38, 44]. It consists of person images from 8 nonover-
lapping camera views. The DukeMTMC-reID dataset is a
genuine open-set re-id dataset, since for each camera pair,
there are a number of identities that only appear in one view
and thus lack an image to match in another view. For exam-
ple, in camera pair 1 ↔ 2, there are 105 identities unique to
camera 1 and 84 identities unique to camera 2. For evalu-
ation, we conducted our experiments on the largest portion
gallery. We constructed 8 camera pairs for our experiment,
where each camera view appears twice, and extracted fea-
tures with ResNet-50 that was pretrained on Market-1501
[49] using the method in [50]. For parameters, we set
λM = 10, λG = 1, and λU = 1.
Protocol. For both camera views, we let the classes that
only appear in a single camera view belong to the unknown
class, while the shared classes are set as known classes.
To simulate the weakly supervised setting, in each camera
view, all the known classes exist, but only a subset of them
have labeled samples. We call the set of known classes that
have labeled samples the labeled known-class set. Suppose

there are N known classes. Then, for each camera view,
we randomly select 2N /3 known classes to form its labeled
known-class set, with the constraint that N /3 classes are
shared between these sets of both views. Then, for each
view, we randomly take 1 image as a labeled sample from
each class in its labeled known-class set. Additionally, N /4
samples from the unknown class are labeled as well. All the
rest are set as unlabeled. During testing, for each image in
the unlabeled set, we retrieve the matched persons from the
labeled set. Then, we use the cumulative match characteris-
tic (CMC) to measure the re-id matching performance.

Compared Methods. We ﬁrst evaluated all the meth-
ods mentioned in Section 4.1, except AMTL and CLMT,
since they merely learn a classiﬁer and are thus unsuit-
able for distance-based person re-id tasks. Moreover, we
include common re-id oriented methods (1)LMNN [43],
(2)KISSME [20], (3)XQDA [25], and (4) DLLR [19], as
well as the newly proposed SPGAN [7]. To test SPGAN,
for each pair, we use this model to transfer the image style
of each sample in the ﬁrst view to the other view and then
evaluate on these transferred images. As baselines, we re-
port results of directly computing Euclidean distances on
the original space, namely, NA and NA-avg (similar to the
baselines used in Section 4.1).

Comparison Results. The results are shown in Table 2.
Our method outperformed all the other methods in 6 of the
8 total tasks, for example, surpassing the best alternative
LMNN by 5.2%, 19.9%, 8.2%, and 33.7% at rank-1 on
1↔2, 2↔3, 5↔6 and 7↔8, respectively. The performance
margins over the other methods are larger still. On aver-
age, our method outperforms the most competitive methods
by 8.6% (68.1%-59.5%) and 10.2% (86.9%-76.7%) at rank-
1 and rank-5, respectively. It is obvious that CDA signiﬁ-
cantly outperformed NA and NA-avg, while almost all the
compared methods at least once performed worse than the
baselines due to negative transfer.

Compared to typical methods for re-id, CDA achieves
better performance mainly because (1) CDA makes use of a
large number of unlabeled samples by pseudo-label assign-
ment, while LMNN, KISS and XQDA merely rely on la-

beled samples, and (2) CDA explicitly separates known and
unknown-class samples, while the compared methods (such
as SPGAN) do not distinguish these two kinds of samples.
The superior performance of CDA in re-id further validates
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

4.3. Further Analysis of CDA

Effect of Each Component. Our loss function in Equa-
tion 9 involves four components: the marginal and condi-
tional distribution alignments (DistM , DistC ), the intra-
class aggregation (G), and the unknown-class sample sep-
aration (U ). We empirically evaluated the importance of
each component. For each component, we report the per-
formance of the CDA model when each component is elim-
inated. The results are shown in Table 3. We can observe
that the accuracy of CDA would drop once we remove any
of the components. For example, on task 5↔6, the perfor-
mance decreased by 11.7%, 4.2%, 38.4% and 1.2% when
G, U , DistC , and DistM was removed, respectively.

Parameter Sensitivity. In this section, we evaluated the pa-
rameter sensitivity of our model. We run CDA with a large
range of parameters λM , λU and λG from 0 to 50. The
results of randomly chosen tasks are shown in Figure 4 on
the two datasets used in our experiments. As shown, there
should be a proper range for each parameter. Taking λU for
example, when λU is too large, we mainly learn to separate
known/unknown-class samples, making feature alignment
weaker; when it is too small, we are not able to adequately
separate known/unknown-class samples. Nevertheless, it
can be observed that the performance of CDA is robust for
λM ∈ [0.001, 10], λU ∈ [0.01, 1], and λG ∈ [0.5, 10].
Convergence. We empirically tested the convergence prop-
erty of CDA. The result in Figure 4 (d) shows that the accu-
racy increases and converges in approximately 5 iterations.
Effect of Outlier Detection. We detect and remove low-
conﬁdence pseudo-labels by setting a threshold of informa-
tion entropy in Eq.1. To show the effectiveness of this pro-

cess, we compared CDA with the CDA without outlier de-
tection. As shown in the second and fourth rows of Table
4, all the tasks signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from this process, which
shows the importance of the outlier detection.

CDA

Effect of Dual Mapping. To map each domain to the
shared latent space, we learn a different transformation ma-
trix for each domain. To compare this fashion with learning
a shared transform matrix for both domains, we conducted
CDA by learning the same transformation matrix for both
domains. The results shown in Table 4 demonstrate the ad-
vantage of dual mapping. This outcome is probably because
dual mapping enables learning more domain-speciﬁc infor-
mation for each domain during the adaptation process.
Other Experiments. We have also performed experiments
on the following aspects: (1) time complexity, (2) effect of
different pseudo-labelling methods, (3) effect of the number
of labeled samples in each domain and (4) effect of overlap-
ping rate of known label spaces between the two domains.
For the sake of space, descriptions and results of these ex-
periments are given in the supplementary material.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced the weakly supervised open-
set domain adaptation problem. This setting extends do-
main adaptation to the scenarios where an ideal source do-
main is absent, and we need to let partially labeled do-
mains learn from each other. To address this problem, we
propose a novel Collaborative Distribution Alignment ap-
proach. Compared to previous works, this study represents
the ﬁrst attempt to enhance overall performance by domain
collaboration. Future works could be undertaken to detect
the unknown-class samples more effectively or to design an
adaptive neural network for end-to-end training.
