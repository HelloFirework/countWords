Abstract

Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerg-
ing technology with a unique capability of capturing indi-
vidual photons with high timing precision. SPADs are be-
ing used in several active imaging systems (e.g., ﬂuores-
cence lifetime microscopy and LiDAR), albeit mostly lim-
ited to low photon ﬂux settings. We propose passive free-
running SPAD (PF-SPAD) imaging, an imaging modality
that uses SPADs for capturing 2D intensity images with un-
precedented dynamic range under ambient lighting, with-
out any active light source. Our key observation is that
the precise inter-photon timing measured by a SPAD can be
used for estimating scene brightness under ambient lighting
conditions, even for very bright scenes. We develop a the-
oretical model for PF-SPAD imaging, and derive a scene
brightness estimator based on the average time of darkness
between successive photons detected by a PF-SPAD pixel.
Our key insight is that due to the stochastic nature of photon
arrivals, this estimator does not suffer from a hard satura-
tion limit. Coupled with high sensitivity at low ﬂux, this
enables a PF-SPAD pixel to measure a wide range of scene
brightnesses, from very low to very high, thereby achieving
extreme dynamic range. We demonstrate an improvement
of over 2 orders of magnitude over conventional sensors by
imaging scenes spanning a dynamic range of 106 : 1.

1. Introduction

Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) can count in-
dividual photons and capture their temporal arrival statis-
tics with very high precision [7]. Due to this capability,
SPADs are widely used in low light scenarios [25, 3, 1],
LiDAR [20, 29] and non-line of sight imaging [6, 12, 26].
In these applications, SPADs are used in synchronization
with an active light source (e.g., a pulsed laser).
In this
paper, we propose passive free-running SPAD (PF-SPAD)
imaging, where SPADs are used in a free-running mode,
with the goal of capturing 2D intensity images of scenes

under passive lighting, without an actively controlled light
source. Although SPADs have so far been limited to low
ﬂux settings, using the timing statistics of photon arrivals,
PF-SPAD imaging can successfully capture much higher
ﬂux levels than previously thought possible.

We build a detailed theoretical model and derive a scene
brightness estimator for PF-SPAD imaging that, unlike a
conventional sensor pixel, does not suffer from full well
capacity limits [11] and can measure high incident ﬂux.
Therefore, a PF-SPAD remains sensitive to incident light
throughout the exposure time, even under very strong inci-
dent ﬂux. This enables imaging scenes with large bright-
ness variations, from extreme dark to very bright. Imagine
an autonomous car driving out of a dark tunnel on a bright
sunny day, or a robot inspecting critical machine parts made
of metal with strong specular reﬂections. These scenarios
require handling large illumination changes, that are often
beyond the capabilities of conventional sensors.

Intriguing Characteristics of PF-SPAD Imaging: Unlike
conventional sensor pixels that have a linear input-output re-
sponse (except past saturation), a PF-SPAD pixel has a non-
linear response curve with an asymptotic saturation limit as
illustrated in Figure 1. After each photon detection event,
the SPAD enters a ﬁxed dead time interval where it cannot
detect additional photons. The non-linear response is a con-
sequence of the PF-SPAD adaptively missing a fraction of
the incident photons as the incident ﬂux increases (see Fig-
ure 1 top-right). Theoretically, a PF-SPAD sensor does not
saturate even at extremely high brightness values. Instead,
it reaches a soft saturation limit beyond which it still stays
sensitive, albeit with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
This soft saturation point is reached considerably past the
saturation limits of conventional sensors, thus, enabling PF-
SPADs to reliably measure high ﬂux values.

Various noise sources in PF-SPAD imaging also exhibit
counter-intuitive behavior. For example, while in conven-
tional imaging, photon noise increases monotonically (as
square-root) with the incident ﬂux, in PF-SPAD imaging,
the photon noise ﬁrst increases with incident ﬂux, and then
decreases after reaching a maximum value, until eventually,
it becomes even lower than the quantization noise. Quanti-
zation noise dominates at very high ﬂux levels. In contrast,
for conventional sensors, quantization noise affects SNR

of sensor pixels. The middle row shows sensor response curves as a function of incident photon ﬂux for a ﬁxed exposure time. At high
ﬂux, a conventional sensor pixel saturates when the full well capacity is reached. A PF-SPAD pixel has a non-linear response curve with
an asymptotic saturation limit and can operate even at extremely high ﬂux levels. The bottom row shows simulated single-capture images
of an HDR scene with a ﬁxed exposure time of 5 ms for both types of sensors. The conventional sensor has a full well capacity of 33,400.
The SPAD has a dead time of 149.7 ns which corresponds to an asymptotic saturation limit equal to 33,400. The hypothetical PF-SPAD
array can simultaneously capture dark and bright regions of the scene in a single exposure time. The PF-SPAD image is for conceptual
illustration only; megapixel PF-SPAD arrays are currently not available.

only at very low ﬂux; and when operating in realistic ﬂux
levels, photon noise dominates other sources of noise.

Extreme Dynamic Range Imaging with PF-SPADs: Due
to their ability to measure high ﬂux levels, combined with
single-photon sensitivity, PF-SPADs can simultaneously
capture a large range of brightness values in a single ex-
posure, making them well suited as high dynamic range
(HDR) imaging sensors. We provide theoretical justiﬁca-
tion for the HDR capability of PF-SPAD imaging by model-
ing its photon detection statistics. We build a hardware pro-
totype and demonstrate single-exposure imaging of scenes
with an extreme dynamic range of 106 : 1, over 2 orders

of magnitude higher than conventional sensors. We envi-
sion that the proposed approach and analysis will expand
the applicability of SPADs as general-purpose, all-lighting-
condition, passive imaging sensors, not limited to special-
ized applications involving low ﬂux conditions or active il-
lumination, and play a key role in applications that witness
extreme variations in ﬂux levels, including astronomy, mi-
croscopy, photography, and computer vision systems.

Scope and Limitations: The goal of this paper is to present
the concept of adaptive temporal binning for passive ﬂux
sensing and related theoretical analysis using a single-pixel
PF-SPAD implementation. Current SPAD technology is

6761

still in a nascent stage, not mature enough to replace con-
ventional CCD and CMOS image sensors. Megapixel PF-
SPAD arrays have not been realized yet. Various technical
design challenges that must be resolved to enable high res-
olution PF-SPAD arrays are beyond the scope of this paper.

2. Related Work

HDR Imaging using Conventional Sensors: The key idea
behind HDR imaging with digital CMOS or CCD sensors is
similar to combination printing [27] — capture more light
from darker parts of the scene to mitigate sensor noise and
less light from brighter parts of the scene to avoid satura-
tion. A widely used computational method called exposure
bracketing [8, 14] captures multiple images of the scene
using different exposure times and blends the pixel values
to generate an HDR image.Exposure bracketing algorithms
can be adapted to the PF-SPAD image formation model to
further increase their dynamic range.
Hardware Modiﬁcations to Conventional Sensors: Spa-
tially varying exposure technique modulates the amount of
light reaching the sensor pixels using ﬁxed [24] or adaptive
[23] light absorbing neutral density ﬁlters. Another method
[31] involves the use of beam-splitters to relay the scene
onto multiple imaging sensors with different exposure set-
tings.
In contrast, our method can provide improved dy-
namic range without having to trade off spatial resolution.
Sensors with Non-Linear Response: Logarithmic image
sensors [19] use additional hardware in each pixel that
applies logarithmic non-linearity to obtain dynamic range
compression. Quanta image sensors (QIS) obtain log-
arithmic dynamic range compression by exploiting ﬁne-
grained (sub-diffraction-limit) spatial statistics,
through
spatial oversampling [33, 10, 9]. We take a different ap-
proach of treating a SPAD as an adaptive temporal binary
sensor which subdivides the total exposure time into ran-
dom non-equispaced time bins at least as long as the dead
time of the SPAD. Experimental results in recent work [2]
have shown the potential of this method for improved dy-
namic range over the QIS approach. Here we provide a
comprehensive theoretical justiﬁcation by deriving the SNR
from ﬁrst principles and also show simulated and experi-
mental imaging results demonstrating dynamic range im-
provements of over two orders of magnitude.

3. Passive Imaging with a Free-Running SPAD

In this section we present an image formation model for
a PF-SPAD and derive a photon ﬂux estimator that relies on
inter-photon detection times and photon counts. This pro-
vides formal justiﬁcation for the notion of adaptive photon
rejection and the asymptotic response curve of a PF-SPAD.
Each PF-SPAD pixel passively measures the photon ﬂux
from a scene point by detecting incident photons over a
ﬁxed exposure time. The time intervals between consec-

utive incident photons vary randomly according to a Pois-
son process [16]. If the difference in the arrival times of
two consecutive photons is less than the SPAD dead time,
the later photon is not detected. The free-running operating
mode means that the PF-SPAD pixel is ready to capture the
next available photon as soon as the dead time interval from
the previous photon detection event elapses1. In this free-
running, passive-capture mode the PF-SPAD pixel acts as a
temporal binary sensor that divides the total exposure time
into random, non-uniformly spaced time intervals, each at
least as long as the dead time. As shown in Figure 1, the PF-
SPAD pixel detects at most one photon within each interval;
additional incident photons during the dead time interval are
not detected. The same ﬁgure also shows that as the aver-
age number of photons incident on a SPAD increases, the
fraction of the number of detected photons decreases.

PF-SPAD Image Formation Model: Suppose the PF-
SPAD pixel is exposed to a constant photon ﬂux of Φ
photons per unit time over a ﬁxed exposure time T . Let
NT denote the total number of photons detected in time
T , and {X1, X2, . . . , XNT −1} denote the inter-detection
time intervals. We deﬁne the average time of darkness as
¯X = 1
i=1 Xi. Intuitively, a larger incident ﬂux
should correspond to a lower average time of darkness, and
vice versa. Based on this intuition, we derive the follow-
ing estimator of the incident ﬂux as a function of ¯X (see
Supplementary Note 1 for derivation):

NT −1�NT −1

ˆΦ =

1

q� ¯X − τd� ,

(1)

where ˆΦ denotes the estimated photon ﬂux, 0 < q < 1
is the photon detection probability of the SPAD pixel, and
τd is the dead time. Note that since Xi ≥ τd ∀ i, the esti-
mator in Equation (1) is positive and ﬁnite. In a practical
implementation, it is often more efﬁcient to use fast count-
ing circuits that only provide a count of the total number
of SPAD detection events in the exposure time interval, in-
stead of storing timestamps for individual detection events.
In this case, the average time of darkness can be approxi-
mated as ¯X ≈ T /NT . The ﬂux estimator that uses only
photon counts is given by:

ˆΦ =

NT

q (T − NT τd)

Interpreting the PF-SPAD Flux Estimator: The photon
ﬂux estimator in Equation (2) is a function of the number of
photons detected by a dead time-limited SPAD pixel and is

example, synchronized with a laser pulse in a LiDAR application, and the
SPAD detects at most one photon for each laser pulse.

valid at all incident ﬂux levels. The image formation pro-
cedure applies this inverse non-linear mapping to the pho-
ton counts from each PF-SPAD pixel to recover ﬂux values,
even for bright parts of the scene. The relationship between
the estimated ﬂux, ˆΦ, and the number of photons detected,
NT , is non-linear, and is similar to the well-known non-
paralyzable detector model used to describe certain radioac-
tive particle detectors [22, 13].

To obtain further insight into the non-linear behaviour of
a SPAD pixel in the free-running mode, it is instructive to
analyze the average number of detected photons as a func-
tion of Φ for a ﬁxed T . Using the theory of renewal pro-
cesses [13] we can show that:

E[NT ] =

qΦT

1 + qΦτd

.

(3)

This non-linear SPAD response curve is shown in Figure 1.
The non-linear behavior is a consequence of the ability of a
SPAD to perform adaptive photon rejection during the ex-
posure time. The shape of the response curve is similar to a
gamma-correction or tone-mapping curve used for display-
ing an HDR image. As a result, the SPAD response curve
provides dynamic range compression, gratis, with no addi-
tional hardware modiﬁcations. The key observation about
Equation (3) is that it has an asymptotic saturation limit
given by limΦ→∞ E[NT ] = T /τd. Therefore, in theory,
the photon counts never saturate because this asymptotic
limit can only be achieved with an inﬁnitely bright light
source. In practice, as we discuss in the following sections,
due to the inherent quantized nature of photon counts, the
estimator in Equation (2) suffers from a soft saturation phe-
nomenon at high ﬂux levels and limits the SNR.

4. Peculiar Noise Characteristics of PF-SPADs

In this section, we list various noise sources that affect
a PF-SPAD pixel, derive mathematical expressions for the
bias and variance they introduce in the total photon counts,
and provide intuition on their surprising, counter-intuitive
characteristics as compared to a conventional pixel. Ulti-
mately, the ﬂux estimation performance limits will be de-
termined by the cumulative effect of these sources of noise
as a function of the incident photon ﬂux.

Shot Noise: For a conventional image sensor, due to Pois-
son distribution of photon arrivals, the variance of shot noise
is proportional to the incident photon ﬂux [16], as shown in
Figure 2. A PF-SPAD, however, adaptively rejects a frac-
tion of the incident photons during the dead time. There-
fore, although the incident photons follow Poisson statis-
tics, the photon counts (number of detected photons) do not.
We deﬁne shot noise for PF-SPADs as the variance in the
detected number of photon counts. This is approximately

Figure 2. Effect of various sources of noise on variance of PF-
SPAD photon counts. For a PF-SPAD pixel, the variance in pho-
ton counts due to quantization remains constant at all ﬂux levels.
The variance due to shot noise ﬁrst increases and then decreases
with increasing incident ﬂux. At the soft saturation point, quan-
tization exceeds shot noise variance. For a conventional pixel,
quantization noise remains small and constant until the full well
capacity is reached, where it jumps to inﬁnity. Shot noise variance
increases monotonically with incident ﬂux.

given by (see Supplementary Note 2):

Var[NT ] =

q Φ T

(1 + q Φ τd)3 .

(4)

As shown in Figure 2, the variance ﬁrst increases as a func-
tion of incident ﬂux, reaches a maximum and then decreases
at very high ﬂux levels. This peculiar behavior can be un-
derstood intuitively from the PF-SPAD photon detection
timelines in Figure 1 and observing how the dead time inter-
vals are spread within the exposure time. At low ﬂux, when
Φ � 1/τd, the dead time windows, on average, have large
intervening time gaps. So the detected photon count statis-
tics behave approximately like a conventional image sensor
with Poisson statistics: Var[NT ] ≈ qΦT . This explains
the monotonically increasing trend in variance at low ﬂux.
However, for large incident ﬂux Φ � 1/τd the time of dark-
ness between consecutive dead time windows becomes suf-
ﬁciently small that the PF-SPAD detects a photon soon after
the preceding dead time interval expires. This causes a de-
crease in randomness which manifests as a monotonically
decreasing photon count variance. In theory, as Φ → ∞
the process becomes deterministic with zero variance: the
PF-SPAD detects exactly one photon per dead time window.

Quantization Noise and Saturation: For a PF-SPAD,
since the photon counts are always integer valued,
the
source of quantization noise is inherent in the measurement

6763

process. As a ﬁrst order approximation, this can be modeled
as being uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1] which
has a variance of 1/12 for all incident ﬂux levels.2 A surpris-
ing consequence of the monotonically decreasing behavior
of PF-SPAD shot noise is that at sufﬁciently high photon
ﬂux, quantization noise exceeds shot noise and becomes the
dominant source of noise. This shown in Figure 2 (zoomed
inset). We refer to this phenomenon as soft saturation, and
discuss this in more detail in the next section.

In contrast, for a conventional imaging sensor, quan-
tization noise is often ignored at high incident ﬂux lev-
els because state of the art CMOS and CCD sensors
have analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) with sufﬁcient bit
depths. However, these sensors suffer from full well ca-
pacity limits beyond which they can no longer detect inci-
dent photons. As shown in Figure 2, we incorporate this
hard saturation limit into quantization noise by allowing the
quantization variance to jump to inﬁnity when the full well
capacity is reached.

Dark Count and Afterpulsing Noise: Dark counts are spu-
rious counts caused by thermally generated electrons and
can be modeled as a Poisson process with rate Φdark, in-
dependent of the true photon arrivals. Afterpulsing noise
refers to spurious counts caused due to charged carriers that
remain trapped in the SPAD from preceding photon detec-
tions. In most modern SPAD detectors dark counts and af-
terpulsing effects are usually negligible and can be ignored.

Effect of Noise on Scene Brightness Estimation: Since
the output of a conventional sensor pixel is linear in the
incident brightness, the variance in estimated brightness is
simply equal (up to a constant scaling factor) to the noise
variance. This is not the case for a PF-SPAD pixel due to its
non-linear response curve — the variance in photon counts
due to different sources of noise must be converted to a
variance in brightness estimates, by accounting for the non-
linear dependence of ˆΦ on NT in Equation (2). This raises
a natural question: Given the various noise sources that af-
fect the photon counts obtained from a PF-SPAD pixel, how
reliable is the estimated scene brightness?

5. Extreme Dynamic Range of PF-SPADs

The various sources of noise in a PF-SPAD pixel de-
scribed in the previous section cause the estimated photon
ﬂux ˆΦ to deviate from the true value Φ. In this section we
derive mathematical expressions for the bias and variance
introduced by these different sources of noise in the PF-
SPAD ﬂux estimate. The cumulative effect of these errors
is captured in the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) metric:

RMSE( ˆΦ) =�E[( ˆΦ − Φ)2],

2For exact theoretical analysis refer to Supplementary Note 3.

the
where the expectation operation averages over all
sources of noise in the SPAD pixel. Using the bias-variance
decomposition, the RMSE of the PF-SPAD ﬂux estimator
can be decomposed as a sum of ﬂux estimation errors from
the different sources of noise:

RMSE( ˆΦ) =�(Φdark +Bap)2 +Vshot +Vquantization . (5)

The variance in the estimated ﬂux due to shot noise (Equa-
tion (4)) is given by:

Vshot =

Φ(1 + qΦτd)

qT

.

The variance in estimated ﬂux due to quantization is:

Vquantization =

(1 + qΦτd)4

12q2T 2

.

(6)

(7)

The dark count bias Φdark depends on the operating temper-
ature. Finally, the afterpulsing bias Bap can be expressed in
terms of the afterpulsing probability pap:

Bap = pap qΦ (1 + Φτd)e−qΦτd .

(8)

See Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Note 3 for
detailed derivations of Equations (6–8).

Figure 3(a) shows the ﬂux estimation errors introduced
by the various noise sources as a function of the incident
ﬂux levels for a conventional and a PF-SPAD pixel.3 The
performance of the PF-SPAD ﬂux estimator can be ex-
pressed in terms of its SNR, formally deﬁned as the ratio
of the true photon ﬂux to the RMSE of the estimated ﬂux
[33]:

SNR(Φ) = 20 log10�

Φ

RMSE( ˆΦ)� .

(9)

By substituting the expressions for various noise sources
from Equations (5-7) into Equation (9), we get an expres-
sion for the SNR of the SPAD-based ﬂux estimator shown
in Equation (10). Figure 3(b) shows the theoretical SNR
as a function of incident ﬂux for the PF-SPAD ﬂux esti-
mator, and a conventional sensor. A conventional sensor
suffers from an abrupt drop in SNR due to hard saturation
(see Supplementary Note 5). In contrast, the SNR achieved
by a SPAD sensor degrades gracefully, even beyond the soft
saturation point.

The Soft Saturation Phenomenon: It is particularly in-
structive to observe the behavior of quantization noise for
the SPAD pixel. Although the quantization noise in the de-
tected photon counts remains small and constant at all ﬂux

3The effects of dark counts and afterpulsing noise are usually negligible
and are discussed in Supplementary Note 4 and shown in Supplementary
Figure 1.

Figure 3. Signal-to-noise ratio of a PF-SPAD pixel. (a) A PF-SPAD pixel suffers from quantization noise, which results in ﬂux estimation
error that increases as a function of incident ﬂux. Beyond a ﬂux level denoted as “soft saturation,” quantization becomes the dominant noise
source overtaking shot noise. In contrast, for conventional sensors, quantization and read noise remain constant while shot noise increases
with incident ﬂux. (b) Unlike a conventional sensor, a PF-SPAD sensor does not suffer from a hard saturation limit. A soft saturation
response leads to a graceful drop in SNR at high photon ﬂux, leading to a high dynamic range. (c) An experimental SNR plot obtained

levels, the variance in the estimated ﬂux due to quantization
increases monotonically with incident ﬂux. This is due to
the non-linear nature of the estimator in Equation (2). At
high incident ﬂux levels, a single additional detected photon
maps to a large range of estimated ﬂux values, resulting in
large errors in estimated ﬂux. We call this phenomenon soft
saturation. Beyond the soft saturation ﬂux level, quantiza-
tion dominates all other noise sources, including shot noise.
The soft saturation limit, however, is reached at consider-
ably higher ﬂux levels as compared to the hard saturation
limit of conventional sensors, thus, enabling PF-SPADs to
reliably estimate very high ﬂux levels.

Effect of Varying Exposure Time: For conventional imag-
ing sensors, increasing the exposure time causes the sensor
pixel to saturate at a lower value of the incident ﬂux level.
This is equivalent to a horizontal translation of the conven-
tional sensor’s SNR curve in Figure 3(b). This does not af-
fect its dynamic range. However, for a PF-SPAD pixel, the
asymptotic saturation limit increases linearly with the expo-
sure time, hence increasing the SNR at all ﬂux levels. This
leads to a remarkable behavior of increasing the dynamic
range of a PF-SPAD pixel with increasing exposure time.
See Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Figure 2.

Simulated Megapixel PF-SPAD Imaging System: Fig-
ure 1 (bottom row) shows simulated images for a con-
ventional megapixel image sensor array and a hypothetical
megapixel PF-SPAD array. The ground truth photon ﬂux

image was obtained from an exposure bracketed HDR im-
age captured using a Canon EOS Rebel T5 DSLR camera
with 10 stops rescaled to cover a dynamic range of 106 : 1.
An exposure time of T = 5 ms was used to simulate both
images. For fair comparison, the SPAD dead time was set
to 149.7 ns, which corresponds to an asymptotic saturation
limit of T/τd = 34 000, equal to the conventional sensor full
well capacity. The quantum efﬁciencies of the conventional
sensor and PF-SPAD were set to 90% and 40%. Observe
that the PF-SPAD can simultaneously capture details in the
dark regions of the scene (e.g. the text in the shadow) and
bright regions in the sun-lit sky. The conventional sensor
array exhibits saturation artifacts in the bright regions of the
scene. (See Supplementary Note 7).

The human eye has a unique ability to adapt to a wide
range of brightness levels ranging from a bright sunny day
down to single photon levels [4, 30]. Conventional sensors
cannot simultaneously reliably capture very dark and very
bright regions in many natural scenes. In contrast, a PF-
SPAD can simultaneously image dark and bright regions of
the scene in a single exposure. Additional simulation results
are shown in Supplementary Figures 7–9.

6. Experimental Results

SNR and Dynamic Range of a Single-Pixel PF-SPAD:
Figure 3(c) shows experimental SNR measurements using
our prototype single-pixel SPAD sensor together with the

6765

SNR predicted by our theoretical model. Our hardware pro-
totype has an additional 6 ns jitter introduced by the digi-
tal electronics that control the dead time window duration.
This is not included in the SNR curve of Figure 3(b) but is
accounted for in the theoretical SNR curve shown in Fig-
ure 3(c). See Supplementary Note 8 for details. We de-
ﬁne dynamic range as the ratio of largest to smallest photon
ﬂux values that can be measured above a speciﬁed minimum
SNR. Assuming a minimum acceptable SNR of 30 dB, the
SPAD pixel achieves a dynamic range improvement of over
2 orders of magnitude compared to a conventional sensor.

Figure 4. Experimental single-pixel PF-SPAD imaging system.
A free-running SPAD is mounted on two translation stages to
raster-scan the image plane. There is no active light source—the
PF-SPAD passively measures ambient light in the scene. Photon
counts are captured using a single-photon counting module (not
shown) operated without a synchronization signal.

Point-Scanning Setup: The imaging setup shown in Fig-
ure 4 consists of a SPAD module mounted on a pair of
micro-translation stages (VT-21L Micronix USA) to raster-
scan the image plane of a variable focal length lens (Fu-
jiﬁlm DV3.4x3.8SA-1). Photon counts were recorded us-
ing a single-photon counting module (PicoQuant Hydra-
Harp 400), with the SPAD in the free-running mode.
A monochrome machine vision camera (FLIR GS3-U3-
23S6M-C) was used for qualitative comparisons with the
images acquired using the SPAD setup. The machine vi-
sion camera uses the same variable focal length lens with
identical ﬁeld of view as the scene imaged by the SPAD
point-scanning setup. This ensures a comparable effective
incident ﬂux on a per-pixel basis for both the SPAD and
the machine vision camera. The sensor pixel parameters are
identical to those used in simulations. Images captured with
the machine vision camera were downsampled to match the
resolution of the raster-scanned PF-SPAD images.

Extreme HDR: Results of single-shot HDR images from
our raster-scanning PF-SPAD prototype are shown in Fig-

ure 5 and Supplementary Figure 10, for different scenes
spanning a wide dynamic range (≥ 106 : 1) of brightness
values. To reliably visualize the wide range of brightnesses
in these scenes, three different tone-mapping algorithms
were used to tone-map the main ﬁgures, the dark zoomed
insets and the bright zoomed insets, respectively. The ma-
chine vision camera fails to capture bright text outside the
tunnel (Fig. 5(a)) and dark text in the tunnel (Fig. 5(b)) in
a single exposure interval. The PF-SPAD successfully cap-
tures the entire dynamic range (Fig. 5(c)). In Fig. 5(f), the
PF-SPAD even captures the bright ﬁlament of an incandes-
cent bulb simultaneously with dark text in the shadow. The
halo artifacts in Figure 5(d–f) are due to a local adaptation-
based non-invertible tone-map that was used to simultane-
ously visualize the bright ﬁlament and the dark text. This
ability of the PF-SPAD ﬂux estimator to capture a wide
range of ﬂux from very low to high in a single capture can
have implications in many applications [21, 5, 32, 17]. that
require extreme dynamic range.

7. Discussion

Quanta Image Sensor: An alternative realization [18] of a
SPAD-based imaging sensor divides the total exposure time
T into uniformly spaced intervals of duration τb ≥ τd. This
“uniform-binning” method leads to a different image for-
mation model which is known in literature as the oversam-
pled binary image sensor [33] or quanta image sensor (QIS)
[10, 9]. In Supplementary Note 9, we show that in theory,
this uniform-binning implementation has a smaller dynamic
range as compared to a PF-SPAD that allows the dead time
windows to shift adaptively [2]. Note, however, that state of
the art QIS technology provides much higher resolution and
ﬁll factor with high quantum efﬁciencies, and lower read
noise than current SPAD arrays.

Limitations and Future Outlook: Our proof-of-concept
imaging system uses a SPAD that is not optimized for op-
erating in the free-running mode. The duration of the dead
time window, which is a crucial parameter in our ﬂux esti-
mator, is not stable in current SPAD implementations (such
as silicon photo-multipliers) as it is not crucial for active
time-of-ﬂight applications. Various research and engineer-
ing challenges must be met to realize a high resolution
SPAD-based passive image sensor. State of the art SPAD
pixel arrays that are commercially available today consist of
thousands of pixels with row or column multiplexed readout
capabilities and do not support fully parallel readout. Cur-
rent SPAD arrays also have very low ﬁll factors due to the
need of integrating counting and storage electronics within
each pixel [28, 15]. Our method and results make a case
for developing high resolution fabrication and 3D stack-
ing techniques that will enable high ﬁll-factor SPAD arrays,
which can be used as general purpose, passive sensors for
applications requiring extreme dynamic range imaging.

Figure 5. Experimental comparison of the dynamic range of a CMOS camera and PF-SPAD imaging. The two imaged scenes have
a wide range of brightness values (1,000,000:1), considerably beyond the dynamic range of conventional sensors. (a, d) Images captured
using a 12-bit CMOS machine vision camera with a long exposure time of 5 ms. Bright regions appear saturated. (b, e) Images of the same
scenes with a short exposure time of 0.5 ms. Darker regions appear grainy and severely underexposed, making it challenging to read the
text on the signs and the numbers on the alarm clock. (c, f) PF-SPAD images of the same scenes captured using a single 5 ms exposure per
pixel. Our hardware prototype captures the full range of brightness levels in the scenes in a single shot. The text is visible in both bright
and dark regions of the scene, and details in regions of high ﬂux, such as the ﬁlament of the bulb, can be recovered. For fair comparison,
the main images were tone-mapped using the same tone-mapping algorithm.
