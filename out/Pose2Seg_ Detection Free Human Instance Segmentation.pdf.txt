Abstract

The standard approach to image instance segmentation
is to perform the object detection ﬁrst, and then segment
the object from the detection bounding-box. More recently,
deep learning methods like Mask R-CNN [14] perform them
jointly. However, little research takes into account the
uniqueness of the “human” category, which can be well
deﬁned by the pose skeleton. Moreover, the human pose
skeleton can be used to better distinguish instances with
heavy occlusion than using bounding-boxes.
In this pa-
per, we present a brand new pose-based instance segmen-
tation framework1 for humans which separates instances
based on human pose, rather than proposal region de-
tection. We demonstrate that our pose-based framework
can achieve better accuracy than the state-of-art detection-
based approach on the human instance segmentation prob-
lem, and can moreover better handle occlusion. Further-
more, there are few public datasets containing many heavily
occluded humans along with comprehensive annotations,
which makes this a challenging problem seldom noticed by
researchers. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a new
benchmark “Occluded Human (OCHuman)”2, which fo-
cuses on occluded humans with comprehensive annotations
including bounding-box, human pose and instance masks.
This dataset contains 8110 detailed annotated human in-
stances within 4731 images. With an average 0.67 Max-
IoU for each person, OCHuman is the most complex and
challenging dataset related to human instance segmenta-
tion. Through this dataset, we want to emphasize occlusion
as a challenging problem for researchers to study.

1. Introduction

In recent years, research related to “humans” in the
computer vision community has become increasingly ac-
tive because of the high demand for real-life applications.
There has been much good research in the ﬁelds of human
pose estimation [1, 2, 6, 14, 20, 26, 40], pedestrian detec-
tion [25, 41, 42], portrait segmentation [35, 36, 37], and face
recognition [18, 23, 24, 27, 39, 43, 44], much of which has
already produced practical value in real life. This paper fo-
cuses on multi-person pose estimation and human instance
segmentation, and proposes a pose-based human instance
segmentation framework.

General Object Instance Segmentation is a challenging
problem which aims to predict pixel-level labels for each
object instance in the image. Currently, those instance seg-
mentation methods with highest accuracy [3, 14, 19, 30]
are all based on powerful object detection baseline meth-
ods, such as Fast/Faster R-CNN [9, 33], YOLO [32], which
mostly follow a basic rule: ﬁrst generate a large number of
proposal regions, then remove the redundant regions using
Non-maximum Suppression (NMS). However, when two ob-
jects of the same category have a large overlap, NMS will
treat one of them as a redundant proposal region and elim-
inates it. This means that almost all the object detection
methods cannot deal with the situation of large overlaps.
Moreover, even if the detection methods sometimes suc-
cessfully detect two instances, the bounding-box is not suit-
able for instance segmentation in occluded cases. If two in-

1889

stances are heavily intertwined, they will both appear in the
same bounding-box (like the case in Figure 1), which makes
it hard for the segmentation network to identify which in-
stance should be the target in this Region of Interest (RoI).
However, “human” is a special category in the computer
vision community, and can be well deﬁned by the pose
skeleton. As shown in Figure 1, Human pose skeletons
are more suitable for distinguishing two heavily intertwined
people, because they can provide more distinct information
about a person than bounding-boxes, such as the location
and visibility of different body parts. Multi-Person Pose
Estimation is also a very active topic in recent years, and
there is already good progress [1, 2, 6, 16, 26, 29] on tack-
ling this problem. Although object detection methods are
widely used by many multi-person pose estimation frame-
works, some powerful bottom-up methods [1, 26] which
do not rely on object detection also achieved good perfor-
mance, including the COCO keypoints challenge 2016 win-
ner [1]. The main idea of the bottom-up methods is to ﬁrst
detect keypoints for each body part for all the people, and
then group or connect those parts to form several instances
of human pose, which makes it possible to seperate two in-
tertwined human instances with a large overlap. Based on
this observation, we present a new pose-based instance seg-
mentation framework for humans which separates instances
based on human pose rather than region proposal detection.
Our pose-based framework works seamlessly with existing
bottom-up pose estimation methods, and works better than
the detection-based framework, especially in the case of oc-
clusion.

Generally, there is an align module in the instance seg-
mentation framework, for example, RoI-Align in Mask R-
CNN. The align module is used to crop the objects from the
image using detection bounding boxes, and resize the ob-
jects to a uniform scale. Since it is hard to ﬁnd a bounding
box accurately from the object using human pose, we pro-
posed an align module based on human pose, called Afﬁne-
Align, which is a combination of scale, translation, rotation
and left-right ﬂip. An extra advantage of using Afﬁne-Align
is that we can correct some objects with strange poses to a
standard pose, like the inverted skiing human in Figure 2.

Additionally, the human pose and human mask are not
independent. Human pose can be approximately considered
as a skeleton of the mask of the human instance. So we ex-
plicitly use human pose to guide the segmentation module
by concatenating the Skeleton features to the instance fea-
ture map after Afﬁne-Align. Our experiments demonstrate
our Skeleton features not only help to improve the accuracy
of segmentation, but also give our network the ability to
easily distinguish different instances that are heavily inter-
twined in the same RoI.

Severe occlusion between human bodies is often encoun-
tered in life, but current human-related public datasets ei-
ther do not contain many severe occlusion situations [5, 8,
21], or lack comprehensive annotations of the human in-

box-based 
alignment

stances [34]. Therefore, we introduce a new benchmark
“Occluded Human (OCHuman)” in this paper, which fo-
cuses on heavily occluded humans with comprehensive an-
notations including bounding-boxes, human poses and in-
stance masks. This dataset contains 8110 detailed annotated
human instances within 4731 images. On average, over
67% of the bounding-box area of a human is occluded by
one or several other persons, which makes this dataset the
most complex and challenging dataset related to humans.
Through this dataset, we want to emphasize occlusion as
a challenging problem for researchers to study, and encour-
age current algorithms to become more practical for real life
situations.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We propose a brand new pose-based human instance
segmentation framework which works better than the
detection-based framework, especially in cases with
occlusion.

• We propose a pose-based align module, called Afﬁne-
Align, which can align image windows into a uniform
scale and direction based on human pose.

• We explicitly use artiﬁc human Skeleton features to
guide the segmentation module and achieve a further
improvement of the segmentation accuracy.

• We introduce a new benchmark OCHuman which fo-
cuses on the heavy occlusion problem, with compre-
hensive annotations including bounding-boxes, human
poses and instance masks.

2. Related Work

2.1. Multi Person Pose Estimation

Top-down methods [2, 6, 14, 16, 29] ﬁrst employ ob-
ject detection to crop each person, and then use a single-
person pose estimation method on each human instance,
which makes them all suffer from the defects of object de-
tection methods on heavy occlusion. While other bottom-up
methods [1, 17, 26, 31] ﬁrst detect body part keypoints of
all the people, and then cluster these parts into instances

Figure 3: Samples of our OCHuman dataset. All the annotated people in this dataset are heavily occluded with others, and
have comprehensive annotations.

of human pose. Pishchulin et al. [31] propose a complex
framework of partitioning and labeling body-parts gener-
ated using a CNN. They solve the problem as an integer
linear program, and jointly generate the detection and pose
estimation results. Insafutdinov et al. [17] use Resnet [15]
to improve precision, and propose image-conditioned pair-
wise terms to increase speed. Cao et al. [1] use knowledge
of the human structure, and predict a keypoints heatmap and
PAFs, and ﬁnally connect the body parts. Newell et al. [26]
design a tag score map for each body part and use the score
map to group body part keypoints.

2.2. Instance Segmentation

Some works [4, 10, 12, 13] employ a multi-stage pipeline
which ﬁrst uses detection to generate bounding boxes and
then applies semantic segmentation. Others [3, 19, 22, 30]
employ a tighter integration of detection and segmentation,
e.g.
jointly and simultaneously performing detection and
segmentation in an end-to-end framework [19]. Mask R-
CNN [14] is the state-of-art performing framework on the
COCO [21] dataset competition.

2.3. Harnessing Human Pose Estimation for In 

stance Segmentation

There are three typical works that combine human
pose estimation and instance segmentation. Mask R-
CNN [14] approach detects objects while generating in-
stance segmentation and human pose estimation simulta-
neously in a single framework. But in their work, Mask
R-CNN [14] with mask-only performs better than com-
bining keypoints and masks in the instance segmentation
task. Pose2Instance [38] proposes a cascade network to
harness human pose estimation for instance segmentation.
Both of these two works rely on human detection, and per-
form poorly when two bounding boxes have a large overlap.
More recently, PersonLab [28] treats instance segmentation
as a pixel-wise clustering problem, and use human pose to
reﬁne the clustering results. Although their method is not
based on bounding-box detection, they cannot perform as
well as Mask R-CNN [14] in the segmentation task.

3. Occluded Human Benchmark

Our “Occluded Human (OCHuman)” dataset contains
8110 human instances within 4731 images. Each human
instance is heavily occluded by one or several others. We
use MaxIoU to measure the severity of an object being oc-
cluded, which means the max IoU with other same category
objects in a single image. Those instances with MaxIoU
>0.5 are referred to as heavy occlusion, and are selected to
form this dataset. Figure 3 shows some samples from this
dataset. With an average of 0.67 MaxIoU for each person,
OCHuman is the most challenging dataset related to human
instances. Moreover, OCHuman also has rich annotations.
Each instance is annotated with a bounding-box for object
detection, an instance binary mask for instance segmenta-
tion and 17 body joint locations for pose estimation. All
images are collected from real-world scenarios containing
people with challenging poses and viewpoints, various ap-
pearances and in a wide range of resolutions. With OCHu-
man, we provide a new benchmark for the problem of oc-
clusion.

3.1. Annotations

For each image we ﬁrst annotate the bounding-box of
all humans present. Then we calculate the IoU between all
the person pairs, and mark those persons with MaxIoU>0.5
as heavily occluded instances. Finally, we provide extra
information for those occluded instance. The OCHuman
dataset contains three kinds of annotations related to hu-
mans: bounding-boxes, instance binary masks and 17 body
joint locations. We reference the deﬁnition of body joints
from [21], which are eye, nose, ear, shoulder, elbow, wrist,
hip, knee and ankle. Except for the nose, all other joints
have distinct left and right instances.

3.2. Dataset Splits

OCHuman dataset is designed for validation and test-
ing. Since all the instances in this dataset are heavily oc-
cluded by other instances, we consider it is better to use
general datasets such as COCO [21] as a training set, then
test the robustness of the segmentation methods to occlu-
sion using this dataset, rather than performing training on

only occluded cases. We split our dataset into separate val-
idation and test sets. Following random selection, we arrive
at a unique split consisting of 2500 validation and 2231 test-
ing image, containing 4313 and 3797 instances respectively.
Furthermore, we divide instances in OCHuman dataset into
two subsets: OCHuman-Moderate and OCHuman-Hard.
The ﬁrst subset contains instances with MaxIoU in the range
of 0.5 and 0.75, while the second contains instances with
MaxIoU larger than 0.75, making it the more challenging
subset. With these two subsets, we can evaluate the abil-
ity of algorithms to handle occlusions of different levels of
severity.

3.3. Dataset Statistics

We compare our dataset with the person part of COCO
in Table. 1, which is currently the largest public dataset that
contains both instance masks and human pose key-points.
Although COCO includes comprehensive annotations, it
contains few occluded human cases, and so this dataset can-
not help to evaluate the capability of methods when faced
with occlusion. OCHuman is designed for all three most
important tasks related to humans: detection, pose estima-
tion and instance segmentation. It is the most challenging
benchmark because of its heavy occlusion.

4. Approach

4.1. Overview

Our overall structure is shown in Figure 4, which takes
both the image and the human pose as input. Firstly, a base
network is used to extract the features of the image. Then an
align module, called Afﬁne-Align, is used to align RoIs to a
uniform size, which is 64×64 in this paper, based on the hu-
man pose. In the meantime, we generate Skeleton features
for each human instance and concatenate them to the RoIs.
Our segmentation module, which we called SegModule, is
designed based on the same residual unit in Resnet [15]. We
carry out experiments on how the depth of SegModule con-
tributes to the performance of this system in Section 5.3.3.
Finally, we use the estimated matrices in Afﬁne-Align oper-
ation to reverse the alignment for each instance and get the
ﬁnal segmentation results. We describes our Afﬁne-Align
operation, Skeleton features and SegModule in the follow-
ing subsections.

4.2. Afﬁne Align Operation

Our Afﬁne-Align operation is inspired by the RoI-
Pooling in Faster R-CNN [33] and RoI-Align in Mask R-
CNN [14]. But unlike them, we align the people based
on human pose instead of bounding-boxes. Speciﬁcally, as
shown in Figure 4(a), we ﬁrst cluster the poses in the dataset
and use the center of each cluster as pose templates, to rep-
resent the standard poses in the dataset. Then for each pose
detected in the image, we estimate the afﬁne transformation
matrix H between it and the templates, and chose the best
H based on the transformation error. Finally, we apply H
to the image or features and transform it to the desired res-
olution using bilinear interpolation. Details are introduced
below.

4.2.1 Human Pose Representation

Human poses are represented as a list of vectors. Let vec-
tor P = (C1, C2, ..., Cm) ∈ Rm×3 represent the pose of a
single person, where Ci = (x, y, v) ∈ R3 is a 3D vector
representing the coordinates of a single part (such as right-
shoulder, left-ankle) and the visibility of this body joint. m
is a dataset related parameter meaning the total number of
parts in a single pose, which is 17 in COCO.

4.2.2 Pose Templates

We cluster the pose templates from the training set to best
represent the distribution of various human poses. We use
K-means clustering [7] to cluster the poses (P1, P2, ..., Pn)
into k(≤ n) sets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sk} by optimizing Eq. 1,
in which Pµi is the mean of poses in Si. We deﬁne the dis-
tance between two human poses using Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, with
several preprocessing steps: (1) We ﬁrst crop a square-RoI
of each instance using its bounding-box, and put the target
into the center of the RoI, along with its pose coordinates.
(2) We resize this square-RoI to 1 × 1, so that the pose coor-
dinates are all normalized to (0, 1). (3) We only count those
poses which contain more than 8 valid points in the dataset
to serve our purpose of creating the pose templates. Poses
with few valid points cannot provide effective information
and would act as outliers during K-means clustering.

After K-means, we use the mean value of each set Pµi to
form the pose template and use it to represent the whole
group. We set those body joints with v > 0.5 in Pµi as valid
points. Clustering results with different values of K on the
COCO training set are shown in Figure 5. Although the re-
sults of K-means are heavily reliant on initialization values,
our multiple experimental results remain the same, which
shows that there is a strong distinction between different
sets of human poses. After careful observation of those pose
templates, we can ﬁnd the two most frequent human poses
in COCO are a half-body pose and a full-body pose, which
is in line with our common sense view of daily life. When
K = 3 in K-means, we get a half-body pose, a full-body
backview and a full-body frontview. When K ≥ 4, the
difference between left and right are introduced. Since our
align process copes with the left-right ﬂip, K ≥ 4 seems un-
necessary for our framework. So ﬁnally, we choose K = 3
to cluster pose templates in our approach.

4.2.3 Estimate Afﬁne Transformation Matrix

Let vector Pµ represent a pose template, and P represent
a single person pose estimation result. We optimize Eq. 4
to estimate an afﬁne transformation matrix H which trans-
forms the pose coordinates to be as near as possible to the
template coordinates. H is a 2 × 3 matrix with 5 indepen-
dent variables: rotation, scale factor, x-axis translation, y-
axis translation and whether to do left-right ﬂip. Since we
have K templates, we deﬁne a score for each H ∗ based on
the optimized error value, calculated by Eq. 5, to choose
the best template for each estimated pose, as shown in Fig-
ure 4(a).
In order to get the unique solution from Eq. 4,
Pµ and P must contain at least three valid points in com-
mon, which can provide at least 6 independent equations
for optimizing Eq. 4.
If none of our pose templates sat-
isfy this condition, such as the case where there is only one
valid point in P , the estimated transformation matrix H ∗
will be calculated to align the whole image to the desired
solution. In most case, this is reasonable because situations
lacking valid points in the image mostly correspond to a
single, large person in the image.

4.3. Skeleton Features

Figure 4(b) shows our Skeleton features. We adopt the
part afﬁnity ﬁelds (PAFs) from [1], which is a 2-channel
vector ﬁeld map for each skeleton. We use PAFs to repre-
sent the skeleton structure of a human pose. With 19 skele-
tons deﬁned in the COCO dataset, PAFs is a 38-channel
feature map for each human pose instance. We also use
part conﬁdence maps for body parts to emphasize the im-
portance of those regions around the body part keypoints.
For the COCO dataset, each human pose has a 17-channel
part conﬁdence map and a 38-channel PAFs map. So the
total number of channels in our Skeleton features is 55 for
each human instance.

Figure 6: Our method’s results vs. Mask R-CNN [14] on occlusion cases. Bounding-boxes in our results are generated using
predicted masks for better visualization and comparison.

4.4. SegModule

Since we introduced Skeleton features after alignment
to artiﬁcially extend the image features, Our segmentation
module, which we called SegModule, needs to have enough
receptive ﬁelds to not only fully understand these artiﬁcial
features, but also learn the connections between them and
the image features extracted by the base network. There-
fore, we design SegModule based on the resolution of the
aligned RoIs. Figure 4(c) demonstrates the overall architec-
ture of our SegModule. It starts with a 7 × 7, stride-2 con-
volution layer, and is followed by several standard residual
units [15] to achieve a large enough receptive ﬁeld for the
RoIs. After that, a bilinear upsampling layer is used to re-
store the resolution, and another residual unit, along with a
1 × 1 convolution layer are used to predict the ﬁnal result.
Such a structure with 10 residual units can achieve about
50 pixels of receptive ﬁeld, corresponding to our alignment
size of 64 × 64. Fewer units will make the network less ca-
pable of learning, and more units enable little improvement
on the learning ability. Table 4 shows our experiment on
this.

5. Experiments

We evaluate our proposed method on two datasets: (1)
OCHuman, which is the largest validation dataset that is
focused on heavily occluded humans, and proposed in
this paper; and (2) COCOPersons (the person category of
COCO) [21], which contains the most common scenarios
in daily life. Note that the Small category persons in COCO
is not contained in COCOPersons due to the lack of anno-
tations of human pose.

As far as we know, there are few public datasets which
have labels for both human pose and human instance seg-
mentation. COCO is the largest dataset that meets both of
these requirements, so all of our models are trained end-to-
end on the COCOPersons training set with the annotations
of pose keypoints and segmentation masks. We compare
our methods with Mask-RCNN [14], the well known de-
tection based instance segmentation framework. For Mask-
RCNN [14], we use the author’s released code and conﬁg-
urations from [11], and retrained and evaluate the model on

the same dataset as our method. Our framework is imple-
mented using Pytorch. The input resolution of our frame-
work is 512 × 512 in all experiments. All our models are
trained using the same training schedule, which is started
by learningrate = 2e − 4, decayed by 0.1 after 33 epochs,
and ended after 40 epochs. Each model is trained on a sin-
gle TITAN X (Pascal) with batchsize = 4 for 80 hours.
No special techniques are used, such as iterative training,
online hard-case mining, or multi-GPU synchronized batch
normalization. Our method with images and keypoints as
inputs can run about 20 FPS on a TITAX X (Pascal).

5.1. Performance on occlusion

In this experiment, we evaluate our method’s capacity for
handling occlusion cases compared with Mask-RCNN [14]
on the OCHuman dataset. All methods in this experiment
are trained on COCOPersons, including our keypoint de-
tector baseline [26] which achieves 0.285 / 0.303 AP on
the keypoints task of OCHuman val / test set. As shown
in Table 2, based on this keypoint detector baseline, our
framework can achieve nearly 50% higher than the perfor-
mance of Mask R-CNN [14] on this dataset. In addition,
we test the upper limits of our pose-based framework using
ground-truth (GT) keypoints as input, and more than double
the accuracy. This demonstrates that with a better keypoint
detector our framework can perform far better on occlusion
problems. Some results are shown in Figure 6.

5.2. Performance on general cases

In this experiment, we evaluate our model on the CO-
COPerson validation set using groundtruth keypoints as in-
put, and get 0.582 AP on the instance segmentation task.
We also evaluate the performance of our model under the
predicted pose keypoints using our keypoint detector base-
line [26], and achieve 0.555 AP. Mask R-CNN [14] can only
achieve 0.532 AP on this same dataset. We further compare
our results with a recent work, PersonLab [28]. Scores of
PersonLab [28] are taken from their paper, in which the de-
tector is trained and tested on the whole person category
of COCO. For fair comparison, we only compare against
the results of the Median and Large categories. Our results
surpass theirs with a heavier backbone and multi-scale pre-

some results of our instance segmentation framework and

5.3. Ablation Experiments

5.3.1 Afﬁne-Align v.s. RoI-Align

Occluded Cases
In this experiment, we replace the
align module in our framework with RoI-Align based on
groundtruth (Gt) bounding-box, and re-train our model with
nothing else changed. As shown in Table 5, this box-based
alignment strategy can achieve 0.476 AP on OCHuman val-
idation set. Our Afﬁne-Align based on Gt human pose can
achieve 0.544 AP on this same dataset. This means that
even if we do not take into account the NMS’s deﬁcien-
cies on handling occlusion (which is eliminated by using
GT bounding-boxes), the box-based alignment strategy still
does not perform as well as our pose-based alignment strat-
egy in the instance segmentation task of occlusion. The rea-
son is that rotation is allowed in Afﬁne-Align, which helps

to better distinguish two heavy intertwined people by align-
ing into discriminative RoIs. Strong discrimination RoIs are
essential for the segmentation network to locate and extract
the speciﬁc target.

General Cases We also experiment on COCOPerson val-
idation set. If we allow using both Gt bounding-box and
Gt keypoint as input, the best performance is achieved by
combining RoI-Align and our Skeleton features (0.648 AP).
While simultaneously requiring bounding-box and keypoint
as input is a rather strict requirement, and both of them
can introduce error to the framework when using predicted
results instead of ground-truth. If we contraint the frame-
work to only rely on one of them, combining Afﬁne-Align
with Skeleton features can achieved better performance than
using RoI-Align stategy on COCOPerson (0.582 AP v.s.
0.568 AP). What’s more, the upper limits of the box-based
framework is limited by NMS, especially in the case of oc-
clusion. In comparison, our pose-based alignment strategy
has no such limits.

Intuitive Pose-based Alignment An intuitive idea of
pose-based alignment is to ﬁrst generate bounding-boxes
based on human pose key-points, and then use a box-based
alignment strategy, such as RoI-Align, to align each person
into a RoI. We take the maximum and minimum values of

masks for better visualization.

the valid key-points as the generated bounding-box, and ex-
pand the generated bounding-box by a factor α to simulate
the accurate bounding-box as much as possible. We treat
α as a hyperparameter and search for the best value during
testing. Table 5 shows that no matter how this hyperparam-
eter α is adjusted, the performance still cannot match our
Afﬁne-Align strategy.

5.3.2 With/Without Skeleton Features

We also experiment on the contribution of our artiﬁcial
Skeleton features. Table 5 shows that our Skeleton features
are good for different kinds of align strategies because man-
ually concatenating the features of human pose can explic-
itly provide more information for the network, and lead to a
more accurate result. This is more effective for situations
where there is more than one person in the RoIs (which
is very common), because Skeleton features can explicitly
guide the network to focus on the speciﬁc person. Also,
due to this component our framework can better segment
the person under occlusion than the previous methods.

5.3.3 SegModule

We have discussed in Section 4.4 that the receptive ﬁeld is
an important factor to be considered in designing the Seg-
Module. So we experiment how the receptive ﬁeld of Seg-
Module affects our system. We achieve different receptive
ﬁelds by stacking different numbers of residual units after
the ﬁrst convolution. Besides that, all the other components
stay unchanged. As shown in Table 4, our SegModule with
10 residual units can achieve about 50 pixels of receptive
ﬁeld, which is enough for our 64 × 64 alignment size. A
large enough receptive ﬁeld can provide enough learning
ability to understand the image features and artiﬁcial fea-
tures globally. Fewer units will make the network less ca-
pable of learning, and more units have little help with the
learning ability,

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a pose-based human instance
segmentation framework. We designed an Afﬁne-Align

Table 5: Ablation experiments on OCHuman val set and
COCOPerson val set about different alignment strategies
and Skeleton features. All scores are tested using ground-
truth (GT) bounding-box (BBOX) or keypoint (KPT). ‘GT
KPT to BBOX’ represents taking the maximum and mini-
mum values of the valid KPT as the BBOX, and expanding
the BBOX by a factor. Notice that scores marked by * rely
on both BBOX and KPT as input, while others rely on only
one of them.

operation for selecting RoIs based on pose instead of
bounding-boxes. We explicitly concatenate the human pose
skeleton feature to the image feature in the network to fur-
ther improve the performance. Compared with the tradi-
tional detection based instance segmentation framework,
our pose-based system can achieve a better performance in
the general case, and can moreover better handling occlu-
sion. In addition, we introduce a new dataset called OCHu-
man, which focuses on heavily occluded humans, as a chal-
lenging benchmark on occlusion problem.
