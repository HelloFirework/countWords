Abstract

This paper presents a novel framework to recover de-
tailed human body shapes from a single image.
It is a
challenging task due to factors such as variations in hu-
man shapes, body poses, and viewpoints. Prior methods
typically attempt to recover the human body shape using
a parametric based template that lacks the surface de-
tails. As such the resulting body shape appears to be with-
out clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-
based framework that combines the robustness of paramet-
ric model with the ﬂexibility of free-form 3D deformation.
We use the deep neural networks to reﬁne the 3D shape
in a Hierarchical Mesh Deformation (HMD) framework,
utilizing the constraints from body joints, silhouettes, and
per-pixel shading information. We are able to restore de-
tailed human body shapes beyond skinned models. Ex-
periments demonstrate that our method has outperformed
previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving better ac-
curacy in terms of both 2D IoU number and 3D metric dis-
tance. The code is available in https://github.com/

1. Introduction

Recovering 3D human shape from a single image is a
challenging problem and has drawn much attention in re-
cent years. A large number of approaches [8, 5, 6, 31, 17,
32, 23, 16, 21] have been proposed in which the human
body shapes get reconstructed by predicting the parameters
of a statistical body shape model, such as SMPL [20] and
SCAPE [3]. The parametric shape is of low-ﬁdelity, and
unable to capture clothing details. Another collection of
methods[33, 35] estimate volumetric human shape directly
from the image using CNN, while the resulting volumetric
representation is fairly coarse and does not contain shape
details.

Figure 1: Our method (HMD) takes a single 2D im-
age of a person as input and predicts detailed human
body shape. As compared with the current state-of-the-art
method (HMR [16]), we have got the recovered body shapes
with surface details that better ﬁt to the input image.

The limited performance of previous methods is caused
by the large variations of the human shape and pose. Para-
metric or volumetric shapes are not expressive enough to
represent the inherent complexity.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to recon-
struct detailed human shape from a single image. The key
here is to combine the robustness of parametric model with
the ﬂexibility of free-form deformation. In short, we build
on top of current SMPL model to obtain an initial paramet-
ric mesh model and perform non-rigid 3D deformation on
the mesh to reﬁne the surface shape. We design a coarse-
to-ﬁne reﬁnement scheme in which a deep neural network

14491

is used in each stage to estimate the 3D mesh vertex move-
ment by minimizing its 2D projection error in the image
space. We feed window-cropped images instead of full im-
age to the network, which leads to more accurate and ro-
bust prediction of deformation. In addition, we integrate a
photometric term to allow high-frequency details to be re-
covered. These techniques combined lead to a method that
signiﬁcantly improves, both visually and quantitatively, the
recovered human shape from a single image as shown in
Figure 1.

The contributions of this paper include:
• We develop a novel project - predict - deform strategy
to predict the deformation of the 3D mesh model by
using 2D features.

• We carefully design a hierarchical update structure, in-
corporating body joints, silhouettes, and photometric-
stereo to improve shape accuracy without losing the
robustness.

• We are the ﬁrst to use a single image to recover detailed
human shape beyond parameters human model. As
demonstrated throughout our experiments, the addi-
tional free deformation of the initial parametric model
leads to quantitatively more accurate shapes with good
generalization capabilities to images in the wild.

2. Related Work

Previous approaches can be divided into two categories
based on the way the human body is represented: paramet-
ric methods and non-parametric methods.

As for parametric methods, they rely on a pre-trained
generative human model, such as the SCAPE [3] or
SMPL [20] models. The goal is to predict the parameters of
the generative model. The SCAPE model has been adopted
by Guan et al. [8] to recover the human shape and poses
from the monocular image as provided with some manu-
ally clicked key points and the constraint of smooth shad-
ing. Instead of relying on manual intervention, Dibra et al.
[6] have trained a convolutional neural network to predict
SCAPE parameters from a single silhouette. Similar to the
SCAPE model, Hasler et al. [11] have proposed a multi-
linear model of human pose and body shape that is gen-
erated by factorizing the measurements into the pose and
shape dependent components. The SMPL model [20] has
recently drawn much attention due to its ﬂexibility and ef-
ﬁciency. For example, Bogo et al. [5] have presented an
automatic approach called SMPLify which ﬁts the SMPL
model by minimizing an objective function that penalizes
the error between the projected model joints and detected
2D joints obtained from a CNN-based method together with
some priors over the pose and shape. Building upon this
SMPLify method, Lassner et al. [17] have formed an initial
dataset of 3D body ﬁtting with rich annotations consisting

of 91 keypoints and 31 segments. Using this dataset, they
have shown improved performance on part segmentation,
pose estimation and 3D ﬁtting. Tan et al. [31] proposed
an indirect learning procedure by ﬁrst training a decoder to
predict body silhouettes from SMPL parameters and then
using pairs of real images and ground truth silhouettes to
train a full encoder-decoder network to predict SMPL pa-
rameters at the information bottleneck. Pavlakos et al. [23]
separated the SMPL parameters prediction network into two
sub-networks. Taking the 2D image as input, the ﬁrst net-
work was designed to predict the silhouette and 2D joints,
from which the shape and pose parameters were estimated
respectively. The latter network combined the shape and
2D joints to predict the ﬁnal mesh. Kanazawa et al. [16]
proposed an end-to-end framework to recover the human
body shape and pose in the form of SMPL model using only
2D joints annotations with an adversarial loss to effectively
constrain the pose.
Instead of using joints or silhouettes.
Omran et al. [21] believed that a reliable bottom-up seman-
tic body part segmentation was more effective for shape and
pose prediction. Therefore, they predicted a part segmen-
tation from the input image in the ﬁrst stage and took this
segmentation to predict SMPL parameterization of the body
mesh.

Non-parametric methods directly predict the shape rep-
resentation from the image. Some researchers have used
depth maps as a more general and direct representation for
shapes. For example, Varol et al. [34] trained a convolu-
tional neural network by building up a synthetic dataset of
rendered SMPL models to predict the human shape in the
form of depth image and body part segmentation. G¨uler et
al. [10, 9] have treated the shape prediction problem as a
correspondence regression problem, which would produce
a dense 2D-to-3D surface correspondence ﬁeld for the hu-
man body. Another way of representing 3D shapes is to
embed the 3D mesh into a volumetric space [33, 35]. For
example, Varol et al. [33] restored volumetric body shape
directly from a single image. Their method focuses more
on robust body measurements rather than shape details or
poses.

While signiﬁcant progress has been made in this very
difﬁcult problem, the resulting human shape is still lack-
ing in accuracy and details, visually they all look like un-
dressed.

3. Hierarchical Deformation Framework

We present our hierarchical deformation framework to
recover detailed human body shapes by reﬁning a template
model in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. As shown in Figure 2,
there are four stages in our framework: First, an initial
SMPL mesh is estimated from the source image. Starting
from this, the next three stages serve as reﬁnement phases
which predict the deformation of the mesh so as to pro-

Vertex-level Deform

Figure 2: The ﬂow of our method goes from the bottom left to the top right. The mesh deformation architecture consists
of three levels: joint, anchor and per-vertex. In each level, the 3D mesh is projected to 2D space and sent together with the
source image to the prediction network. The 3D mesh gets deformed by the predicted results to produce reﬁned human body
shapes.

duce a detailed human shape. We have used the HMR
method [16] to predict the initial human mesh model, which
has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on human
shape recovery from a single image. However, like other
human shape recovery methods [23, 21, 5] that utilize the
SMPL model, the HMR method predicts the shape and pose
parameters to generate a skinned mesh model with limited
ﬂexibility to closely ﬁt the input image or express surface
details. For example, the HMR often predicts deﬂected joint
position of limbs when the human pose is unusual. There-
fore, we have designed our framework to reﬁne both the
shape and the pose.

The reﬁning stages are arranged hierarchically from
coarse to ﬁne. We deﬁne three levels of key points on the
mesh, referred to as handles in this paper. We will describe
exactly how we deﬁne these handles in the next section. In
each level, we design a deep neural network to reﬁne the
3D mesh geometry using these handles as control points.
We train the three reﬁnement networks separately and suc-
cessively to predict the residual deformation based on its
previous phase.

To realize the overall reﬁnement procedure, a challeng-
ing problem is how to deform the 3D human mesh from
handles in 2D space using deep neural networks. We ad-
dress this using Laplacian mesh deformation. In detail, the
motion vector for each handle is predicted from the net-
work driven by the joints and silhouettes of the 2D image.
Then the human mesh will get deformed with the Laplacian
deformation approach given the movements of the handles
while maintaining the local geometry as much as possible.
The deforming strategy has been used in multi-view shape

reconstruction problem [1, 38, 18, 24, 39, 26, 27], while we
are the ﬁrst to predict the deformation from a single image
with the deep neural network.

3.1. Handle Deﬁnitions

In this section, we will describe the handles that we have
used in each level. They could be predeﬁned in the tem-
plate model thanks to the uniform topology of SMPL mesh
model.

Joint handles. We select 10 joints as the control points –
head, waist, left/right shoulders, left/right elbows, left/right
knees, and left/right ankles. The vertices around the joints
under the T-pose SMPL mesh are selected as handles, as
shown in Figure 3. We take the geometric center of each set
of handles as the position of its corresponding body joint.
The motion of each joint handle is represented as a 2D vec-
tor, which refers to the vector from the joint position of
projected mesh to ground truth joint position on the image
plane.

Anchor handles. We select 200 vertices on the human
template mesh under T-pose as anchor handles. To select
the anchors evenly over the template, we ﬁrstly build a vec-
tor set C = {v1, v2, ......, vn} with vi concatenated by the
position and surface normal of the vertex i and n is the num-
ber of SMPL model vertices. Then K-means is applied to
cluster set C into 200 classes. Finally, we set the closest
vertex to the center of each cluster as the anchor handles.
Besides, we have removed the vertices in the face, ﬁngers,
toes from the T-pose SMPL model to prevent the interfer-
ence of high-frequency shape. To be noticed that, for each
anchor, it is only allowed to move along the surface normal

direction, so we just need to predict a single value indicating
the movement of the anchor point along the normal direc-
tion.

Vertex-level handles. The vertices in the SMPL mesh
are too sparse to apply pixel-level deform, so we subdi-
vide each face of the mesh into 4 faces. The subdivision
increases the number of vertices of the template mesh to
27554, and all these vertices are regarded as handles.

3.2. Joint and Anchor Prediction

Network. Both joint and anchor prediction networks use
the VGG [30] structure which consists of a feature extractor
and a regressor. The network takes the mesh-projected sil-
houette and source image as input, which are cropped into
patches as centered with our predeﬁned handles. Speciﬁ-
cally, for a 224 × 224 input image, the image is cropped
into patches with the size of 64 × 64 for joint prediction,
and 32 × 32 for anchor prediction. Comparing to the full
image or silhouette as input, the handle cropped input al-
lows the network to focus on the region of interest. We will
demonstrate the effectiveness of the cropped input in Sec-
tion 4.3.

Loss. The output of the joint net is 2D vector represent-
ing the joint motion in the image plane. L2 loss is exploited
to train the joint net with the loss function formulated as:

Ljoint = ||p − (cid:2)p||2

(1)

where p is the predicted motion vector from the network

and (cid:2)p is the displacement vector from the mesh-projected

joint position to its corresponding ground truth joint. Both
vectors are 2-dimensional.

As for the anchor net, our immediate goal is to minimize
the area of the mismatched part between the projected sil-
houette and the ground truth silhouette. However, as it is
hard to compute the derivatives of area size with respect to
the motion vector for back-propagation in the training pro-
cess, we transform the mismatched area size to the length
of the projected line segment along vertex normal direction
which falls into the mismatched region. The searching ra-
dius of the segment line is 0.1m. The length of this line seg-
ment is regarded as the ground truth anchor movement, and
L2 loss is used to train the network. This conversion makes
it easy to calculate the gradient for the loss function. If the
ground truth movement of one anchor handle is zero, this

handle would be disabled, which means the anchor would
be regarded as common vertices in the Laplacian edit. We
compulsively set the anchors which are far from the silhou-
ette margin to be inactive, and the overall shape would be
deformed equably since the Laplacian deforming will keep
the local geometry as much as possible.

Besides, instead of using the RGB image as input, the
joint and anchor prediction network could also take ground
truth silhouette of the human ﬁgure as input if available.
The silhouette provides more explicit information for the
human ﬁgure, which prevents the network from getting con-
fused by the cluttered background environment. We will
demonstrate its effectiveness on joint and anchor deforma-
tion prediction in the experiment section. In this paper, we
consider the RGB-only as input by default, and use ‘+Sil.’
to indicate the case where the additional silhouette is used.

3.3. Vertex-level Deformation

To add high-frequency details to the reconstructed hu-
man models, we exploit the shading information contained
in the input image. First, we project the current 3D human
model into the image space, from which we will get the
coarse depth map. We then train a Shading-Net that takes
the color image and current depth map as input and predicts
a reﬁned depth map with surface details. We have built
up a relatively small dataset which contains color images,
over-smoothed depth maps, and corresponding ground truth
depth maps that have good surface details. More detailed
explanations on this dataset could be found in Section 3.4.
We adopt a multi-stage training scheme with limited super-
vised data.

Following the training scheme proposed in [29], we
ﬁrstly train a simple UNet based encoder-decoder net-
work [28] on our captured depth dataset taking the over-
smoothed depth map and its corresponding color image as
input. The network is trained as supervised by the ground
truth depth maps. Next, we apply this network on the real
images of our human body dataset to obtain enhanced depth
maps. As we only have limited supervised data, the network
may not generalize well to our real images. Therefore, to ﬁ-
nally get depth maps with great surface details consistent
with the color images, we train our Shading-Net, which is
also a U-Net based network on real images. The network is
trained with both the supervision loss using the depth maps
output by the ﬁrst U-Net and also a photometric reconstruc-
tion loss [36] that aims to minimize the error between the
original input image and the reconstructed image. The per-
pixel photometric loss Lphoto is formulated as below:

Lphoto = ||ρ

lkHk(n) − I||2

where ρ is the albedo computed by a traditional intrin-
sic decomposition method [4]. Similar to [25, 42], we use

resentation under the Lambertian surface assumption. Hk

We use the coarse depth map rendered from the currently

3.4. Implementation Details

We use the pre-trained model in the HMR-net, then train
Joint-Net, Anchor-Net, and Shading-Net successively. We
use the ‘Adam’ optimizer to train these networks, with the
learning rate as 0.0001. The handle weight in Laplacian edit
is 10 for joint deforming and is 1 for anchor deforming.

To provide better training data to the Shading-Net, we
have captured a small depth dataset with a Kinect V2 sensor.
It consists of 2200 depth frames with three human subjects
wearing different clothes under various poses. The captured
depth maps are further enhanced using traditional shading
reﬁnement techniques [22, 41] to recover small surface de-
tails, which can be taken as ground truth depth maps for
supervised learning. We have magniﬁed the shape details
by 10 times during the test time.

4. Experiment

4.1. Datasets

We have assembled three datasets for the experiment:
the WILD dataset which has a large number of images with
sparse 2D joints and segmentation annotated, and two other
small datasets for evaluation in 3D metrics.

WILD Dataset. We assemble a quite large dataset
for training and testing by extracting from 5 human
datasets including MPII human pose database (MPII) [2],
Common Objects in Context dataset (COCO) [19], Hu-
man3.6M dataset (H36M) [13, 12], Leeds Sports Pose
dataset (LSP) [14] and its extension dataset (LSPET) [15].
As most of the images are captured in an uncontrolled setup,
we call it the WILD dataset. The Unite the People (UP)
dataset [17] provides ground truth silhouettes for the im-
ages in LSP, LSPET, and MPII datasets. As we focus on
human shape recovery of the whole body, images with par-
tial human bodies are removed based on the following two
rules:

• All joints exist in the images.

• All joints are inside the body silhouette.

For COCO and H36M dataset, we further ﬁlter out the
data with low-quality silhouettes. We separate the training

and testing data according to the rules of each dataset. The
numbers of the data we use are listed in Table 2.

The main drawback of WILD dataset is the lack of 3D
ground truth shape. Though the UP dataset provides the
ﬁtted SMPL mesh for some data, the accuracy is uncertain.
To help evaluate the 3D accuracy, we make two other small
datasets with ground truth shape:

RECON Dataset We reconstruct 25 human mesh mod-
els using the traditional multi-view 3D reconstruction meth-
ods [7]. We render each model to 6 views and the views are
randomly selected from 54 candidate views, of which the
azimuth ranges from 0◦ to 340◦ with intervals 20◦, and the
elevation ranges from −10◦ to +10◦ with intervals of 10◦.
We use various scene images from the Places dataset[37] as
background.

SYN Dataset We render 300 synthetic human mesh
models in PVHM dataset [40] following their rendering
setup, with the random scene images from Places dataset
as background. The meshes of PVHM include the inner
surface, which is a disturbance for surface accuracy estima-
tion. To ﬁlter out the inner surface, we project the mesh to
6 orthogonal directions and remove the faces which are not
seen in all 6 directions.

For RECON dataset and SYN dataset, the reconstructed
3D meshes are scaled so that the mean height of the human
body are close to the general body height of the common
adult. In this way, we could measure the 3D error in mm.

4.2. Accuracy Evaluations

We measure the accuracy of the recovered shape with
several metrics (corresponding to the second row in Ta-
ble 1). For all test sets, we report the silhouette Intersection
over Union (sil IoU), which measures the matching rate of
the projected silhouette of the predicted 3D shape and the
image silhouette. For the WILD dataset, we measure the
difference between the projected 2D joints of the predicted
3D shape and the annotated ground truth joints. The joints
of the mesh are extracted by computing the geometric cen-
ter of the corresponding joint handle vertices. For the RE-
CON dataset and SYN dataset, we also report the 3D error
(3D err), which is the average distance of vertices between
the predicted mesh and the ground truth mesh. We ﬁnd the
closest vertices in the resulting mesh for each vertex in the
ground truth mesh and compute the mean of their distances
as the 3D error.

4.3. Staging Analysis

We show the staging results in Figure 4 (right four
columns) and report the quantitative evaluation of each
stage in Table 1. The results in different phases are named
as HMD-joint, HMD-anchor, and HMD-vertex (ﬁnal re-
sult). We can see that the shape has got reﬁned stage by
stage. In the joint deformation phase, the joint correction

Figure 4: We compare our method with previous approaches. The results of our method in different stages are shown: joint
deformed, anchor deformed and vertex deformed (ﬁnal result). Comparing to other methods, our method recovers more
accurate joints and the body with shape details. The human body shape ﬁts better to the input image, especially in body
limbs. The rightmost column shows we can get more accurate recovered shapes when ground truth human silhouette is
enforced (labeled as HMD (+Sil.)). Note that the images are cropped for the compact layout.

Figure 5: The results selected based on the rank of silhouette IoU. We could see in columns of the left side, the person with
a simple pose like standing yields really good ﬁt. As we go from left to right columns, sports in the images are getting more
complicated and the corresponding human shape is harder to predict. And in the right side columns, our method fails to
predict humans with accessories (helmet, gloves) and under extremely twisting poses.

takes effects to correct the displacement of joints. In the an-
chor deformation phase, silhouette supervision plays a key
role in ﬁtting the human shape. In the vertex deformation
stage, the shape details are recovered to produce a visually
plausible result.

Ablation study. We report the result of the ablation ex-
periment in Table 3, where (w) means the window-cropped
input, and (f) means the full image input. We demonstrate
two following statements:
(1) By comparing the perfor-
mance between full image input (No. 3 and 5) and window-
crop image input (No. 3 and 5) in the table, we could see
that the window-crop input predicts much higher silhouette
IoU and lower joint error comparing to full image input,
while the model size of the window-crop network is only
41% of the full image network. The reason why it has got
better result is that the window-crop network inherently fo-
cuses on the handle as the input center, so the problem turns
to predicting the local ﬁt for each handle, which is easier to
learn. (2) By comparing the performance between the in-
tegration of ‘joint + anchor’ deformation (No. 6) and only
anchor or joint deformation (No. 3 and 5), we ﬁnd that
the combination achieves the best performance, and shows
larger improvement than the pure anchor deformation.

Prediction with silhouette. Our method takes the RGB
image as input by default, while we could also take addi-
tional silhouettes as input. They can share the same frame-
work and the difference is explained in Section 3.2. We
show the qualitative comparison result in the last column in
Figure 4 and the quantitative result in the last three rows in
Table 1. As expected, the prediction with silhouette pro-
duces better results in all metrics.

4.4. Comparison with Other Methods

We compare our method with other methods with qual-
itative results shown in Figure 4 and quantitative results in
Table 1. We use the trained model of BodyNet and HMR
provided by the authors. As BodyNet requires 3D shape
for training, they don’t use COCO and H36M datasets. To
be fair, the evaluation on the WILD datasets only uses the
data from LSP, LSPET, and MPII, which are the intersec-
tion of datasets used in all estimated methods. Compar-
ing to SMPL based methods (SMPLIify and HMR), our
method has got the best performance in all metrics on all
three datasets. As compared with BodyNet, a volumetric
based prediction method, we have got comparable scores in
3D error on RECON dataset. The reason is that the Bo-

* ‘full’ means the full body shape is used for error estimation, and ‘vis’ means only the visible part with respect to the input image
viewpoint is used for error estimation.
The statistic unit of 3D error is millimeter; the 2D joint error is measured by pixel. The methods beyond the cutting line use only RGB
image as input, while the methods under the cutting line use ‘RGB + silhouette’ as input. Some statistic is blank: the joint position
cannot be derived directly from the mesh produced by BodyNet; The sil IoU and 2D joint error after vertex deformation stay the same
as anchor deformed results.

even though they could ﬁt closely to the input image. The
estimated depth cue from a single image is sometimes am-
biguous for shape recovery. This observation explains the
reason why the improvement of our method in 2D metrics
is relatively larger than the improvement in 3D metrics.

dyNet produces more conservative shapes instead of focus-
ing on the recovery of a complete human model. In some
cases, the body limbs have not got reconstructed by the Bo-
dyNet when they are not visible from the image, while we
always have the complete body recovered even though some
parts of limbs haven’t appeared in the image. This makes it
easy to have a better registration to the ground truth mesh
resulting in smaller 3D error. However, their scores on
SYN datasets are lower than the other two datasets, since
the human subjects from the SYN dataset generally have
slim body shapes in which case the BodyNet results are de-
graded.

4.5. 3D Error Analysis

Figure 6 shows our recovered 3D model on the RECON
and SYN datasets together with the ground truth mesh. We
show that the inherent pose and shape ambiguities cannot
be resolved with the image from a single viewpoint. As
we can see in Figure 6, the human shapes seen from the
side view are quite different from the ground truth model

We show some view synthesis results by mapping the
texture in the image to the recovered mesh model in Figure
7. From the side view, we can see that our method yields
better textured model as the mesh matches the image well.
By diluting the foreground region to the background (HMD-
r), the texture in the margin parts are further improved.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to re-
construct detailed human body shapes from a single image
in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. Starting from an SMPL model
based human recovery method, we introduce free-form de-
formations to reﬁne the body shapes with a project-predict-
deform strategy. A hierarchical framework has been pro-
posed for restoring more accurate and detailed human bod-
ies under the supervision of joints, silhouettes, and shad-
ing information. We have performed extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrated signiﬁcant
improvements in both quantitative and qualitative assess-
ments.

The limitation of our work is that the pose ambiguities
are not solved, and there are still large errors in predicted
body meshes especially in depth direction.
