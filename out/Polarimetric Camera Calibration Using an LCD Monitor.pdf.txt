Abstract

It is crucial for polarimetric imaging to accurately cali-
brate the polarizer angles and the camera response function
(CRF) of a polarizing camera. When this polarizing camera
is used in a setting of multiview geometric imaging, it is
often required to calibrate its intrinsic and extrinsic param-
eters as well, for which Zhang’s calibration method is the
most widely used with either a physical checker board, or
more conveniently a virtual checker pattern displayed on a
monitor. In this paper, we propose to jointly calibrate the
polarizer angles and the inverse CRF (ICRF) using a slightly
adapted checker pattern displayed on a liquid crystal display
(LCD) monitor. Thanks to the lighting principles and the
industry standards of the LCD monitors, the polarimetric
and radiometric calibration can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed,
when assisted by the extrinsic parameters estimated from the
checker pattern. We present a simple linear method for polar-
izer angle calibration and a convex method for radiometric
calibration, both of which can be jointly reﬁned in a process
similar to bundle adjustment. Experiments have veriﬁed the
feasibility and accuracy of the proposed calibration method.

1. Introduction

Polarization of a beam of light reﬂected from a surface
conveys information about the azimuth and zenith angles,
which can be used to determine the surface normal [8]. Sur-
face reconstruction based on this principle is known as shape
from polarization (SfP) [31, 25, 27, 6, 33, 41]. Compared
to multi-view stereo methods, SfP has the advantage of in-
dependence from discriminative surface texture, and can
be extended to reconstruct transparent objects [31, 25] or
challenging dielectric objects [27, 6]. To capture polari-
metric information, one can use a commodity polarizing
camera [1, 2, 3], or conveniently construct a prototype by
attaching a linear polarizer onto an ordinary camera, like a
DLSR camera or an embedded camera in the mobile device.

tion, it is required to calibrate the camera response function
(CRF) and the rotation angles of the polarizer. To control
the exposure allows to calibrate the CRF, or equivalently the
inverse CRF (ICRF), and to use a mechanical rotator can
determine the polarizer angles, both of which are not always
accessible. On the contrary, image-based self-calibration
methods are more convenient in use, yet they usually suffer
from issues in applicability and reliability. For example,
the state-of-the-art self-calibration methods [32, 36] can es-
timate polarizer angles of a camera with linear/nonlinear
response respectively. However, these methods require four
and more polarizer angles, and thus do not work for polar-
izing cameras with no more than three polarizing channels,
such as the FluxData camera [2]. As for reliability, their
alternating optimization scheme depends on a good angle
initialization for convergence, which is not always available.
Also, when the CRF is nonlinear, the estimated angles will
be severely distorted, unless an additional radiometric cal-
ibration method [35, 11, 28] is used beforehand to correct
the image intensity. Therefore, a general, reliable and conve-
nient method for radiometric and polarimetric calibration is
needed.

Recently, polarization has been combined with other
imaging modalities, such as depth sensors [15], binocular
stereo [7] and multiview stereo [26, 9], because of their
complementary characteristics. It requires to calibrate the
camera’s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters as well. Zhang’s
calibration method [43] is arguably the most widely used for
this purpose, because of its proper tradeoff between the cali-
bration accuracy and the difﬁculty in making a calibration
target. Rather than using a physical checker board, some
researches [14, 42, 34, 19] proposed to use a virtual checker
pattern on a monitor, not only because of the easy availabil-
ity of monitors, but also the augmented performance arising
from monitor’s properties. Given the popularity of geometric
camera calibration using a checker pattern displayed on a
monitor, a radiometric and polarimetric calibration method
using similar calibration setup for a polarizing camera is
likely to be widely used in practice.

In this paper, we ﬁrst propose to calibrate the polarizer an-
gles using the standard checker pattern displayed on a liquid
crystal display (LCD) monitor. When the CRF is unknown,

we jointly calibrate the ICRF and the polarizer angles using
a slightly adapted checker pattern. Compared with existing
self-calibration methods [32, 36], our method is greatly sim-
pliﬁed, thanks to the extrinsic parameters obtained from the
checker pattern, and to the lighting mechanisms and the in-
dustry standards of LCDs. Speciﬁcally, the relative in-plane
rotation between the camera polarizer and the front polar-
izer of the monitor can be directly obtained by factorizing
the extrinsic parameters of the checker pattern. In addition,
the transmitted light from an LCD monitor is completely
polarized, and an LCD monitor usually has a gamma of 2.2
under various display modes. The facts that transmitted light
from an LCD monitor is highly polarized and the phase shift
can be determined by extrinsic geometric parameter decom-
position lead to a simple linear calibration method for the
polarizer angles, which is applicable to cameras with two or
more polarizing channels, less than four or more channels
required in [32, 36]. The prior information on the LCD mon-
itor gamma allows us to produce linear radiance by adapting
the checker pattern, and the ICRF estimation boils down to
a constrained parametric ﬁtting problem, which is a convex
quadratic program (QP).

Similar to bundle adjustment (BA) in geometric calibra-
tion, we jointly polish the ICRF and the polarizer angle
estimation to account for imperfections in LCD gamma com-
pensation. Experimental results have demonstrated the ac-
curacy of our calibration method. Considering that LCD
monitors are everywhere, we believe that our method is as
easy to use as self-calibration methods, yet it is superior in
application scope and reliability. In particular, it is suited
for multi-view/multi-modality polarimetric imaging, as a
by-product of geometric camera calibration.

2. Related Work

Polarization imaging. The polarization state of reﬂected
light from a surface illuminated by unpolarized light encodes
the surface normal information, which can be used to recover
the surface geometry. This property has aroused intensive
research efforts in shape from polarization [31, 25, 27, 6, 33,
41]. To correctly estimate the phase angle and the polariza-
tion status of the surface point, it is necessary to calibrate
the ICRF and the polarizer angles of the camera.

Considering that polarization imaging has less restric-
tions on the illumination distribution and the surface re-
ﬂectance properties, it has recently been used in conjunction
with depth sensors [15], binocular stereo [7] and multiview
stereo [26, 9]. SfP beneﬁts from these modalities to resolve
the ambiguity in azimuth angle estimation. In turn, polar-
ization provides dense normal information that can be used
to improve surface estimation, even with sparsely located
texture. In addition to radiometric and polarimetric calibra-
tion, to merge polarization into other modalities requires to
calibrate the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

Polarizer angle calibration. An ideal method for polar-
izer angle calibration is to use a mechanical rotator. How-
ever, most people do not possess such a specialized device.
Schechner [32] proposed a self-calibration method, which
applies only to a polarizing camera with four and more po-
larizing channels. The iterative algorithm is sensitive to
initialization. It also assumes that the camera response is
linear. When the camera indeed has nonlinear response, a
third-party radiometric calibration method has to be used
before conducting angle calibration. Teo et al. [36] proposed
to estimate the nonlinear CRF and polarizer angles simul-
taneously. But the involvement of CRF estimation makes
polarizer angle calibration less accurate. Besides, it requires
more polarizer angles and is more sensitive to initialization.
Radiometric calibration. Radiometric calibration has been
studied extensively in photometric computer vision, where
the mapping between the irradiance and the recorded in-
tensity is important. The response can be calibrated by
controlling exposures [10, 24]. When there is no access to
exposure control, the standard color chart with predeﬁned
reﬂectance values can be used [23]. Rather than using a
calibration target, image-based radiometric calibration meth-
ods achieves the goal by using multiple images [35, 11, 28]
or even a single image, and analyzing the RGB distribu-
tions at color edges [18], symmetric distribution of camera
noise [21], geometry invariants [29] and the color properties
of skin pigments [17].
Geometric calibration. To estimate the intrinsic and ex-
trinsic parameters of a pinhole camera is indispensable in
geometric computer vision. It has been achieved by using
a variety of specialized calibration targets [37, 40, 43, 44]
or using image information only [22, 20, 30]. Zhang’s cal-
ibration method [43] is widely used in practice, because it
is accurate and only requires a planar checker board. In
contrast to the last generation CRT monitors, modern LCD
monitors are planar. Therefore, geometric calibration using
a virtual pattern [14, 42, 34, 19] is advocated, which is more
convenient than making a physical checker board.
Miscellaneous applications of monitors.
In addition to
the use in geometric calibration, monitors have been used in
radiometric calibration [39] with temporal irradiance mixture
(Note that the LCD gamma characteristic is not utilized
there). Multi-layer LCDs have been used for light ﬁeld
displays [16]. In addition, LCD monitors can be used as an
ideal polarizing light source [38], because of their lighting
characteristics that will be detailed in the following section.

3. Characteristics of LCD Monitors

3.1. Typical Structure of LCDs

LCD monitors are the dominant display device nowadays.
The typical interior structure is illustrated in Figure 1(a). A
beam of unpolarized light emits from the backboard. It goes

through the ﬁrst (back) linear polarizer, the liquid crystal
phase retarder, and the second (front) linear polarizer, whose
polarizing direction is perpendicular to that of the back po-
larizer. The intensity of the transmitted light is manipulated
by adjusting the polarizing direction of light passing through
the liquid crystal. Note that the polarization direction of the
transmitted beam to the air is constant. Its intensity obeys
the Malus’ law

I = Io cos2(θ),

(1)

where θ is the rotation angle between the polarizing direc-
tion of the light passing through the liquid crystal and the
transmission axis of the front polarizer; Io is the intensity of
the light from the back polarizer. When there is no voltage
added to the liquid crystal layer, the rotation angle θ equals
π/2, and the beam of polarized light cannot pass through
the second polarizer. Otherwise, when the angle θ decreases
from π/2 to 0 with increasing voltages, the intensity I will
change from 0 to Io.

3.2. LCD Monitors Viewed by a Polarizing Camera

The irradiance of a sequence of images captured by a
camera with a linear polarizer rotating in front of an LCD
monitor will oscillate sinusoidally between the maximum
irradiance Imax and the minimum irradiance Imin, as a func-
tion of the camera polarizer angle φ, whose function value
depends on the angle difference between φ and the phase
angle ψ of the front polarizer in the monitor (Figure 1(b)),

I(φ) =

Imax + Imin

+

Imax − Imin

cos [2(φ − ψ)] . (2)

Note that, Equation (2) looks the same as the reﬂective polar-
ization imaging equation [15, 26, 9], which has been widely
used in shape from polarization. The phase angle ψ relates
to the azimuth angle of the surface normal (with some am-
biguities), and the degree of polarization Imax−Imin
links to
Imax+Imin
the zenith angle via the refractive index.

In our setting, there are two important characteristics that
will be very helpful for camera polarizer angle calibration.
First, the phase angle is related to the in-plane rotation be-
tween the camera polarizer and the monitor front polarizer.

Figure 2. Illustration of transmitted radiance sinusoid (TRS) phase
shift w.r.t. rotation angle ϑi.

Figure 2 shows how I(φ) changes when varying the rota-
tion angles ϑ1, ϑ2 and ϑ3 of the monitor along three axes
respectively. It is clear that ϑ1 or ϑ2 is irrelevant to the phase
shift in I(φ). In contrast, the monitor’s in-plane rotation
angle ϑ3 plays an important role as the change in the phase
angle clearly depends on ϑ3. Therefore, we only need to
estimate the monitor’s in-plane rotation angle, and it is safe
to ignore the other two rotations. Since the checker pattern
is displayed on the monitor, the in-plane rotation between
monitor (front polarizer of the monitor) and the polarizer in
the camera can be easily determined by decomposing the
extrinsic parameters obtained from the camera geometric
intrinsic parameter and the checker pattern image. Second,
the transmitted light from a modern LCD monitor is always
completely polarized, so as to increase the dynamic range of
the monitor, a crucial index when manufacturing LCDs. It
implies that Imin should be close to 0 for any valid polarizer
in the camera. We experimentally veriﬁed it by viewing three
commodity LCD monitors at different poses using a camera
with a rotating polarizer. As shown in Figure 3(a), for all
conﬁgurations of monitors and poses, the ratio Imin/Imax
is less than 0.001. This property will contribute to a linear
calibration method of the camera polarizer angle later.

3.3. Gamma Characteristic of LCD Monitors

Most monitors use the sRGB color space mode in default.
According to the IEC standards [5], the mapping between
the irradiance I and the observation I t of the sRGB color
space can be approximated by a gamma curve of γ = 2.2.
LCD monitors usually allow to change the display mode
from sRGB to others, like movie and paper. We experimen-
tally examined this using the three LCDs mentioned above,
and our observation is shown in Figure 3(b). We can see
that the monitor gamma keeps almost constant, although
there are small deviations according to the monitor maker
and the display mode. This characteristic will be used to
obtain an initial estimate of the ICRF, and the effect of the
aforementioned deviations will be largely eliminated by our
bundle adjustment like operation.

4. The Proposed Method

Overview. By leveraging the characteristics of LCD moni-
tors, our complete framework for joint radiometric and po-
larimetric calibration along with geometric calibration is
shown in Figure 4, which consists of the following steps:

a) Take several images of the adapted checker pattern
on an LCD monitor from various viewpoints using a
polarizing camera;

b) Calibrate the camera geometric parameters using [43];

c) Estimate the ICRF through a convex QP;

When ICRF is known, steps c) and e) are unnecessary and
the method only performs polarimetric calibration. In this
special case, we can also use the standard checker pattern.

4.1. Known Inverse CRF

As mentioned in Section 3, the phase angle ψ is related
to camera in-plane rotation angle directly, we can just use
the yaw angle decomposed from the rotation matrix R as
the estimation of the phase angle ˆψ. Given the ICRF ˆg, and
the estimated phase angle ˆψ, we propose a linear solution
for estimating polarizer angles. By plugging the measured
intensity values Mk,p and ˆg into Equation (2), the relation-
ship between the measured intensity and the polarizer angle
is given by

ˆg(Mk,p) = tp + ap cos 2(φk − ˆψp) ,

(3)

where tp = (Imax(p) + Imin(p))/2, ap = (Imax(p) −
Imin(p))/2 and Mk,p is the measured intensity of the pixel
p for the k-th polarizer angle φk. Recall that the transmitted
light from an LCD monitor is completely polarized and Imin
should approach 0, implying ap ≈ tp. Equation (3) can be
further expressed as

ˆg(Mk,p) = tp (1+αp cos 2φk +βp sin 2φk) ,

(4)

in which cos 2φk, sin 2φk, tp are unknown variables and
αp = cos 2 ˆψp, βp = sin 2 ˆψp are known values and ˆψp is the
phase angle of the monitor when the pixel p is measured.

Equation (4) leads to a bilinear equation, which is hard to
handle in general. Fortunately, tp is shared for all polarizer
angles and can be eliminated by dividing with the equation
corresponding to the ﬁrst polarizer angle:

ˆg(Mk,p)
ˆg(M1,p)

=

1 + αp cos 2φk + βp sin 2φk
1 + αp cos 2φ1 + βp sin 2φ1

,

(5)

for k = 2, . . . , K and p = 1, . . . , P , where K and P represent
the number of polarizer angles and that of pixels, respectively.
Note that it assumes ˆg(M1,p) 6= 0, i.e., tp 6= 0 and it implies
φ1 6= ˆψp ±π/2.

By cross multiplication, Equation (5) becomes a linear

equation, which can be stacked into a matrix form

The ﬂowchart of the proposed method. By taking a few images of the gamma compensated checker pattern displayed on an LCD
screen, we use Zhang’s method for geometric calibration. The ICRF is calibrated using patches with linear radiance. Using the corrected
proﬁles, the camera polarizer angles are calibrated by solving a linear system with the assistance of extrinsic pose decomposition. A bundle
adjustment like procedure is used to further reﬁne the estimated ICRF and polarizer angles jointly.

The submatrix pm can be constructed by

pm = (cid:20)α1 ˆIm,1 α2 ˆIm,2

(7)

and ˆIm,p = ˆg(Mm,p) for m = 1, . . . , K. Hence, we can solve
the linear system easily as

˜P = (cid:16) ˜OT ˜O(cid:17)−1

˜OT ˜D ,

(8)

from which the polarizer angles φk can be obtained. This
linear method to calibrate the angles is one of the key fea-
tures of the proposed method, since it does not require any
iteration and initialization.

According to Equation (4), the number of constraints is
KP , which should be no less than the number of variables
K +P , i.e., KP ≥ K +P . This gives the minimal require-
ments for our calibration method. Speciﬁcally, we need that
K ≥ 2 and P ≥ 2, that is, our method applies to a polarizing
camera with two or more polarizing channels. Considering
that all pixels of the screen have the same phase shift, P ≥ 2
implies that the LCD monitor (or the camera) should rotate at
least once in the polarizer plane. In other words, our method
is degenerate if no in-plane rotation happens in all poses.
Note that this case is not degenerate for Zhang’s geometric
calibration method. However, we believe this requirement
imposes little restriction in practice.

4.2. Unknown Inverse CRF

Calibration pattern. When the ICRF is unknown, we cali-
brate it by leveraging the characteristics of LCD monitors.

Figure 5. Calibration patterns.

We designed three patterns (Figure 5): P1, which is more
similar to the standard checker; P2, which consists of a
sequence of dithered B/W patterns; and P3, our adapted
checker pattern. P3 is based on a 7× 9 checkerboard and
each inner dark square contains 3 × 3 small patches. The
intensity of the surrounding dark areas is set to 0, so as to
facilitate corner detection for the geometric calibration al-
gorithm [43]. To compensate the gamma characteristic of
LCDs, the 3×3 patches are pre-corrected using It = AI 1/γ
,
with Io equals [0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9] and A equals 255. We have
observed spatial inconsistency when the camera is tilted
away from the LCD monitor. This is because the observed
intensities of the same screen point will change according to
the viewing directions. We thus use small patches and take
the average for the same patches in all squares to alleviate
this effect.

usually smooth and monotonically increasing. Therefore the

W := {g | g(0) = 0, g(1) = 1, ∂g/∂M > 0} .

(10)

Thanks to our gamma corrected checker pattern, the ICRF
estimation can be simply achieved by solving the following
convex quadratic program

ˆg = argmin

kI − g(M)k2 + λ|

g∈W

∂ 2g
∂M 2 |,

(11)

where I denotes the stacked linear irradiance in matrix form,
and M the stacked observations. λ is a weighting factor,
which is ﬁxed to 0.001.
Polarizer angle estimation. After recovering the ICRF, the
method described in Section 4.1 can be used to estimate
polarizer angles.
Bundle adjustment. As shown in Figure 3(b), the monitor
gamma might slightly deviate from 2.2. The consequence is
that the ICRF estimation and the subsequent angle estimation
might be inaccurate. To account for this issue, we propose
to jointly reﬁne the ICRF and the polarizer angles, by using
nonlinear optimization similar to bundle adjustment. We
minimize the following cost function

K

P

Xk=1

Xp=1

ktp (c(2φk)c(2ψp)+s(2φk)s(2ψp)+1)−g(Mk,p)k2 ,

(12)
where c(·) and s(·) denote cos(·) and sin(·) respectively.
We use the fmincon function in Matlab for minimization,
which is initialized by using the estimated ICRF ˆg, phase
angle ˆψ, and polarizer angles ˆφ.

Note that the validity of the objective function in Equa-
tion (12) does not rely on the monitor gamma, even if it
is different from 2.2. The monitor gamma can affect the
initialization only.

5. Experiments

5.1. Simulation

We ﬁrst conduct experiments based on the synthetic data,
to validate our method. The synthetic data are generated
using 201 inverse CRFs from the database [12]. A zero-
mean Gaussian noise N (0, σ2) with σ = 2 is added. The
root mean square error (RMSE) is used as evaluation metrics.
Known inverse CRF. When the ICRF is given, we can com-
pare our method with Schechner’s method [32] directly. For

Schechner’s method [32], we use random initialization of
the angles. We run these two methods 100 times. Differ-
ent numbers of polarizing channels are tested (K = 18 and
K = 4) for validating how the number of channels affect
the methods’ performance. Figure 6(a-b) shows the results.
We found that 1) our method performs well and the result
is close to the ground truth. 2) Schechner’s method is sensi-
tive to initialization, but our method doesn’t suffer from this
problem. 3) Schechner’s method is less reliable when the
number of angles is small while ours is still robust.
Unknown inverse CRF. We apply our method and Teo’s
method [36] to these synthetic data to estimate the polarizer
angles along with the ICRF. We obtain that using our method,
the RMSE of mean angles is about 0.18/0.09 degrees for K =
18 and K = 4. For Teo’s method, the RMSE of mean angles
and mean of std. are as high as 5.18/8.26 and 17.10/19.79,
respectively (Figure 6(c-d)). We observe that this high error
is due to the camera response nonlinearity in the data and
random initialization. Teo’s method [36] often requires a
near ground truth initial guess to work well.
Sensitivity analysis. We conduct thorough sensitivity anal-
ysis to assess the performance (angular RMSE) as a function
of the noise std. (Figure 7). We observe that 1) Schechner’s
method is not sensitive to noise, but to initialization. 2) Our
linear method is sensitive to large noise. 3) Our joint method
can suppress noise effectively.

5.2. Real world Experiments

Experiment setup. For real experiments, we use a Point-
Grey GS3-U3-15S5M-C grayscale camera and a polarizer
in the visible range (SIGMA KOKI SPF-30C-32) to capture
images. An accurate mechanical rotator is used to obtain the
ground truth of the polarizer angles. The Thinkpad T470S
is used as the LCD monitor in experiments, with another
mechanical rotator equipped for rotating it.

The other is captured under the environment illumination
(bright room data). To address environment illumination in
the bright room data, we capture images when the monitor
is switched off and subtract them from input data. Table 1
shows the results of applying our method to the dark room
and bright room data respectively. We can ﬁnd that the effect
of environmental illumination can be reliably removed via
subtraction, and our method can achieve good results. In
addition, by estimating ICRF simultaneously, the polarizer
angles can be estimated more accurately since the given
ICRF could contain errors.

Effectiveness of using less polarizer angles. Figure 8
presents the comparison of different numbers of polarizer
angles. Our method is robust with the decrease in the number
of polarizer angles, while Schechner’s method becomes less
reliable with fewer polarizer angles.
Effectiveness of point selection. Previous polarization cal-
ibration methods [32, 36] are image-based self-calibration
methods. They all require carefully selected pixels. Our
method beneﬁts from the use of LCD monitors. 1) Polar-
ization characteristics of LCD monitors provide us a good
source of polarization. 2) The adapted checker pattern gives
us infomation on feature points. It is easy for us to choose
valid points. We compute the distribution of DoP in [32]
released data (i.e., btest and lab) with our dark room and
bright room data. Figure 9 shows the results.
Beneﬁts of the adapted checker pattern P3. Table 2 com-
pares patterns and shows that when ICRF is known the stan-

dard checker pattern can achieve the same accuracy. When
ICRF is unknown, the proposed joint calibration approach
can obtain estimates very close to the ground truth. P1 suf-
fers from spatial inconsistency and is less reliable. The result
using P2 could be more accurate. However, it would require
more images. In addition, the accurate estimated ICRF could
be distorted during BA process for reducing polarizer angle
errors. P3 gives results close to P2 but with less images.

Joint calibration vs. separate calibration. It is possible to
conduct the polarization calibration and the CRF calibra-
tion separately. In this case, our proposed method will still
be very useful. For example, when the ICRF is given, our
linear polarization calibration method can be used. When
the ICRF is unknown, it is possible to calibrate it by devel-
oping a separate method (in Table 3, we put the separately
estimated CRF using P2 and phase angle using P0 into our
linear method). Yet, our ﬁnding is that the use of P3 will
give a rough calibration of the camera response, and linking
camera radiometric calibration with polarization calibration
through bundle adjustment will greatly improve the accuracy
of both. The cost to pay is very small here, since the image
capture process is completely the same as in pure geomet-
ric calibration. With the proposed estimation method and
bundle adjustment step, experiments (Table 3) show that our
calibration results are very close to the ground truth, indicat-
ing that joint calibration is both effective and efﬁcient. The
calibration efﬁciency is crucial in many scenarios. We thus
believe our joint calibration method can be a convenient and
integrated tool for polarizing imaging.

Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. We com-
pare our method with the state-of-the-art methods [32, 36]
using real images (bright room data). Figure 10 presents
the comparison results. We can observe that our method
has the best performance in polarizer angle estimation. In
addition, it gives an accurate estimation of ICRF. When the
ICRF is not given, Schechner’s method fed with a CRF es-
timated using P2 performs poorly. If the ICRF is given, its
performance becomes much better, but still worse than ours,

3749

due to occasional poor convergence from random initializa-
tion. We observe Schechner’s method often suffers from
the problem that the estimated angles are perpendicular to
ground truth. For fair comparison, we reverse manually its
results when necessary. Teo’s method [36] is an image-based
self-calibration method. It gives a rough estimation of ICRF,
but the involvement of ICRF estimation makes their results
worse. It is also sensitive to initialization.

screen (b) has no spatially varying phase shift, the emitted
light is not completely polarized. The iPhone 7 Plus screen
(c) exhibits obvious color change and spatially varying phase
shift, as the polarizer rotates. Therefore, both can not be used
for our calibration task. To play safe, we recommend to use
a desktop or laptop monitors without a touch panel for the
calibration task.

6. Discussions

Applicability. For cameras with a mosaicing polarization
array, the polarizer angle is ﬁxed and known beforehand.
Thus, polarization calibration for such cameras is basically
unnecessary. However, such cameras have well-known is-
sues of strong cross-talks between different channels and
spatial nonuniformness. So, we believe that rotating a polar-
izer by hand in front of a ﬁxed camera will still be a common
practice in low-cost polarizing imaging, for which our cali-
bration method is very useful. For high-quality polarizing
imaging of dynamic scenes, the multi-sensor solution will
still be indispensable. It is sometimes desirable to adjust
the polarizing angles according to the target. The Spectral
Devices Inc. released such a multi-sensor camera system [4],
which allows users to insert proper polarizing ﬁlters accord-
ing to their speciﬁc applications. It will arouse the need
of radiometric and polarimetric calibration very frequently,
since it is hard to exactly control the ﬁlter’s angle when
inserting it into the camera.
LCD screens with a touch panel. LCD screens on most
mobile devices, such as cell phones, are equipped with a
touch panel on top of the front polarizer. We have examined
its effect by using a rotating polarizer. As shown in Figure 11,
three cell phones, including a HUAWEI Mate 10 Lite, an
Apple iPhone 6s and an Apple iPhone 7 Plus, were tested.
The HUAWEI Mate 10 Lite screen (a) functions in the same
way as a desktop LCD monitors, and can be used as the

Environment illumination. When the monitor is facing the
glass window or the ceiling lamp directly, we have observed
mixed polarizing light from the LCD monitor (active) and
the screen reﬂection (passive). Considering that the active
monitor light can be easily switched off, a simple subtrac-
tion method of the environment background has been proven
effective. Instead of subtraction, the screen could cause re-
ﬂective polarization, which is related to the azimuth angle
of the normal perpendicular to the screen (or the front po-
larizer). We will explore how to model this mixture in our
future work.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed to jointly calibrate the
camera response function and the polarizer angles of a po-
larizing camera by viewing an adapted checker pattern dis-
played on an LCD monitor. The image capturing operation
is very similar to that in geometric camera calibration us-
ing a 2D checker pattern, except for the mild requirement
that at least one view has in-plane rotation against the oth-
ers. By leveraging the gamma characteristic, the radiometric
calibration can be easily conducted through a convex pro-
gram. Thanks to the lighting principles of LCD monitors
and the extrinsic parameters from geometric calibration, our
calibration method for polarizer angles is linear. The initial
estimates can be jointly improved through a bundle adjust-
ment like operation. Experiment results have veriﬁed the
accuracy and reliability of our proposed calibration method.
Considering that LCD monitors are everywhere, we believe
our method will facilitate polarimetric imaging.
