Abstract

In radiologists’ routine work, one major task is to read
a medical image, e.g., a CT scan, ﬁnd signiﬁcant lesions,
and describe them in the radiology report. In this paper, we
study the lesion description or annotation problem. Given
a lesion image, our aim is to predict a comprehensive set
of relevant labels, such as the lesion’s body part, type, and
attributes, which may assist downstream ﬁne-grained diag-
nosis. To address this task, we ﬁrst design a deep learning
module to extract relevant semantic labels from the radi-
ology reports associated with the lesion images. With the
images and text-mined labels, we propose a lesion annota-
tion network (LesaNet) based on a multilabel convolutional
neural network (CNN) to learn all labels holistically. Hier-
archical relations and mutually exclusive relations between
the labels are leveraged to improve the label prediction ac-
curacy. The relations are utilized in a label expansion strat-
egy and a relational hard example mining algorithm. We
also attach a simple score propagation layer on LesaNet to
enhance recall and explore implicit relation between labels.
Multilabel metric learning is combined with classiﬁcation
to enable interpretable prediction. We evaluated LesaNet
on the public DeepLesion dataset, which contains over 32K
diverse lesion images. Experiments show that LesaNet can
precisely annotate the lesions using an ontology of 171 ﬁne-
grained labels with an average AUC of 0.9344.

1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been remarkable progress on
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on medical im-
ages, especially with the help of deep learning technologies
[23, 36]. Lesion classiﬁcation is one of the most important
topics in CAD. Typical applications include using medical
images to classify the type of liver lesions and lung tissues
[10, 15, 36], to describe the ﬁne-grained attributes of pul-

monary nodules and breast masses [5, 30], and to predict
their malignancy [6, 12]. However, existing studies on this
topic usually focus on certain body parts (lung, breast, liver,
etc.) and attempt to distinguish between a limited set of la-
bels. Hence, many clinically meaningful lesion labels cov-
ering different body parts were not explored yet. Besides,
in practice, multiple labels can be assigned per lesion and
are often correlated.

In this paper, we tackle a more general and clinically use-
ful problem to mimic radiologists. When an experienced ra-
diologist reads a medical image such as a computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scan, he or she can detect all kinds of lesions in
various body parts, identify the lesions’ detailed informa-
tion including its associated body part, type, and attributes,
and ﬁnally link these labels to the predeﬁned ontology. We
aim to develop a new framework to predict these semantic

labels holistically (jointly learning all labels), so as to go
one step closer to the goal of “learning to read CT images”.
In brief, we wish the computer to recognize where, what,
and how the lesion is, helping the user comprehensively un-
derstand it. We call this task lesion annotation due to its
analogy to the multilabel image annotation/tagging problem
in general computer vision literature [49].

To learn to annotate lesions, a large-scale and diverse
dataset of lesion images is needed. Existing lesion datasets
[8, 34] are typically either too small or less diverse. For-
tunately, the recently-released DeepLesion dataset [47, 48]
has largely mitigated this limitation. It contains bounding-
boxes of over 32K lesions from a variety of body parts on
CT images. However, there are no ﬁne-grained semantic
labels given for each lesion in DeepLesion. Manual annota-
tion is tedious, expensive, and not scalable, not to mention it
requires experts with considerable domain knowledge. In-
spired by recent studies [43, 41], we take an automatic data
mining approach to extract labels from radiology reports.
Reports contain rich but complex information about multi-
ple ﬁndings in the medical image. In the course of inter-
preting a CT scan, a radiologist may manually annotate a
lesion in the image, and place a hyperlink to the annotation
(a “bookmark”) in the report. We ﬁrst locate the sentence
with bookmark in the report that refers to a lesion, then ex-
tract labels from the sentence. We deﬁned a ﬁne-grained
ontology based on the RadLex lexicon [19]. This process
is entirely data-driven and requires minimal manual effort,
thus can be easily employed to build large datasets with rich
vocabularies. Sample lesion image, sentence, and labels can
be found in Fig. 1.

We propose a LESion Annotation NETwork (LesaNet)
to predict semantic labels given a lesion image of inter-
est. This lesion annotation task is treated as a multilabel
image classiﬁcation problem [49]. Despite extensive previ-
ous studies [11, 14, 16, 42, 21], our problem is particularly
challenging due to several reasons: 1) Radiology reports
are often in the format of free-text, so extracted labels can
be noisy and incomplete [43]. 2) Some labels are difﬁcult to
distinguish or learn, e.g. adjacent body parts, similar types,
and subtle attributes. 3) The labels are highly imbalanced
and long-tailed. To tackle these challenges, we present the
framework shown in Fig. 1. First, we reduce the noise in
training labels by a text-mining module. The module ana-
lyzes the report to ﬁnd the labels relevant to the lesion-of-
interest. Second, we build an ontology which includes the
hierarchical hyponymy and mutually exclusive relations be-
tween the labels. With the hierarchical relations, we apply
a label expansion strategy to infer the missing parent labels.
The exclusive relations are used in a relational hard exam-
ple mining (RHEM) algorithm to help LesaNet learn hard
cases and improve precision. Third, we also attach a simple
score propagation layer to enhance recall, especially for rare

labels. Finally, metric learning is incorporated in LesaNet
to not only improve classiﬁcation accuracy but also enable
prediction interpretability.

The main contributions of this work includes the fol-
lowing: 1) We study the holistic lesion annotation problem
and propose an automatic learning framework with mini-
mum manual annotation effort; 2) An algorithm is proposed
to text-mine relevant labels from radiology reports; 3) We
present LesaNet, an effective lesion annotation algorithm
that can also be adopted in other multilabel image classiﬁca-
tion problems; and 4) To leverage the ontology-based med-
ical knowledge, we incorporate label relations in LesaNet.

2. Related Work

Medical image analysis with reports: Annotating med-
ical images is tedious and requires considerable medical
knowledge. To reduce manual annotation burden, some re-
searchers leveraged the rich information contained in asso-
ciated radiology reports. Disease-related labels have been
mined from reports for classiﬁcation and weakly-supervised
localization on X-ray [43, 41] and CT images [35, 15]. This
approach boosts the size of datasets and label sets. How-
ever, current studies can only extract image-level labels,
which cannot be accurately mapped to speciﬁc lesions on
the image. The DeepLesion dataset1 consists of lesions
from a variety of body parts on CT images.
It has been
adopted to train algorithms for universal lesion detection
[46], retrieval [48], segmentation and measurement [3, 40].
This paper will explore its usage on lesion-level semantic
annotation. Another line of study directly generates reports
according to the whole image [44, 50]. Although the gen-
erated reports may learn to focus on certain lesions on the
image, it is difﬁcult to assess the usability of generated re-
ports. The key information in reports are the labels. If we
can accurately predict the labels for each lesion on the im-
age, the creation of high-quality (structured) reports would
be straightforward.

Multilabel image classiﬁcation: Multilabel image clas-
siﬁcation [49] is a long-standing topic that has been tackled
from multiple angles. A direct idea is to treat each label
independently and use a binary cross-entropy loss for each
[43]. The pairwise ranking loss is applied in [45, 14, 21] to
make the scores of positive labels larger than those of the
negative ones for each sample. The CNN-RNN framework
[42] uses a recurrent model to predict multiple labels one-
by-one. It can implicitly model label dependency and avoid
the score thresholding issue. In [11], deep metric learning
and hard example mining are combined to deal with imbal-
anced labels.

Noisy and incomplete training labels often exist

in
datasets mined from the web [7], which is similar to our la-

bels mined from reports. Strategies to handle them include
data ﬁltering [18], noise-robust losses [31], noise model-
ing [25], ﬁnding reliable negative samples [20], and so on.
We use a text-mining module to ﬁlter noisy positive labels
and leverage label relation to ﬁnd reliable negative labels.
Label relations have been exploited by researchers to im-
prove image classiﬁcation. Novel loss functions were pro-
posed in [9] for labels with hierarchical tree-like structures.
In [24, 16], prediction scores of different labels are propa-
gated between network layers whose structure is designed
to capture label relations. We apply label expansion and
RHEM strategies to use label relations explicitly, and at the
same time employ a score propagation layer to learn them
implicitly.

3. Label Mining and Ontology

3.1. Ontology Construction

We constructed our lesion ontology based on RadLex
[19], a comprehensive lexicon for standardized indexing
and retrieval of radiology information resources [26, 1].
The labels in our lesion ontology can be categorized into
three classes: 1. Body parts, which include coarse-level
body parts (e.g., chest, abdomen), organs (lung, lymph
node), ﬁne-grained organ parts (right lower lobe, pretra-
cheal lymph node), and other body regions (porta hepatis,
paraspinal); 2. Types, which include general terms (nodule,
mass) and more speciﬁc ones (adenoma, liver mass); and 3.
Attributes, which describe the intensity, shape, size, etc.,
of the lesions (hypodense, spiculated, large).

The labels in the lesion ontology are organized in a hier-
archical structure (Fig. 2). For example, a ﬁne-grained body
part (left lung) can be a part of a coarse-scale one (lung); a
type (hemangioma) can be a sub-type of another one (neo-
plasm); and a type (lung nodule) can locate in a body part
(lung). These relations form a directed graph instead of
a tree, because one child (lung nodule) may have multi-
ple parents (lung, nodule). Some labels are also mutually
exclusive, meaning that the presence of one label signiﬁes
the absence of others (e.g., left and right lungs). However,
in Fig. 2, chest and lymph node are not exclusive because
they may physically overlap; lung nodule and ground-glass
opacity are not exclusive either since they may coexist in
one lesion. We hypothesize that if labels a and b are exclu-
sive, any child of a and any child of b are also exclusive.
This rule can help us in annotation of exclusive labels.

the image of interest. In this work, we only used the sen-
tences with bookmarks to text-mine labels associated with
the lesions. First, we tokenized the sentence and lemma-
tized the words in the sentence using NLTK [2] to obtain
their base forms. Then, we matched the named entity men-
tions in the preprocessed sentences and normalized them to
labels based on their synonyms.

The bookmarked sentences often contain a complex
mixture of information describing not only the book-
marked lesion but also other related lesions and unrelated
things. A sample sentence is shown in Fig. 1, where the
word “BOOKMARK” is the hyperlink of interest, while
“OTHER BMK” is the hyperlink for another lesion. There
are 4 labels matched based on the ontology, namely large,
nodule, right lower lobe, and right middle lobe. Among
them, “right lower lobe” is irrelevant since it describes an-
other lesion.
In other examples, there are also uncertain
labels such as “adenopathy or mass”. Since both the irrel-
evant and uncertain labels may bring noise to downstream
training, we developed a text-mining module to distinguish
them from relevant labels. Speciﬁcally, we reformulate it
as a relation classiﬁcation problem. Given a sentence with
multiple labels and bookmarks, we aim to assign relevant
labels to each bookmark from all label-bookmark pairs.

To achieve that, we propose to use a CNN model based
on Peng et al. [28, 29]. The input of our model consists
of two parts: the word sequence with mentioned labels and
bookmarks, and the sentence embedding [4]. The model
outputs a probability vector corresponding to the type of the
relation between the label and the bookmark (irrelevant, un-
certain, and relevant). Due to space limit, we refer readers
to [29] for details about this algorithm.

After constructing the lesion ontology, we extracted la-
bels from the associated radiology reports of DeepLesion
[47]. In the reports, radiologists describe the lesions and
sometimes insert hyperlinks, size measurements, or slice
numbers (known as bookmarks) in the sentence to refer to

are used to train LesaNet and optimize the four losses. Modules in red are our main contributions.

4.1. Multiscale Multilabel CNN

The backbone of the network is VGG-16 [38] with batch
normalization [17]. In our task, different labels may be best
modeled by features at different levels. For instance, body
parts require high-level contextual features while many at-
tributes depict low-level details. Therefore, we use a multi-
scale feature representation similar to [48]. Region of in-
terest pooling layers (RoIPool) [13] are used to pool the
feature maps to 5 × 5 in each convolutional block. For
conv1 2, conv2 2, and conv3 3, the RoI is the bounding-
box of the lesion in the patch to focus on its details. For
conv4 3 and conv5 3, the RoI is the entire patch to capture
the context. Each pooled feature map is then projected to a
256D vector by a fully-connected layer (FC) and concate-
nated together. After another FC layer, the network outputs
a score vector s ∈ RC , where C is the number of labels.
Because positive cases are sparse for most labels, we adopt
a weighted cross-entropy (CE) loss [43] for each label as in
Eq. 1, where B is the number of lesion images in a mini-
batch; σi,c = sigmoid(si,c) is the conﬁdence of lesion i
having label c, whose ground-truth is yi,c ∈ {0, 1}; the loss
weights are βp
c = |Pc + Nc|/|2Nc|,
where Pc, Nc are the numbers of positive and negative cases
of label c in the training set, respectively.

occurs when radiologists did not describe every attribute of
a lesion or omitted the ﬁne-grained body part. Although it is
hard to retrieve these missing positive labels, we can utilize
the exclusive relations to ﬁnd reliable negative labels.
In
other words, if the expanded labels of a lesion are reliably
1, then their exclusive labels should be reliably 0.

One challenge of our task is that some labels are difﬁcult
to learn. We hope the loss function to emphasize them auto-
matically. Inspired by online hard example mining (OHEM)
[37], we deﬁne the online difﬁculty of label c of lesion i as:

δi,c = |σi,c − yi,c|γ,

(2)

γ > 0 is a focusing hyper-parameter similar to the focal loss
[22]. Higher γ puts more focus on hard examples. Then, we
sample S lesion-label pairs according to δ in the minibatch,
and compute their average CE loss. The higher δi,c is, the
more times it will be sampled. Hence, the loss will auto-
matically focus on hard lesion-label pairs. This stochastic
sampling strategy works better in our experiments than the
selection strategy in OHEM [37] and the reweighting one
in focal loss [22]. An important note is that the sampling is
only performed on reliable lesion-label pairs, so as to avoid
treating missing positive labels as hard negatives. RHEM
also works as a dynamic weighting mechanism for imbal-
anced labels, thus there is no need to impose weights [37]
as the β in Eq. 1. We combine the CE loss of RHEM with
Eq. 1 instead of replacing it, since some labels have no ex-
clusive counterparts and have to be learned from Eq. 1.

4.2. Leveraging Label Relations

4.3. Score Propagation Layer

Label expansion: Labels extracted from reports are not
complete. The hierarchical label relations can help us infer
the missing parent labels. If a child label is true, all its par-
ents should also be true. In this way, we can ﬁnd the labels
“right lung”, “lung”, and “chest” in Fig. 3 based on the ex-
isting label “right mid lung” in both training and inference.
Relational hard example mining (RHEM): Label ex-
pansion cannot complete other missing labels if their chil-
dren labels are not mentioned in the report. This problem

A score propagation layer (SPL) is attached at the end
of LesaNet (Fig. 3). It is a simple FC layer that reﬁnes the
predicted scores with a linear transformation matrix W , fol-
lowed by a weighted CE loss (Eq. 1). W is initialized with
an identity matrix and can learn to capture the ﬁrst-order
correlation between labels. Although the hierarchical and
exclusive label relations have been explicitly expressed by
label expansion and RHEM, it is still useful to have SPL
as it can enhance the scores of positively related labels and

8526

suppress the scores of labels with negative correlation and
clear separation. On the other side, some exclusive labels
can be very similar in location and appearance, for instance,
hemangioma and metastasis in liver. When SPL sees a high
score of hemangioma, it will know that it may also be a
metastasis since in some cases they are hard to distinguish.
Therefore, SPL will actually increase the score for metas-
tasis slightly instead of suppressing it. This mechanism is
particularly beneﬁcial to improve the recall of rare labels
whose prediction scores are often low. This rationale distin-
guishes SPL from previous knowledge propagation meth-
ods [16] that enforce negative weights on exclusive labels,
which led to a lower performance in our task. By observing
the learned W , we can also discover more label correlation
and compare them with our prior knowledge.

4.4. Multilabel Triplet Loss

Interpretability is important for CAD tasks [32]. We ex-
pect the algorithm to provide evidence for its predictions.
After classifying a lesion, it is desirable if LesaNet can show
lesions in the database that have similar labels, which will
help the user better understand its prediction as well as the
lesion itself. This is a joint lesion annotation and retrieval
problem. Lesion retrieval was studied in [48], but only 8
coarse-scale body part labels were used. In this paper, we
use the comprehensive labels mined from reports to learn a
feature embedding to model the similarity between lesions.
As shown in Fig. 3, an FC layer is applied to project the
multiscale features to a 256D vector, followed by a triplet
loss [33]. To measure the similarity between two images
with multiple labels, Zhao et al. [51] used the number of
common positive labels as a criterion. However, we argue
that each lesion may have a different number of labels, so
the number of disjoint positive labels also matters. Suppose
X and Y are the set of positive labels of lesions A and B,
we use the following similarity criterion:

5. Experiments

5.1. Dataset

From DeepLesion and its associated reports, we gath-
ered 19,213 lesions with sentences as the training set, 1,852
as the validation set, and 1,759 as the test set. Each patient
was assigned to one of the subsets only. The total number is
smaller than DeepLesion because not all lesions have book-
marks in the reports. We extracted labels as per Sec. 3.2,
then kept the labels occurring at least 10 times in the train-
ing set and 2 times in both the validation (val) and the test
sets, resulting in a list of 171 unique labels. Among them,
there are 115 body parts, 27 types, and 29 attributes. We
extracted hierarchical label relations from RadLex followed
by manual review and obtained 137 parent-child pairs. We
further invited a radiologist to annotate mutually exclusive
labels and obtained 4,461 exclusive pairs.

We manually annotated the label relevance (relevant / un-
certain / irrelevant, Sec. 3.2) in the val and test sets with two
expert radiologists’ veriﬁcation. As a result, there are 4,648
relevant, 443 uncertain, and 1,167 irrelevant labels in the
test set. The text-mining module was trained on the val set
and applied on the training set. Then, labels predicted as
relevant or uncertain in the training set were used to train
LesaNet. LesaNet was evaluated on the relevant labels in
the test set. Because the bookmarked sentences may not
include all information about a lesion, there may be miss-
ing annotations in the test set when relying on sentences
only. Hence, two radiologists further manually annotated
500 random lesions in the test set in a more comprehensive
fashion. On average, there are 4.2 labels per lesion in the
original test set, and 5.4 in the hand-labeled test set. An
average of 1.2 labels are missing in each bookmarked sen-
tence. We call the original test set the “text-mined test set”
because the labels were mined from reports. The second
hand-labeled test set is also used to evaluate LesaNet.

sim(A, B) = |X ∩ Y |2/|X ∪ Y |.

(3)

5.2. Implementation Details

When training, we ﬁrst randomly sample an anchor lesion
A from the minibatch, and then ﬁnd a similar lesion B from
the minibatch so that sim(A, B) ≥ θ, ﬁnally ﬁnd a dis-
similar lesion C so that sim(A, C) < sim(A, B). θ is the
similarity threshold. We sample T such triplets from the
minibatch and calculate the triplet loss:

Ltriplet =

1
T

T

(cid:2)

t=1

max(0, d(A, B) − d(A, C) + µ),

(4)

where d(A, B) is the L2 distance of the embeddings of A
and B, µ is the margin. Ltriplet makes lesions with similar
label sets closer in the embedding space.

The ﬁnal loss of LesaNet combines the four components:

L = LWCE + LCE, RHEM + LWCE, SPL + λLtriplet.

(5)

For each lesion, we cropped a 120mm2 patch around it
as the input of LesaNet. To encode 3D information, we
used 3 neighboring slices to compose a 3-channel image.
Other image preprocessing details are the same as [48]. For
the weighted CE loss, we clamped the weights β to be at
most 300 to ensure training stability. For RHEM, we set
γ = 2 and S = 104. For the triplet loss, we empirically set
θ = 1, µ = 0.1, and T = 5000. The triplet loss weight was
λ = 5 since this loss is generally smaller than other loss
terms. LesaNet was implemented using PyTorch [27] and
trained from scratch. Lesions with at least one positive label
were used in training. The batch size was 128. LesaNet
was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a
learning rate of 0.01 for 10 epochs, then with 0.001 for 5
more epochs.

5.3. Evaluation Metric

The AUC, i.e. the area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve, is a popular metric in CAD tasks
[43, 6]. However, AUC is a rank-based metric and does
not involve label decision, thus cannot evaluate the qual-
ity of the ﬁnal predicted label set in the multilabel setting.
Thus, we also computed the precision, recall, and F1 score
for each label, which are often used in multilabel image
classiﬁcation tasks [49]. Each metric was averaged across
labels with equal weights (per-class-averaging). Overall-
averaging [49] was not adopted because it biases towards
the frequent labels (chest, abdomen, etc.) which are less in-
formative. To turn conﬁdence scores into label decisions,
we calibrated a threshold for each label that yielded the best
F1 on the validation set, and then apply it on the test set.

5.4. Lesion Annotation Results

A comparison of different methods and an ablation study
of our method are shown in Table 1. The baseline method
is the multiscale multilabel CNN described in Sec. 4.1. The
weighted approximate ranking pairwise loss (WARP) [14]
is a widely-used multilabel loss that aims to rank positive la-
bels higher than the negative ones. We applied it to the mul-
tiscale multilabel CNN. We deﬁned that ﬁne-grained labels
should rank higher than coarse-scale ones if they are all pos-
itive. Lesion embedding [48] was trained on DeepLesion
based on labels of coarse-scale body parts, lesion location,
and size. Among these four methods, LesaNet achieved the
best AUC and F1 scores on the two test sets.

The AUCs in Table 1 are relatively high. The algorithms
have correctly ranked most positive cases higher than nega-
tive ones, proving the effectiveness of the algorithms. How-
ever, the F1 scores are relatively low. There are mainly two
reasons: 1) The dataset is highly imbalanced with many rare
labels. A total of 78 labels have fewer than 10 positive cases
in the text-mined test set. These labels may have many more
false positives (FPs) than true positives (TPs) when testing,
resulting in a low F1. 2) There are missing annotations in
the test sets, which is why the accuracies (especially preci-
sions) on the hand-labeled set are signiﬁcantly higher than
the text-mined test set.

Accuracies of some typical labels on the text-mined test
set are displayed in Table 2. The average AUC of body
parts, types, and attributes are 0.9656, 0.9044, and 0.8384,
respectively. Body parts are easier to predict since they typ-
ically have more regular appearances. The visual feature
of some labels (e.g., paraspinal, nodule) is variable, thus
harder to learn. The high AUC and low F1 of “paraspinal”
can be explained by the lack of positive test cases (see
the explanation in the last paragraph). Some types (e.g.,
metastasis) can be better predicted by incorporating ad-
ditional prior knowledge and reasoning. Attributes have
lower AUCs partially because some attributes are subjec-
tive (“large”) or can be subtle (“sclerotic”). Besides, radiol-
ogists typically do not describe every attribute of a lesion in
the report, thus there are missing annotations in the test set.
Fig. 4 demonstrates examples of our predictions.
LesaNet accurately predicted the labels of many lesions.
For example, in subplots (a) and (b), two ﬁne-grained body
parts (right hilum and pretracheal lymph nodes) were iden-
tiﬁed; In (c) and (d), a ground-glass opacity and a cavitary
lung lesion; In (g) and (h), a hemangioma and a metasta-
sis in liver. Some attributes were also predicted correctly,
such as “calciﬁed” in (e), “lobular” in (h), and “tiny” in (i).
Errors can occur on some similar body parts and types. In
(c), although “left lower lobe” has a high score, “left up-
per lung” was also predicted, since the two body parts are
close. In (g), “metastasis” is a wrong prediction as it may be
hard to be distinguished from hemangioma in certain cases.
Some rare and / or variable labels were not learned very
well, such as “conglomerate” and “necrosis” in (b). Please
see the supplementary material for more results.

It is efﬁcient to jointly learn all labels holistically. Fur-
thermore, our experiments showed that it does not affect the
accuracy of single labels. We conducted an experiment to
train and test LesaNet on subsets of labels. For example,
subset 1 consists of labels with more than 1000 occurrences
in the training set (ntr > 1000); Subset 2 contains labels
with ntr > 500. When trained on subset 2, we can test on
both subsets 1 and 2 to see if the accuracy on subset 1 has
degraded. The results are exhibited in Fig. 5. We can see
that for the same test set, the F1 score did not change sig-
niﬁcantly as the number of training labels increased. Thus,
with more data harvested, we may safely add more clini-
cally meaningful labels into training. On the other hand, as
more rare labels were added to the test set, the F1 became
lower. Fine-grained body parts, types, and many attributes
are rare. They are harder to learn due to the lack of train-
ing cases. Possible solutions include harvesting more data
automatically [47] and using few-shot learning [39].

age per-class recall by 3%. Among it, the recall of fre-
quent labels (ntr > 1000) only decreased 0.4%, show-
ing that SPL is important for the recall of rare labels, at
the cost of small precision loss. We further examined the
learned transformation matrix W in SPL, see Fig. 6 for
an example. We can ﬁnd that W (liver, hemangioma) and
W (enhancing, hemangioma) are high. It means SPL dis-
covered the fact that if a lesion is a hemangioma in DeepLe-

sion, it is highly likely in the liver and enhancing, so SPL
increased the scores for “liver” and “enhancing”. In turn,
the scores of liver and enhancing also contributed positively
to the ﬁnal score of hemangioma (see Fig. 4 (g) for an ex-
ample of hemangioma). Note that these relations were not
explicitly deﬁned in the ontology. The label “chest” is ex-
clusive with “abdomen” and “liver”, so the learned weights
between them are negative. As explained in Sec. 4.3, he-

mangioma and metastasis in the liver are hard for the algo-
rithm to distinguish, so SPL also learned positive weights
between them. In the future, using our holistic and compre-
hensive prediction framework, we may try to incorporate
more human knowledge into the model, such as “type a lo-
cates in body part b and has attribute c”, “type d is similar
to type e except for attribute f ”.

Relational hard example mining: RHEM, on the con-
trary to SPL, is crucial for improving the precision (Table
1), probably because it suppressed the scores of the reliable
hard negative labels at the cost of mildly decreased recall.
In RHEM, the hard negative labels of a lesion were selected
from the exclusive labels of existing positive ground-truths.
If we discard this “reliable” requirement and select negative
labels from all labels that are not positive, the precision will
increase 1.5% because we suppressed more negative labels,
but the recall will decrease 4% since many suppressed neg-

ative labels are actually positive due to missing annotations.
Label expansion: Without it, the training set will lose

40% (parent) labels, thus the accuracy was not good.

Text-mining module: When this was not used, the
overall accuracy dropped as the irrelevant training labels
brought noises. However, the performance did not degrade
substantially, showing that our model is able to tolerate
noisy labels to a certain degree [18]. We also found training
with the relevant + uncertain labels was better than using
relevant labels only, which is because most uncertain labels
are radiologists’ inferences that are very likely to be true,
especially if we only consider the lesion’s appearance.

Triplet loss: The triplet loss also contributed to the clas-
siﬁcation accuracy slightly. The 256D embedding learned
from the triplet loss can be used to retrieve similar lesions
from the database given a query one. In Fig. 7, LesaNet not
only predicted the labels of the query lesion correctly, but
also retrieved lesions with the same labels, although their
appearances are not identical. The retrieved lesions and re-
ports can provide evidences to the predicted labels as well
as help the user understand the query lesion.

More qualitative and quantitative results are presented in

the supplementary material.

6. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we studied the holistic lesion annotation
problem, and proposed a framework to automatically learn
clinically meaningful labels from radiology reports and la-
bel ontology. A lesion annotation network was proposed
with effective strategies that can both improve the accuracy
and bring insights and interpretations. Our future work may
include harvesting more data to better learn rare and hard
labels and trying to incorporate more human knowledge.
