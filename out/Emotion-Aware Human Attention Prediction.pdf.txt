Abstract

Despite the recent success in face recognition and ob-
ject classiﬁcation, in the ﬁeld of human gaze prediction,
computer models are still struggling to accurately mimic
human attention. One main reason is that visual attention
is a complex human behavior inﬂuenced by multiple fac-
tors, ranging from low-level features (e.g., color, contrast)
to high-level human perception (e.g., objects interactions,
object sentiment), making it difﬁcult to model computation-
ally. In this work, we investigate the relation between ob-
ject sentiment and human attention. We ﬁrst introduce an
improved evaluation metric (AttI) for measuring human at-
tention that focuses on human ﬁxation consensus. A series
of empirical data analyses with AttI indicate that emotion-
evoking objects receive attention favor, especially when they
co-occur with emotionally-neutral objects, and this favor
varies with different image complexity. Based on the em-
pirical analyses, we design a deep neural network for hu-
man attention prediction which allows the attention bias on
emotion-evoking objects to be encoded in its feature space.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate its su-
perior performance, especially on metrics that evaluate rel-
ative importance of salient regions. This research provides
the clearest picture to date on how object sentiments inﬂu-
ence human attention, and it makes one of the ﬁrst attempts
to model this phenomenon computationally.

1. Introduction

Predicting where humans will look in a scene (i.e.,
saliency prediction) has attracted a signiﬁcant amount of
research because of its potential applications such as in
social advertising and robot vision. Classic bottom-up
methods like the Itti-Koch model [18] and Graph-Based
Visual Saliency (GBVS) [15] use low-level features such
as color,
intensity, and orientations. Recently, numer-
ous saliency models based on deep neural network (DNN)
have been proposed with largely improved performance
[17, 6, 20, 7, 22]. Although these DNN-based models are

Figure 1. (a) We ﬁrst introduce an improved metric (AttI) for eval-
uating human attention. Analyses show that AttI can better reﬂect
human attention consensus on images of various complexity com-
pared with previously used Attention Score (AS). (b) Motivated
by our empirical data analyses, we propose the Emotion-Aware
saliency model (EASal) that incorporates information of object
proposals with sentiment labels (red, gray, blue indicate positive,
neutral, and negative sentiments, respectively).

trained with massive amounts of labeled data [8, 19] and
equipped with superior object recognition ability, there is
still a large gap between their predictions and ground truth
human ﬁxations. Aiming to address this limitation, Bylin-
skii and colleagues [4] re-examined current saliency mod-
els, and argued that to approach human-level performance,
saliency models need to discover high-level image concepts,
such as text or motion, and reason about the relative impor-
tance of image regions.

One possible high-level image concept is emotion, a fac-

4026

tor known to inﬂuence human attention [12, 35]. Behav-
ioral observations show that people pay attention to affec-
tive rather than neutral stimuli, and this commonly hap-
pens spontaneously [23]. In a visual search task, the ob-
ject can be easily found if it contains affective value [35],
e.g., a snake among ﬂowers. Initial work has been intro-
duced to explore saliency prediction with emotion informa-
tion [24, 11]. However, the work in [24] did not analyze
how exactly emotion inﬂuences human attention, and [11]
did not identify emotion-evoking objects or regions. Indeed,
more efforts are needed to study how emotion can be used
in predicting human attention.

Our work is motivated by the above research but we go
further. Aiming to have a deeper look at emotional atten-
tion, we ﬁrst evaluate quantitatively how different emotion-
eliciting objects impact human attention. We propose an
improved evaluation metric (AttI) which focuses on human
ﬁxation consensus and study it under various image com-
plexity. With AttI, we discover that emotion-evoking ob-
jects are prioritized in human attention, and such prioriti-
zation effect is modulated by image complexity. Moreover,
it is most signiﬁcant when they co-occur with emotionally
neutral objects. Based on the human ﬁndings, we propose a
DNN-based model that identiﬁes emotion-evoking objects
in an image and incorporates such information in saliency
prediction. Results on two benchmark datasets show that
the proposed emotion-aware saliency model outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of pre-
dicting the relative importance of salient regions within an
image (see Fig. 1). Our main contributions are as follows:

1. We introduce an improved metric to assess human at-
tention. The improved metric Attention Index (AttI), which
focuses on human consensus of ﬁxation, allows us to better
study the relation between attention and object sentiments.
2. We provide a comprehensive picture on how objects
with different sentiments compete for human attention un-
der different scene complexity.

3. We introduce an emotion-aware DNN model for pre-
dicting human attention that utilizes object sentiment infor-
mation. With a subnetwork based on detected image com-
plexity and context, the new model conditionally integrates
the predicted emotion information in the ﬁnal saliency map.

2. Related Work

Emotional attention:
In psychology, human attention is
considered as a state of arousal, during which human brains
selectively concentrate on a discrete aspect of informa-
tion, while ignoring others [1]. Due to their evolutionary
salience, threat- and reward-related stimuli, such as snakes,
angry faces, and delicious food constitute a special class of
stimuli believed to capture human attention in a rapid, or
even involuntary manner [25]. This “automatic” capture of
attention is supported by research in neuroscience, which

has unraveled neural pathways for emotional stimuli pro-
cessing [36]. The above works lead us to look at emotion in
saliency prediction.

Predicting human attention: The legacy approaches of
saliency prediction [18, 15] are based on Feature Integra-
tion Theory of attention which suggests that features are
registered automatically and in parallel across the visual
ﬁeld.
In recent DNN-based saliency models, human at-
tention at different resolutions is assembled in SALICON
[17] and DeepFix [20]. Some models incorporate the hu-
man central ﬁxation bias in their system either by superim-
posing the center priors [21, 6] or by learning [7]. These
models took advantage of the representational power of the
semantic-rich DNN feature detectors trained on ImageNet
[8]. Although these models have largely boosted the perfor-
mance for saliency prediction, they are mainly trained on
the datasets and learn weights as a whole, enabling few in-
sights on how different objects in an image compete for hu-
man attention. Different from existing networks, our study
focuses on the relative importance of salient regions.

Predicting emotional regions in images: Peng et al. [28]
and Sun et al. [33] both introduced systems which predict
the affective regions in an image. The authors in [28] pro-
posed the prediction of Emotion Stimuli Map which esti-
mates the pixel-wise contribution to evoked emotion of an
image. The work in [33] used object proposals and emotion
score to determine an affective region. More recently, Yang
et al. [38] presents a system for automatic identiﬁcation of
the affective region using image-level label. These studies
demonstrate that emotion-evoking region are predictable.
However, how the resulting emotion-evoking maps/regions
reﬂect visual saliency remains unclear. Our work aims to
bridge the two types of knowledge through empirical data
analyses and computational modeling.

Attention prediction with emotion: Saliency
re-
searchers have made initial attempts to incorporate emotion
in attention prediction, such as the human ﬁxation datasets
featuring emotional contents [29, 11], saliency models
that identiﬁes emotional objects, such as faces [31, 24],
injury, worm and snake [24]. The work closest to ours is
[11], in which the authors made a preliminary study on
the relation between image sentiment and visual saliency,
and reported an emotion prioritization effect for emotion-
eliciting content. Their work is insightful but it also leads
to the following unresolved questions:
(1) the authors
used “object attention score” (the maximum ﬁxation-map
value inside the objects contour) to measure an object’s
attention level. This is inadequate as the ﬁxation map was
normalized, leading to a situation that each object receives
an attention score close to 1 in a very scattered ﬁxation

4027

Figure 2. The proposed evaluation metric Attention Index (AttI)
which focuses on human consensus can identify more intricate dif-
ferences than attention score (AS). For images with fewer than 4
labeled objects in EMOd dataset, AttI shows a notable difference
between the emotion-evoking objects and neutral objects whereas
AS shows none. The difference on AttI is mainly due to the differ-
ence on Human Consensus Score. In all ﬁgures in this paper, error
bars represent the standard error of means. The asterisks denote

map (see Fig. 1 (a)); (2) the proposed saliency model in
[11] did not identify speciﬁc object sentiments,
thus it
is hard to say if the performance improvement is due to
emotion or due to other factors (e.g. more information
learned about semantics, spatial location, and so on).
In
our work, we focus on human consensus in measuring each
object’s attention level. We show that factoring human
consensus allows us to better describe the relative attention
level of emotion-evoking objects and emotionally-neutral
objects under various image complexities. We use our
human ﬁndings to guide the design of an emotion-aware,
DNN-based saliency model with object sentiment masks.

3. Empirical data analyses on emotion and at-

tention

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce an improved evalua-
tion metric (AttI) for measuring human attention. We then
conduct a series of statistical analyses using this metric.
The analyses were performed on the EMOtional attention
dataset (EMOd) proposed in [11]. EMOd contains 1019
emotional images each with detailed object sentiment la-
bel (positive, negative and neutral) and has eye ﬁxation data
collected from 16 human subjects.

3.1. Attention Index: an improved way of measur 

ing human attention

In the ﬁeld of saliency research, most of the previous
studies [10, 37, 11] used the attention score (hereafter AS) of
an object deﬁned as the maximum value of the normalized
ﬁxation map inside the object’s contour. However, when
comparing the attention levels of objects among different

images each with various complexities1, the relative impor-
tance of different objects are concealed due to the normal-
ization procedure during the ﬁxation map generation. For
example, consider two images. The ﬁrst image with several
objects has rather scattered human ﬁxations, and each ob-
ject receives an AS score close to 1 after the normalization
of the ﬁxation map. In contrast, the second image has a sin-
gle object standing out among others, catching most human
attention, thus it will also have an AS score close to 1. The
objects in the two images receive different level of human
attention but have similar high AS score due to ﬁxation map
normalization. Thus, AS alone is inadequate to reﬂect the
human attention level for objects among various images.

To address the above limitation, we propose an improved
metric to measure human attention, we name it Attention
Index (AttI). To do this, we ﬁrst deﬁne human consensus
of ﬁxation score (HCS), which measures the consensus of
observers’ ﬁxation on an object. We adopt the agreement
ratio of the Fleiss’ kappa [13] for the ith subject as the HCS
of n observers for the ith object provided in Eqs. 1 and 2.

HCS = (Pi − Pmin)/(1 − Pmin)

ment (50% ﬁxated and 50% not ﬁxated), i.e.,
represents the non-ﬁxated and ﬁxated groups. That is, nij
for j = 1 is the number of observers who do not ﬁxate on
the ith object and nij for j = 2 is the number of observers
who ﬁxate on the ith object. HCS = 1.0 if all observers
agree to ﬁxate or do not ﬁxate on an object and HCS = 0.0
for a complete disagreement. Using HCS alone is inade-
quate to indicate an object’s attention level, as it generates
high scores for objects in both cases when they are ﬁxated
or not ﬁxated by most of the observers. To address this, we
multiply HCS with AS for the ﬁnal AttI (refer to Eq. 3).
The AttI range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

AttI = HCS × AS

Fig.

2 illustrates the advantage of AttI over AS in
practice. We computed the average AttI, AS and HCS of
emotion-evoking and neutral objects in all EMOd images
with low complexity (i.e. containing fewer than four labeled
objects). Independent-samples t-test indicate no signiﬁcant
difference on the AS of emotional objects and neutral ob-
jects (p = 0.162). However, independent-samples t-test
on AttI reveals that emotion-evoking objects indeed have a

higher AttI than neutral objects (p = 0.010). As shown in
Fig. 2, the signiﬁcant difference on AttI is mainly carried by
the difference on HCS (p = 0.008), suggesting the efﬁcacy
of considering human consensus.

3.2. Effect of emotion under different image com 

plexity

With the improved evaluation metric AttI, we are able
to explore in detail how emotion-evoking and neutral ob-
jects compete for attention under varying image complex-
ity. We performed a series of analyses using inferential
statistics. More speciﬁcally, we considered two groups of
images: (1) images with co-occurring objects with similar
sentiments (e.g., all negative or all positive); (2) images with
co-occurring objects with different sentiments (i.e., posi-
tive/negative objects co-occur with neutral objects2). For
the ﬁrst group, there are 50, 94 and 387 images which con-
tain only positive, negative, neutral objects, respectively.
For the second group, there are 137 images which contain
both positive and neutral objects, and 342 images which
contain both negative and neutral objects. In each group, we
classiﬁed images into seven subgroups based on the num-
ber of labeled objects contained in the image (see Fig. 3).
We then computed the average AttI of objects with positive,
neutral, and negative sentiment labels, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 3 (a), for images with co-occurring
objects with similar sentiments, when the image complex-
ity increases, the difference of AttI between the emotion-
evoking objects and the neutral objects is more signiﬁcant
than in less complex images. For more complex images
(e.g., images with more than 6 objects), the advantage of
the emotion-evoking objects for human attention is reduced.
This is understandable as when there are too many stimuli
that catch human eyes, the effect from an individual stimuli
will be weakened. For images with co-occurring emotion-

2There are only 9 images in EMOd that contain both positive and neg-
ative objects, which is a very small sample size for us to reasonably detect
an effect. Thus, we exclude this case in our statistical analyses.

evoking objects and neutral objects, the AttI difference be-
tween emotion-evoking objects and neutral objects remains
large even when the image complexity increases (see Fig. 3
(d)). This suggests that emotion-evoking objects are most
advantageous when they co-occur with neutral objects, and
such priority is manifested on human attention consistency
regardless of image complexity.

To summarize, in this section we propose an improved
metric AttI for measuring human attention, which takes
into account human consensus under different image com-
plexity. Our empirical data analyses with AttI indicate that
emotion-evoking objects are prioritized in human attention.
Such prioritization effect is modulated by image complex-
ity, and is most signiﬁcant when they co-occur with emo-
tionally neutral objects. Our ﬁndings are consistent with
previous studies on emotional attention [25, 11], but provide
a more nuanced evidence on how the emotion prioritization
effect is inﬂuenced by image context and complexity. Our
ﬁndings also guide us in the design of an emotion-aware
DNN saliency model, as described in the next section.

4. Emotion-aware saliency prediction

Based on our human ﬁndings, we design an emotion-
aware DNN model that integrates object sentiment infor-
mation in saliency prediction. Experiments on two bench-
mark datasets demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the emotion-
aware mechanisms, especially on metrics that measure the
relative importance of salient regions.

4.1. DNN architecture

We propose an Emotion-Aware Saliency model (here-
after EASal), as shown in Fig. 4. EASal is composed of
two branches: (1) semantic feature extraction and (2) sen-
timent mask generation. The semantic feature extraction
learns image semantics and multi-scale information to form
semantic feature maps. The sentiment mask generation de-
tects and localizes possible emotion-evoking objects, pre-
dicts the emotions evoked by these detected objects, and

Our proposed Emotion-Aware Saliency model (EASal) is composed of two branches: (1) the semantic feature extraction branch
which learns semantic information from the input image, and (2) the object-level sentiment mask generation branch which generates and
incorporates the objects’ sentiment masks to the feature maps from the semantic branch. We use a subnetwork (in green box) which
combines the two branches based on detected image complexity and object sentiments. If the output of the ReLU is greater than 0, all
feature maps will be combined via the last convolution ﬁlter block.

adjusts the predicted saliency of the corresponding affec-
tive regions in the feature maps. The combination of the two
branches is controlled by a subnetwork signal which takes
into consideration the image complexity and image context
(i.e., number of sentiment types co-occurring in the image).
Below we describe the two branches and the combination
mechanism, which resembles our empirical data analyses.

Two steps were implemented in the sentiment mask gen-
eration branch. First, we use Mask-RCNN [16] to generate
the contours of the object proposals. The object proposals
are then passed to the GoogleNet [34]-based object senti-
ment classiﬁcation (Fig. 4, lower left) to infer the object
sentiment. The sentiment mask generation branch outputs
three types of important information for human attention:
object contour, object position, and object sentiment.

Our empirical data analyses show that the emotion pri-
oritization effect depends on image complexity and image
context. Based on this ﬁnding, we introduce a signal con-
trol subnetwork (Fig. 4, green box) to automatically learn
whether the information from sentiment mask generation
branch should be incorporated in the ﬁnal saliency map. Af-
ter ﬁne-tuning, the subnetwork weights learned for image
complexity (no. of objects) and emotion types in the fully-
connected layer are −0.48, 2.46, respectively. With these
weights, the TanH and the ReLU layer at the output, we ob-
serve that the subnetwork combines (i.e. ReLU output > 0),
the emotion information in saliency prediction except when
(i.e. ReLU output = 0) the following conditions are met: (1)
the image is complex (i.e., more than 6 object proposals are

detected within the same image) and the image complexity
is within the common range (object no. < 11)); and (2)
the image contains only one type of object sentiment (i.e.
all detected objects sentiment labels were the same). This
is similar to our empirical data analyses. Experiments on
EMOd show that for images with similar object sentiments
and contain greater than 6 objects, integrating emotion data
will not improve their saliency prediction (Fig. 3 (a)).

Parallel to the sentiment mask generation branch, the
feature extraction branch consists of two VGG-16 [32]
modules that capture the object semantics and multi-
resolution information. The input image for each module
is of size 600×800 and 300×400, respectively. We tested
three integration architectures, namely early fusion, inter-
mediate fusion, and late fusion to determine the best way
to combine the two branches. We ﬁnally selected inter-
mediate fusion as experiments show that it has best per-
formance (refer to the supplementary material for details).
During the intermediate fusion, we removed the classiﬁer of
the VGG networks such that each module has 512 feature
maps as output. The 1024 feature maps are then copied to
each element-wise block of the positive, negative and neu-
tral emotion, and multiplied by a scaled version of the sen-
timent masks (1×1 convolution ﬁlters) to provide saliency
level correction to the corresponding emotion-evoking re-
gions (see the element-wise block in the lower right of Fig.
4). A concatenation layer and a 1×1 convolution ﬁlter are
used to combine the 4096 feature maps.

4.2. Training and testing

The training and testing are implemented using Caffe
framework. The feature extraction branch was ﬁrst ﬁne-
tuned using SALICON dataset [17] with momentum of 0.9
and initial learning rate of 10−5. The learning rate decreases
by a factor of 0.1 every 8000 iterations. As the SALICON
training dataset has no ground truth sentiment mask, the se-
mantic feature extraction branch is separately ﬁne-tuned.

The trained saliency prediction branch is then combined
with the sentiment mask generation branch for ﬁne-tuning.
Except for the ﬁrst two layers whose ﬁlter weights were
ﬁxed, all ﬁlter weights were ﬁne-tuned with momentum
of 0.9 and initial learning rate of 10−5. For the sentiment
mask generation branch’s three 1×1 convolution ﬁlters and
the subnetwork’s fully connected layer, the initial kernel
weights are set to 1 and all the kernel biases are ﬁxed to
0, so as to force the system to use the emotion informa-
tion. The learning rate multiplier is set to 10−3 and the bias
multiplier set to 0. The emotion classiﬁcation module in the
sentiment mask generation branch is trained separately. The
continuous ﬁxation maps were used as the ground truth. We
trained EASal using GeForce GTX TITAN X.

We evaluated EASal on two publicly available datasets
rich in emotion-evoking objects. The ﬁrst dataset is EMOd
[11] which consists of 1019 emotional images. We divided
EMOd into training set containing 776 images and test set
containing 243 images. Using the same dataset, we per-
formed 5-fold cross validation by randomly sampling 776
images into training and 243 images into test in each fold.
The second dataset is the CAT2000 [2] which is composed

of 2000 images from different categories. We used the af-
fective category of CAT2000.

4.3. Evaluation methods and results

We compared EASal with respect to other saliency mod-
els on the two aforementioned benchmark datasets. We
chose three other DNN-based models with available im-
plementation/code and no center-bias, namely SALICON
[17], SalGAN [26], and CASNet [11]. SALICON and Sal-
GAN are commonly used benchmarking models for several
saliency models e.g. [7, 20], while CASNet [11] focuses on
the relative saliency within an image. We also used two re-
cent non DNN-based models SROD [5] and BMS [39] and
two classical algorithms GBVS [15] and Itti-Koch [18]. We
further compared EAsal with a similar model but without
the sentiment mask generation branch (hereafter N-EASal).
The performance is measured using standard saliency
metrics (see [3] for details). AUC measures the salient ob-
ject detection capability of the model. The shufﬂed AUC
(sAUC) is similar to AUC but it penalizes models with cen-
ter bias in their design. CC and SIM treat saliency pre-
dictions as valid distribution. CC equally penalizes both
false positive and false negatives while SIM is sensitive to
false positive. EMD and KL are distance-based metrics
thus, lower values reﬂect better performance. IG measures
the ability of the model to make predictions above baseline
mode of center bias. It sums the information gain for each
saliency map pixel such that IG for images with different
size are incomparable. NSS is a discrete approximation of
CC. NSS, KL and IG take into consideration the range of

saliency map during evaluation thus capturing the relative
importance of image regions.

The quantitative results are reported in Table 1. EASal
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on metrics re-
ﬂecting relative saliency [4], i.e., NSS, KL, and IG. EASal
shows marginal improvement on AUC, sAUC, CC and SIM.
Notably, EASal outperforms N-EASal on almost all met-
rics, suggesting the efﬁcacy of the sentiment mask genera-
tion branch and the combination mechanism which is moti-
vated by our empirical data analyses.

The qualitative results are shown in Fig. 5. The emotion
labels of the object proposals are indicated using red, blue
and gray marks to signify positive, negative and neutral ob-
jects. When compared with other saliency models, EASal
is more effective in assigning relative importance for the la-
beled objects, either in less complex images (e.g., ﬁrst four
images in Fig. 5) or more complex images (e.g., last four
images in Fig. 5). When compared with N-EASal, EASal
yields better relative saliency prediction. A visualization
of the corrected image locations in N-EASal is shown in
the last column of Fig. 5. Higher saliency values are as-
signed to emotion-evoking objects and lower saliency val-
ues are assigned to emotionally-neutral objects. The results
demonstrate that EASal better embodies the phenomenon
that emotion-evoking objects attract human attention.

4.4. DNN visualization and discussion

An interesting observation in EASal training is the con-
vergence of the three 1 × 1 convolution ﬁlters to the follow-

ing values: 1.53, 1.32 and -0.90, which serve as multiplier
to the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment mask, re-
spectively. Note that there is a regularization function ReLU
at the output of these ﬁlters such that only the emotion-
evoking objects get ampliﬁed (i.e., receive higher saliency
prediction). In connection to this, we observe that the ad-
vantage of EASal over N-EASal is due to the increase in
saliency value for emotion-evoking objects, which naturally
leads to a decrease in the saliency values of neutral objects
when the predicted saliency map is normalized.

In producing the saliency maps, the output feature map
is directly mapped to the input image via image resizing.
Therefore, each output feature map node encapsulates the
predicted saliency of image regions. To visualize how emo-
tion information changes the predicted relative importance
of image regions, we show in Fig. 6 the top ﬁve nodes from
the output feature map of EASal and N-EASal. This is done
by selecting the ﬁve maximum node values from the 19×25
output feature map and locating their respective sections in
the 600×800 input image. These nodes correspond to the
predicted top ﬁve most important 32×32 regions in the in-
put image. For example, the node located at the ﬁrst row
and ﬁrst column of the output feature map corresponds to
the upper left 32×32 region of the input image.

We further quantify the changes in the saliency values
for emotion-evoking objects under various image complex-
ity. As shown in Fig. 7, images with objects of diverse
sentiments have higher percent increase in saliency value
than images with similar object sentiments. For more com-

4032

An important part of EASal is the object sentiment clas-
siﬁer. In the design of the object sentiment classiﬁer, be-
sides the labeled emotional and neutral objects from EMOd
[11], we further generated objects with sentiment labels
from COCO attributes [27] datasets based on their object-
level attributes. For example, COCO attributes “happy”
and “joyful” are converted to positive sentiments, whereas
“unhappy” and “sad” are linked to negative sentiments.
We used GoogleNet architecture for the emotion classiﬁer,
achieving 71.91% classiﬁcation performance on EMOd.
This suggests future space for improvement for EASal—its
performance will be even better if given a perfect emotion
classiﬁer. Due to space limit, we describe the details of the
emotion classiﬁer in the supplementary material.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an improved metric (AttI) for
evaluating human attention that takes into account human
consensus and image context (in terms of object sentiment).
AttI enables us to have a comprehensive picture on how
emotion-evoking objects compete for human attention un-
der various image context and image complexity. Our sta-
tistical analyses show that emotion-evoking objects attract
human attention, and such advantage is modulated by im-
age complexity and image context.

Based on the empirical data analyses, we propose
EASal—an emotion-aware DNN model for saliency predic-
tion. EASal fuses object sentiment information, by mod-
ulating the ﬁnal saliency map using the automatically de-
tected objects’ sentiment masks. Such modulation mecha-
nism is controlled by image complexity and image context
through a subnetwork whose parameters were automatically
learned. With two benchmark datasets featuring emotional
images, EASal exhibits notable improvement on evaluation
metrics that indicate relative importance of salient regions
within an image (i.e.., NSS, KL, IG), implying that integrat-
ing emotion information betters relative saliency prediction.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is a ﬁrst at-
tempt to quantify an object’s attention level while consider-
ing human consensus and image complexity. The proposed
saliency model is distinctive from existing models in that it
conditionally incorporates emotional information, in which
the condition is determined by the image context and image
complexity. In future work it will be interesting to inves-
tigate the relationship between human attention and other
measures, e.g. object interestingness [14], object memora-
bility [9], and traits of social relation within an image [30].

Figure 6. EASal emphasizes emotion-evoking objects. Here we
visualize the top ﬁve nodes from the output feature map of EASal
and N-EASal on ﬁve emotional images. The yellow squares in the
last two columns indicate the predicted top ﬁve most important re-
gions. The top ﬁve regions in EASal (3rd column) show stronger
emotions than those in N-EASal (4th column), suggesting the ef-
ﬁcacy of the proposed emotion integration mechanism.

Figure 7. EASal’s percent increase with respect to N-EASal in pre-
dicting the saliency of emotion-evoking objects. Emotion-evoking
objects appearing with different sentiments receive higher increase
in saliency levels as compared when the objects in an image are of
the same sentiment. Such advantage lessens when image complex-
ity increases, mainly due to EASal’s subnetwork signal, which dis-
ables the sentiment mask generation under high image complexity.

plex images (> 6 objects), the increase in saliency level of
co-occurring objects with similar sentiments is minimal as
compared to co-occurring objects with diverse sentiments.
These observations show that EASal successfully encodes
our empirical ﬁnding that attention favors emotion-evoking
objects, especially when they co-occur with objects with
different sentiments, regardless of image complexity.
