Abstract

In image co-saliency detection problem, one critical is-
sue is how to model the concurrent pattern of the co-salient
parts, which appears both within each image and across all
the relevant images.
In this paper, we propose a hierar-
chical image co-saliency detection framework as a coarse
to ﬁne strategy to capture this pattern. We ﬁrst propose a
mask-guided fully convolutional network structure to gener-
ate the initial co-saliency detection result. The mask is used
for background removal and it is learned from the high-level
feature response maps of the pre-trained VGG-net output.
We next propose a multi-scale label smoothing model to fur-
ther reﬁne the detection result. The proposed model joint-
ly optimizes the label smoothness of pixels and superpixel-
s. Experiment results on three popular image co-saliency
detection benchmark datasets including iCoseg, MSRC and
Cosal2015 demonstrate remarkable performance compared
with the state-of-the-art methods.

1. Introduction

Image saliency detection mimics human vision system
when looking at one image, through detecting the region
that attracts human attention most. Given a group of images,
the image co-saliency refers to common salient objects or
regions in a group of relevant images. Discovering image
co-saliency has been widely used as a pre-processing step
in many applications, such as video/image foreground co-
segmentaion [17, 16], object localization [42], surveillance
video analysis [37] and image retrieval [38, 47].

One major theme in co-saliency detection research is im-
age pixel or region feature representation. Traditional man-
ually designed cues such as color histograms, Gabor ﬁlters,
and SIFT descriptors, have been used in image co-saliency
detection [8, 41, 15]. However, due to the limited feature

discrimination, the performance of those methods are in
general unsatisfactory. More recently, the deep learning
methods have achieved superior accuracy because neural
networks can generate more discriminative feature repre-
sentations [51, 52]. The second major theme is to discov-
er the repeated saliency across all images through a prop-
er association strategy. The unsupervised learning meth-
ods look for the common objects or salient regions across
images, by a series of models such as clustering [53, 48],
multi-instance learning [54, 24] and graphical model [23].
With co-saliency label information, the supervised learn-
ing methods are promising to achieve more accurate result-
s. The supervised single image saliency detection method-
s [22, 56, 55] can be used for co-saliency detection. How-
ever, they ignore the pattern concurrency of salient regions
within all images, which is the essential characteristic of the
co-saliency detection problem compared with single image
saliency detection task. Several recent efforts are conducted
to model the between-image pattern concurrency in the for-
m of distance metric learning [20] and collaborative learn-
ing [45].

In this paper, the proposed hierarchical method is also
to capture the salient pattern concurrency across images.
Intuitively, image co-saliency can be derived from the sin-
gle image saliency repeated in all images [8]. This moti-
vates us to design a two-step framework. In the ﬁrst step,

we generate the initial co-saliency detection results by a
mask-guided fully convolutional network (FCN). The idea
of mask-guided network has been successfully applied in
various tasks such as object segmentation [12] and detec-
tion [57], because the mask encodes useful semantical and
spatial information and hence the learned convolutional fea-
tures are more discriminative with such a guidance. In our
network we use the mask to remove the background infor-
mation in convolutional feature learning, as shown in Fig-
ure 1 (d). The network co-saliency detection results of the
mask-guided FCN are further reﬁned by a multi-scale label
smoothing model, leading to the ﬁnal results in Figure 1 (e).
The proposed method has the following technical novelties:

• We propose a mask-guided FCN structure for image
co-saliency detection. The convolutional part of the
proposed network has two channels and the mask is
added at different convolutional layers in the two chan-
nels. The outputs of the two channels are merged and
fed into the deconvolution layers to obtain the initial
co-saliency detection results.

• To make the FCN targeted for the concurrent feature
pattern learning, a mask is used as a guidance in the
network. The mask is learned from the feature re-
sponse map output of a pre-trained VGG net [40]. We
design a learning objective that jointly maximizes the
mask variance and encourages entries of the mask to
be sparse. The designed learning objective is solved
by an ADMM-type algorithm.

• A multi-scale label smoothing model is proposed to
reﬁne the detection results of the masked-guided FCN.
The model considers the label smoothness of both im-
age superpixels and pixels. The superpixel smoothness
is modeled by manifold ranking and the pixel smooth-
ness is modelled by a fully-connected CRF objective.
An iterative optimization algorithm is designed to min-
imize the objective.

2.1. Single image saliency detection

Exhaustively introducing the related works is beyond the
scope of this paper, and some recent surveys about single-
image saliency detection can be found in [10, 5]. General-
ly, the existing single-image salient detection methods can
be categorized into unsupervised methods and supervised
methods [10]. The unsupervised methods detect image
saliency based on various prior knowledge as assumptions.
In [9], image saliency is detected by region contrast that is
evaluated by global contrast difference and spatial weight-
ed coherence scores. Other priors such as frequency do-
main analysis [1], sparse learning [30, 39], background pri-
or [61, 44] and compactness prior [60] are also considered

in literature. Supervised methods, especially deep learning
type models have demonstrated higher accuracy over unsu-
pervised methods. In [33], image saliency is detected by
predicting eye ﬁxations. Extensive efforts have been con-
ducted on network structure design, with multi-scale feature
fusion network [28], hierarchical network structure [32] and
skip-layer structures within the HED architecture [22] as
representative work. A black box classiﬁer is proposed
in [11] for real-time image saliency detection.

2.2. Image co saliency detection

Image co-saliency detection methods can be grouped
into bottom-up, fusion based and learning based ones.
Bottom-up methods score image regions based on feature
priors to simulate visual attention [29, 15, 18]. In [15], three
visual attention cues including contrast, spatial and corre-
sponding are adopted. Background and foreground cues are
used in a two-stage propagation framework in [18]. Fusion
based methods ensemble the detection results of existing
saliency or co-saliency methods. For example, Cao et al.
obtain the self-adaptive weight via rank constraint to com-
bine the co-saliency maps [7] and Huang et al. use mul-
tiscale superpixels to jointly detect salient object via low-
rank analysis [25]. High-level semantic features from C-
NNs are extracted in [54, 52] to discover inter-image cor-
respondence. Learning based methods have gained signif-
icant development in recent years, mainly because of the
breakthrough of deep learning models [45, 58, 20, 23]. In
[45], Wei et al. propose an end-to-end framework based
on the FCN [36] to discover co-salient objects. In addition,
an unsupervised CNN [23] is proposed to jointly optimize
the co-saliency maps. A more comprehensive image co-
saliency method survey can be found in [50].

3. Proposed approach

Figure 2 illustrates the overall framework of the pro-
posed method. First, a mask is learned for each image that
can highlight the co-salient regions and remove the back-
ground in the FCN learning (§ 3.1). Then, the mask-guided
FCN detects the co-salient objects (§ 3.2). Finally, a multi-
scale label smoothing model is proposed to reﬁne the output
of the mask-guided FCN (§ 3.3).

3.1. Mask learning

We leverage the VGG-16 network [40] pre-trained on
the ImageNet image classiﬁcation task [13] by removing
its fully connected layers as generic feature extractor, and
use the convolutional feature maps (CFMs) of the last lay-
er (i.e., conv5-3) for masking learning. Given a group of
images I = {In}N
n=1 that contain co-salient objects of a
category, for each image In ∈ I, the VGG network gener-
ates its feature representation Xn = [xn

where mn = [m(xn

ing the ﬁlters w, supervised learning suffers from high an-
notation cost of labeling foreground masks as training data.
Moreover, the learned model may not work well for unseen
object categories in testing since it cannot be well general-
ized to unseen categories. To address this issue, motivated
by principle component analysis (PCA) [4], we learn the
ﬁlters w in an unsupervised learning manner. However, P-
CA selects the projection direction of maximum variance,
which may lead to strong class overlap. As for our task,
the direction selected by PCA may cause high classiﬁer re-
sponses at all locations, leading to an inaccurate mask (refer

to the middle row in Figure 3). To prevent this issue, we add
an additional sparse regularization on the mask mn, leading
to the following objective function

where ¯X = [¯x, . . . , ¯x]⊤ is composed of the sample set mean

mask responses for all locations to have maximal variance,
the second term leverages l2 norm to control overﬁtting, and
the last term penalizes high responses of mn at background
while making the ﬁrst term encourage mn to have high re-
sponses at foreground, thereby reducing class overlap com-
pared to PCA that only resorts to maximal variance.

The objective L(w) in (2) is convex with respect to the
variables w, and can be minimized to achieve the globally
optimal solution via ADMM [6]. By introducing the step

Note that the proposed objective function (2) is con-
vex, and the ADMM algorithm has closed-form solution for
each subproblem in (5). Therefore, it satisﬁes the Eckstein-
Bertsekas condition [14] that is guaranteed to converge to
global optimum. Moreover, we empirically ﬁnd that the
proposed ADMM can converge within 3 iterations on most
images, and thus we set the iteration number to 3 for efﬁ-
ciency.

After obtaining the optimal mask mn, we reshape it to
the size of the feature map of the conv5-3 layer, and then
use bicubic interpolation to resize it to the desired size of
each masked feature map, yielding a group of masks M =
{Mn}N

n=1 for the input image set I.

and our method (bottom row). PCA yields noisy background re-
sponses while our method can uniformly highlight the foreground
common targets.

Figure 3 shows some examples of masks generated by
our method and PCA. The input images consist of multi-
ple targets such as cat, girl, helmet, baseball, etc, making it
challenging to accurately localize the common baseballs. P-
CA suffers from noisy background, failing to uniformly lo-
calize the common targets. On the contrary, by introducing
sparse representation to suppress the background responses,
the proposed approach enables to better highlight the com-
mon targets than PCA.

3.2. Mask guided FCN

The recently proposed SPP-Net [21] shows that CFMs
encode both the semantics (by strengths of their activations)
and spatial layouts of objects (by their positions), and hence
SPP-Net masks the CFMs by a rectangular region, and di-
rectly pools the masked CFMs for recogniton. Afterwards,
Dai et al. [12] further show that using a ﬁne segment with
an irregular shape to mask the CFMs enables to achieve top-
level performance for semantic segmentation. Motivated by
these works, we further propose the mask-guided FCN that
masks out the CNN features of concurrent patterns across
images for co-saliency detection.

We use the backbone architecture as the FCN proposed
by [36], which consists of 16 convolutional layers inter-
leaved by ReLU non-linearity, 5 max pooling and 2 dropout
layers, and one deconvolutional layer. Given the train-
ing samples {In, Gn}, where Gn is the binary ground-truth
mask of the input image In. In is then fed forward through
the FCN to generate the CFMs F n = {Fn
2 , . . .}. Then,
we mask each feature map Fn
k in F n with the learned mask
Mn introduced by § 3.1

where ⊙ denotes the element-wise multiplication.

As shown in Figure 2 (b), after the conv3 layer, we
achieve two branch features. One is only masking the pool3
layer while the other is only masking the pool5 layer. A-

mong them, the CFMs of pool3 layer mainly encode mid-
level patterns such as triangular structures, red blobs, spe-
ciﬁc textures, etc., which are generic to describe all cate-
gories [19, 43]. Therefore, masking the pool3 layer captures
salient regions of category-agnostic objects and can bet-
ter generalize to unseen categories. In addition, the CFMs
of pool5 layer encode rich high-level semantic information
that is robust to signiﬁcant appearance variations across the
images, and masking these high-level features can further
boost performance, which is veriﬁed by our ablative study
in § 4.4. Then, to make full use of the complementary ad-
vantages of the two branch features, we fuse them by adding
them together to feed forward through the following layer-
s. Finally, we apply a 1 × 1 convolutional layer to com-
pute the saliency map, and apply a deconvolutional layer to
make the output map have the same size as the input im-
age. The output layer is a sigmoid layer, which converts the
saliency score into [0, 1]. For each input image In, the FC-
N ﬁnally outputs a probability map Sn(θ) with θ denoting
the network parameters, and is trained by minimizing the
following loss function

features are not discriminative enough to different object-
s of the same category. As shown in Figure 4, there exist
several geese with different colors, among which only the
white ones are the co-salient targets, but our mask-guided
FCN also mistakenly detects the gray goose distractors as
co-salient targets (see middle row of Figure 4). To address
this issue, we complement the semantic features with pixel-
level and superpixel-level cues, and propose a multi-scale
label smoothing model that alternatively optimizes the two
models with these cues (refer to Figure 5).
Superpixel-level model: Given the input image set I and
its corresponding deep co-saliency map set S, we ﬁrst use
SLIC method [2] to separate each image In ∈ I into a set of
superpixels Y n = {yn
i denotes the mean of
superpixel i in the LAB color space, and ¯n is the number of
superpixels. Then, we transform the deep co-saliency map
n
Sn( ˆθ) ∈ S into an initial indicator vector ¯l
i=1
with ¯ln
i = 1, if the mean of values in superpixel i is larger
than the mean of all values in the deep co-saliency map n,
otherwise, ¯ln
i = 0. We then deﬁne a graph G = (V, E),
where the nodes V = {Y n}N
n=1 are the superpixels on the
image set I and the edges E are weighted by an afﬁnity
matrix W = [wij] ¯N × ¯N with the number of nodes ¯N =

i=1, where yn

where k · kF denotes the Frobenius norm, the last term de-
notes weight decay and λ3 > 0 is a pre-deﬁned trade-off
parameter. Minimizing L(θ) via the stochastic gradient de-
scent (SGD) method yields the optimal solution ˆθ, and the
FCN outputs the deep co-saliency maps for image set {In}
as S = {Sn( ˆθ)}.

(10)
where N (j) is the 8-neighbors of the node j. Given G, it-
s degree matrix D = diag{d11, . . . , d ¯N ¯N }, where dii =

Pj wij . Then, similar to the manifold ranking algorith-

m [59], the optimal ranking is computed by minimizing the
following objective function

3.3. Reﬁnement with multi scale label smoothing

The presented mask-guided FCN uses high-level seman-
tic features for co-saliency detection, which are not only
robust to appearance changes, but also can well tell the
salient objects from cluttered background. However, these

which are initialized by the indicators transformed by the
deep co-saliency maps in S.
Pixel-level model: Let X = {xi ∈ {0, 1}} denote random
variables that are the labels associated with all the pixels in
the set I, and given the superpixel ranking scores R, we
deﬁne an energy functional in a dense CRF form [27]

Epix(X |R) =Xi

ψu(xi) +Xi<j

where the unary term is deﬁned as

ψp(xi, xj),

(12)

Update X : Fixing R, L and putting r in (17) into (13),
minimizing E(R, L, X ) with respect to X is equal to min-
imizing Epix(X |R) that is the objective of dense CRF, and
hence we use the algorithm in [27] to efﬁciently obtain the
optimal solution of X .

Update L: We denote the optimal solution of X as
x = [x1, . . .]⊤, and then use x to mask the deep co-saliency
map vector s, yielding ˆs = x ⊙ s. Then, we reshape and
split ˆs to generate a group of masked deep co-saliency maps
{ ˆSn}N
n=1, which are used to update L by means of generat-
ing the initial indicator vector introduced by the section of
Superpixel-level model.

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce implementation detail-
s of our algorithm (§ 4.1) and then introduce the bench-
mark datasets and evaluation metrics (§ 4.2). Afterwards,
we show the qualitative and quantitative comparison result-
s of our method with the state-of-the-arts (§ 4.3). Finally,
we conduct ablative study to show the effectiveness of each
component in the proposed method (§ 4.4).

4.1. Implementation details

We leverage MSRA-B [34] as the training set to train the
mask-guided FCN, and all training images are resized to
500× 500 pixels. The parameters in our method are set by
experience as λ1 = λ3 = 0.001, λ2 = 100, λ4 = 1, ρ = 10
and β = 0.9. We minimize the objective function (9) using
mini-batch SGD with a batch size of 64, and momentum of
0.99. The learning rate is set to 1e-10, and the weight decay
is set to 0.0005. The iteration number is set to 12,000. The
CNNs are implemented in Caffe [26] and a Titan X GPU is
used for acceleration.

Datasets: We evaluate the proposed algorithm on three
co-saliency benchmark datasets including iCoseg [3], MSR-
C [46] and Cosal2015 [52]. ICoseg has 38 groups of total
643 images, and each group has 4∼42 images. The images
in iCoseg have similar objects with various poses and sizes.
MSRC consists of 8 groups of total 240 images, and the co-
salient object appearances in one group exhibit signiﬁcant
difference, increasing the difﬁculty for co-saliency detec-
tion. Cosal2015 is the largest dataset with 2015 images of
50 categories, and it is also the most challenging dataset
since its images from one group suffer from the challeng-
ing factors such as different colors, sizes, poses, appearance
variations and background clutters, etc.

Evaluation metrics: We compare our approach with the
other state-of-the-art methods in terms of ﬁve criterions in-
cluding the precision-recall (PR) curve, the receive opera-
tor characteristic (ROC) curve, the average precision (AP)

is computed by an adaptive threshold T = µ + ǫ to segmen-
t the co-saliency maps, where µ and ǫ represent the mean
and standard deviation respectively. Here we deﬁne the F-
measure based on the obtained average precision and recall

,

(18)

where β2 is set to 0.3 to enhance the importance of recall as
suggested in [54, 52, 5].

4.3. Comparisons with state of the art methods

We compare our algorithm with 6 state-of-art co-saliency
detection methods including CBCS [15], CSHS [35], ES-
MG [31], CODR [49], CODW [52], and SPMIL [54]. For
fair comparisons, we directly report the results released by
the authors.

Qualitative comparison results: Figure 6 shows some
qualitative comparison results. Among them, it is obvious
that the proposed method can better extract the co-saliency
regions in cases of different colors, poses, appearance vari-
ance and complex background.
In Figure 6, the left two
groups of images are from iCoseg. Among them, in group
of elephant, the grass in the background shares the same
color with the elephants, making the other compared meth-
ods fail to fully detect the elephants, but our method can

achieve satisfying results because it uses the high-level se-
mantic information that can well discriminate target from
background. The middle groups are from MSRC that are
mainly for semantic segmentation, and our method can also
get favorable results under the interface of signiﬁcant ap-
pearance variations. The right groups are from Cosal2015,
and in both groups, our method can better detect the targets
even they suffer from different complex scenes and signiﬁ-
cant appearance changes.

Quantitative comparison results: Figure 7 shows the
PR and ROC curves of the compared methods on three
benchmark datasets. The performance statistics are sum-
marized in Table 1. From Figure 7, we can observe that
our algorithm outperforms the other state-of-the-art meth-
ods in terms of both PR and ROC curves on all bench-
marks. Especially on Cosal2015, the curves generated by
the proposed method are much higher than the other meth-
ods. Furthermore, as listed by Table 1, CODW provides
the best performance on the Cosal2015 among the state-of-
the-arts, with AP score of 0.7437, AUC score of 0.9127,
and Fβ score of 0.7046. Meanwhile, our approach achieves
AP score of 0.8527, AUC score of 0.9578, and Fβ score
of 0.8142, and signiﬁcantly outperforms CODW by 10.9%,
4.51%, and 10.96%, respectively. These results verify the
effectiveness of our mask-guided FCN with multi-scale la-
bel smoothing for co-saliency detection.

4.4. Ablative study

To further verify our main contributions, we compare d-
ifferent variants of our method including those without re-
ﬁnement (-R), pool3 masking (-P3), and pool5 masking (-
P5) respectively.

From Table 1, we can observe that without reﬁnemen-
t, both the AP and Fβ scores drop obviously on all bench-
mark datasets. Especially on the iCoseg, the AP score drops
signiﬁcantly from 0.9057 to 0.8395 by 6.62% while the Fβ
score drops from 0.8553 to 0.8110 by 4.43%. This veri-
ﬁes the effectiveness of our multi-scale reﬁnement strategy
that can signiﬁcantly boost the co-saliency detection accura-
cy. Furthermore, without pool3 masking, most scores of AP,
AUC, and Fβ are lower than those without pool5 masking.
We think this is due to that the pool3 masking can capture
salient regions of category-agnostic objects, leading to bet-

ter generalization to unseen categories. In addition, without
pool5 masking, all three scores drop, verifying the effec-
tiveness of masking high-level semantic features that can
further boost performance.

5. Conclusion

This paper has presented a masked-guided FCN for co-
saliency detection including three cascades: in the ﬁrst cas-
cade, an unsupervised learning method has been proposed
to learn co-salient object masks. In the second cascade, the
learned masks are leveraged to mask the convolutional fea-
ture maps of the FCN for salient object extraction. In the
third cascade, the output of the FCN has been further reﬁned
by iteratively optimizing a novel multi-scale label smooth-
ing model. Extensive evaluations on three benchmarks have
veriﬁed the effectiveness of our method.
