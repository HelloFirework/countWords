Abstract

Systems which incrementally create 3D semantic maps
from image sequences must store and update representa-
tions of both geometry and semantic entities. However,
while there has been much work on the correct formulation
for geometrical estimation, state-of-the-art systems usually
rely on simple semantic representations which store and up-
date independent label estimates for each surface element
(depth pixels, surfels, or voxels). Spatial correlation is dis-
carded, and fused label maps are incoherent and noisy.

We introduce a new compact and optimisable semantic
representation by training a variational auto-encoder that
is conditioned on a colour image. Using this learned latent
space, we can tackle semantic label fusion by jointly opti-
mising the low-dimenional codes associated with each of a
set of overlapping images, producing consistent fused label
maps which preserve spatial correlation. We also show how
this approach can be used within a monocular keyframe
based semantic mapping system where a similar code ap-
proach is used for geometry. The probabilistic formulation
allows a ﬂexible formulation where we can jointly estimate
motion, geometry and semantics in a uniﬁed optimisation.

1. Introduction

Intelligent embodied devices such as robots need to build
and maintain representations of their environments which
permit inference of geometric and semantic properties, such
as the traversability of rooms or the way to grasp objects.
Crucially, if this inference is to be scalable in terms of com-
puting resources, these representations must be efﬁcient;
and if devices are to operate robustly, the employed repre-
sentations must cope with all of the variation present in the
real world. However, current real-time scene understanding
systems are still a long way from the performance needed
for truly ground-breaking applications [5, 9].

An eventual token-like, composable scene understand-

frames from the NYUv2 dataset. Compact representations
of semantics and geometry have been jointly optimised with
camera pose to obtain smooth and consistent estimates.

ing may ﬁnally give artiﬁcial systems the capability to rea-
son about space and shape in the intuitive manner of hu-
mans [37]. Bringing deep learning into traditional hand-
designed estimation methods for SLAM has certainly led
to big advances to representations which can capture both
shape and semantics [6, 36], but so far these are problem-
atic in various ways. The most straightforward approaches,
such as [16, 14, 28, 38, 39, 26] which paint a dense geomet-
ric SLAM map with fused semantic labels predicted from
views [25, 24, 13], are expensive in terms of representation
size; label scenes in an incoherent way where each surface
element independently stores its class; and do not beneﬁt
from semantic labelling improving motion or geometry es-
timation.

At the other end of the scale are approaches which ex-
plicitly recognise object instances and build scene models
as 3D object graphs [27, 35, 30, 31]. These representations
have the token-like character we are looking for, but are
limited to mapping discrete ‘blob-like’ objects from known

classes and leave large fractions of scenes undescribed.

Looking for efﬁcient representations of whole scenes, in
this work we are inspired by CodeSLAM from Bloesch et
al. [3] which used a learned encoding to represent the dense
geometry of a scene with small codes which can be efﬁ-
ciently stored and jointly optimised in multi-view SLAM.
While [3] encoded only geometry, here we show that we
can extend the same conditional variational auto-encoder
(CVAE) to represent the multimodal distributions of se-
mantic segmentation. As in CodeSLAM, our learned low-
dimensional semantic code is especially suitable for, but not
limited to keyframe based semantic mapping systems, and
allows for joint optimisation across multiple views to max-
imise semantic consistency. This joint optimisation allevi-
ates the problems caused by the independence of surface el-
ements assumed by most semantic fusion methods, and al-
lows much higher quality multi-view labellings which pre-
serve whole elements of natural scenes.

We show that compact representations of geometry and
semantics can be jointly learned, resulting in the multitask
CVAE used in this paper. This network makes it possible
to build a monocular dense semantic SLAM system where
geometry, poses and semantics can be jointly optimised.

To summarise, our paper has the following contributions:

• A compact and optimisable representation of semantic
segmentation using an image-conditioned variational
auto-encoder.

• A new multi-view semantic label fusion method opti-

mising semantic consistency.

• A monocular dense semantic 3D reconstruction sys-
tem, where geometry and semantics are tightly coupled
into a joint optimisation framework.

2. Related Work

Structured semantic segmentations of the type we pro-
pose have been studied by several authors. Sohn et al. [33]
proposed a CVAE to learn the distribution of object seg-
mentation labels using Gaussian latent variables. Due to
the learned distribution, the resulting object segmentation
was more robust to noisy and partially observed data com-
pared to discriminative CNN models. Pix2Pix from Isola
et al. [15] used a conditional Generative Adversarial Net-
work (GAN) to achieve image to image translation tasks in
which the conditional distribution of semantic labels is im-
plicitly learned. However, when used for semantic predic-
tion from colour images, the GAN training process induces
hallucinated objects. In addition, the distributions learned
by GANs are not directly accessible and optimisable in the
form we need for multi-view fusion.

Kohl et al. recently proposed a probabilistic U-Net [23]
to address the ambiguities of semantic segmentation due

to insufﬁcient context information. A CVAE was designed
to learn the multimodal distribution of segmentations given
colour images through a low-dimensional latent space, and
it was shown that ambiguities can be well modelled by a
compact latent code. We build on this idea and show that
we can use the learned latent space to integrate multi-view
semantic labels, and build a monocular dense SLAM sys-
tem capable of jointly optimising geometry and semantics.

3. Compact Geometry + Semantics Encoding

Our multitask CVAE (see Figure 2) learns the condi-
tional probability densities for depths and semantic segmen-
tations conditioned on colour images in a manner similar to
the compact representation of geometry in CodeSLAM [3].
The network consists of three main parts: a U-shaped mul-
titask network with skip connections and two variational
auto-encoders for depth and semantic segmentation.

The U-shaped multitask network contains one shared en-
coder with a ResNet-50 backbone [12] and two separate
decoders adopting ReﬁneNet units [24]. Unlike the origi-
nal implementation, batch normalisation is added after each
convolution in the ReﬁneNet unit to stabilise training. Each
of the two variational auto-encoders consists of a VGG-like
fully convolutional recognition model (encoder) followed
by a linear generative model (decoder), which is coupled
with the U-net and thus conditioned on colour images.

More speciﬁcally, in the linear decoder the latent code is
ﬁrst broadcast spatially to have the same height/width and
then 1 × 1 convolved to have the same dimensionality as
the image feature maps from the last ReﬁneNet unit. A
merged tensor is then computed by doing a three-fold con-
catenation of the broadcast/convolved code, the ReﬁneNet
unit, and an element-wise multiplication of the two. Finally,
convolution (without nonlinear activation) and bilinear up-
sampling is applied to obtain the prediction. The motivation
for this procedure is to obtain a linear relationship between
code and prediction which is conditioned on the input im-
age in a nonlinear manner [3] — the linearity enabling pre-
computation of Jacobians during inference at test time (see
Section 4). The predicted depth and semantics (unscaled
logits before softmax function) can thus be formulated as:

D (cd, I) = D0 (I) + Jd (I) cd,
S (cs, I) = S0 (I) + Js (I) cs,

(1)

(2)

where Js/d represents the learned linear inﬂuence, and
D0(I) = D(0, I) and S0(I) = S(0, I). Due to our vari-
ational setup, D0(I) and S0(I) can be interpreted as the
most likely prediction given the input image alone. Note
the generality of this framework, which could be combined
with arbitrary network architectures.

(one-hot encoded) are encoded to two low-dimensional latent codes via VGG-like fully convolutional networks. These
recognition models shown in the dashed boxes are not accessible during inference. The RGB images are processed by a U-
shaped network with a ResNet-50 backbone. Finally, the sub-parts are combined by ⊗ operations standing for a combination
of broadcasting, concatenation, and element-wise multiplication.

3.1. Network Training Conﬁguration

Both the depth and semantic predictions are jointly
trained using groundtruth data.
In addition to the recon-
struction losses discussed in the following sections, the vari-
ational setup requires a KL-divergence based loss on the la-
tent space [21]. In order to avoid a degrading latent space,
we employ a KL annealing strategy [4, 34] where we grad-
ually increase the weights of the KL terms from 0 after 2
training epochs. Finally, the weights of semantic vs. depth
reconstruction losses are trained in an adaptive manner to
account for task-dependent uncertainty [18]. In all of our
experiments, we train the whole network in an end-to-end
manner using the Adam optimiser [20] with an initial learn-
ing rate of 10−4 and a weight decay of 10−4. The ResNet-
50 is initialised using ImageNet pre-trained weights, and all
other weights are initialised using He et al.’s method [11].
For depth images, as in [3], the raw depth values d are
ﬁrst transformed via a hybrid parametrisation called prox-
imity, p = a/(a + d), where a is the average depth value,
which is set to 2m in all of our experiments. In this way, we
can handle raw depth values ranging from 0 to +∞ and as-
sign more precision to regions closer to the camera. An L1
loss function together with data dependent Homoscedastic
uncertainty [17] is used as the reconstruction error:

Lφ,θ (d) =

NXi=1

(cid:20) |epi − pi|

bi

+ log (bi)(cid:21) ,

(3)

where N is the number of pixels,epi and pi are the predicted

proximity and input proximity of the i-th pixel, and bi is the
predicted uncertainty of the ith pixel.

Semantic segmentation labels, which are discrete num-
bers, are one-hot encoded before being input to the network.
Therefore, the multi-class cross-entropy function is a natu-
ral option for calculating the reconstruction loss using the
predicted softmax probabilities and one-hot encoded labels:

4. Fusion via Multi-View Code Optimisation

In a multi-view setup, depth, semantics, and motion es-
timates can be reﬁned based on consistency in overlapping
regions by making use of dense correspondences. While the
use of photometric consistency is well-established, here we
also introduce semantic consistency, i.e. any given part of
our scene should have the same semantic label irrespective
of viewpoint. The semantic consistency is less affected by
disturbances such as non-Lambertian reﬂectance, but may
be subject to quantisation errors and cannot be directly mea-
sured.

Given no additional information, an all-zero code is most
likely code because of the multivariate Gaussian prior as-
sumption during training (Section 3.1). This zero code

11778

can thus be used, both as an initialisation value and as a
prior during optimisation at test time (during which we have
no access to depths or semantic labels). The probabilis-
tic formulation of the system allows it to embed depth, se-
mantics and motion into a uniﬁed probabilistic framework
and thereby combine an arbitrary number of information
sources including images, semantic constraints, priors, mo-
tion models or even measurements from other sensors.

4.1. Geometry Reﬁnement

In analogy to [3], given an image IA with its depth code
cA
d , and a second image IB with estimated relative rigid
body transformation T BA = (RBA, tBA) ∈ SO (3) × R3,
the dense correspondence for each pixel u in view A is:

d , T BA(cid:1) = π(cid:0)T BA π−1 (uA, DA [uA])(cid:1) ,
w(cid:0)uA, cA
functions, respectively. DA stands for DA = D(cid:0)cA

where π and π−1 are the projection and inverse projection

and the square bracket operation [u] means a value look-up
at pixel location u. We can then establish the photometric
error ri based on the photo-consistency assumption [19]:

d , IA(cid:1),

(5)

ri = IA [uA] − IB(cid:2)w(cid:0)uA, cA

d , T BA(cid:1)(cid:3) .

Similarly, we can derive the geometric error term rz as:

(6)

rz = DB[w(uA, cA

d , T BA)] − [T BAπ−1(uA, DA[uA])]Z ,
(7)

where [·]Z refers to the depth value of a point.

Both photometric and geometric errors are differentiable
w.r.t. the input camera poses and latent codes, so that Jaco-
bians can be computed using the chain rule. Due to the de-
signed linear relationship we can pre-compute the Jacobian
of depth prediction w.r.t. the code which is computationally
expensive due to the dense convolution operations.

4.2. Semantics Reﬁnement

Given images IA , IB sharing a common ﬁeld of view
(FOV), and their pre-softmax predictions SA and SB gen-
erated from semantic codes cA
s , we propose to es-
tablish a semantic error term via dense warping:

s and cB

rs = DS(cid:0)SA [uA] , SB(cid:2)w(cid:0)uA, cA

d , T BA(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:1) ,

chosen to be the Euclidean distance after applying softmax
on the logits. Establishing the semantic error on top of se-
mantic labels is not adopted here due to the loss of informa-
tion and the induced non-differentiability.

The underlying intuition of Equation 8 is that corre-
sponding pixels must have the same semantic label, and
thus similar (but not necessary the same) softmax categori-
cal probabilities. Unlike the photo-consistency assumption,

the semantic consistency assumption is comparatively weak
since it is not anchored to any actual measurement, though
this is somewhat alleviated by the zero-code prior described
above. Nevertheless, as the viewpoint varies, different se-
mantic cues may become available and a previously seman-
tically ambiguous region may become more distinctive. In-
stead of fusing this information element-wise [28], the esti-
mates are propagated all the way back to the semantic code,
allowing spatial information fusion.

The semantic error term in Equation 8 is differentiable

the camera pose and depth of the reference keyframe. This
naturally enables semantic information to inﬂuence motion
and structure estimation, i.e., the framework will for in-
stance attempt to align chairs with chairs and walls with
walls. Again, the Jacobians of the semantic logits w.r.t. the
semantic code can be pre-computed.

Although our semantics reﬁnement approach targets a
monocular keyframe based SLAM system, it can be adopted
as a semantic label fusion module in arbitrary SLAM sys-
tem such as stereo or RGB-D SLAM systems.

5. Monocular Dense Semantic SLAM

We can integrate the geometry and semantics reﬁne-
ment processes into a preliminary keyframe based monoc-
ular SLAM system. The map is represented by a collection
of keyframes, each with a camera pose and two latent codes,
one for geometry and one for semantics, as shown in Figure
3. We follow the standard paradigm of dividing the system
into tracking (front-end) and mapping (back-end) and alter-
nate between them [22]. In the present paper, for efﬁciency
reasons, the tracking module estimates the relative 3D mo-
tion between the current frame and the last keyframe using
the photometric residual only [2].

The mapping module relies on dense N-frame structure

6.1. Datasets

NYUv2 has 1,449 pre-aligned and annotated images
(795 in the training set and 654 in the test set). We cropped
all the available images from 640 × 480 to valid regions of
560 × 425 before further processing. The 13 class semantic
segmentation task is evaluated in our experiments.

Stanford 2D-3D-Semantic is a large scale real world
dataset with a different set of 13 semantic class deﬁnitions.
70,496 images with random camera parameters are split into
a training set of 66,792 images (areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) and a test
set of 3,704 images (area 3). We rectiﬁed all images to a
uniﬁed camera model.

The synthetic SceneNet RGB-D dataset provides perfect
ground truth annotations for 5M images. We use a subset:
our training set consists of 110,000 images by sampling ev-
ery 30th frame of each sequence from the ﬁrst 11 original
training splits. Our test dataset consists of 3,000 images by
sampling every 100th frame from the original validation set.
All input images are resized to 256 ×192. During train-
ing, we use data augmentation including random horizon-
tal ﬂipping and jittering of brightness and contrast. At test
time, only single scale semantic prediction is evaluated.

6.2. Image Conditioned Scene Representation

We ﬁrst quantitively inspect the inﬂuence of code size
on the NYUv2 and SceneNet RGB-D datasets by measur-
ing reconstruction performance. We use the same latent
code size for depth images and semantic labels for simplic-
ity. We also train a discriminative ReﬁneNet for seman-
tic segmentation and depth estimation separately as a sin-
gle task prediction-only baseline models (i.e. code size of
0). Figure 4 shows results for depth and semantic encod-
ing with different code size and setups. The reconstruction
performance indicates the capacity of the latent encoding
for variational auto-encoders. Due to the encoded infor-
mation, the reconstruction is consistently better than single
view monocular prediction. Furthermore, we do not bene-
ﬁt from a non-linear decoder and we observe diminishing
returns when the code size is larger than 32, and therefore
choose this for later experiments.

The qualitative effects of our image conditioned auto-
encoding of size 32 are shown in Figure 5. The zero-code
predictions are usually similar to the encoded predictions,
though errors in ambiguous regions are corrected given
the additional encoded information. Figure 6 displays the
learned image dependent Jacobians of the semantic logits
w.r.t. entries in the code. We see how each code entry is re-
sponsible for certain semantically meaningful regions (e.g.
examine the sofa Jacobians). Additionally, each code entry
also has a tendency to decrease the probability of other am-
biguous classes. For two images from different viewpoints,
the image dependent Jacobians show high consistency.

mance of different set-ups on the NYUv2 and SceneNet
RGB-D test sets. Reconstruction performance increases
with code size. The quality of zero-code predictions is com-
parable to a discriminative ReﬁneNet model for semantic
segmentation, and better on depth prediction. Using a non-
linear decoder leads to little improvement.

from motion, by minimising photometric, geometric and se-
mantic residuals with a zero-code prior between any two
overlapping frames, which can be formulated as a non-
linear least-square problem. As in CodeSLAM [3], we em-
ploy loss functions that (i) remove invalid correspondences,
(ii) perform relative weighting for different residuals, (iii)
include robust Huber weighting, (iv) down-weight strongly
slanted and potentially occluded pixels. The differentiable
residuals are minimised by a damped Gauss-Newton. In ad-
dition, the linear decoder allows us to pre-compute the Ja-
cobians of the network prediction w.r.t. the code for each
keyframe. Because the semantic residual relies not only
on the semantic code but also on data association, during
mapping we ﬁrst jointly optimise the geometry and poses,
then optimise the semantic residual, and lastly jointly opti-
mise both geometry and semantics. In this way, we tightly
couple geometry and semantics into a single optimisation
framework.

images are at the top. We show ground truth, encoded predictions (code from encoder) and zero-code predictions (monocular
predictions) for depth and semantic labels. Incorrect semantic predictions in regions which are ambiguous for monocular
predictions are corrected by optimising the compact latent codes. Black regions are masked unknown classes.

Figure 6: The Jacobians of semantic logits w.r.t. two code entries for a pair of wide baseline views. The columns represent the
inﬂuence of the code entry across each semantic classes. Red and blue mean positive and negative inﬂuence, respectively. Se-
mantically meaningful regions can be reﬁned coherently during optimisation, leading to smooth and complete segmentation,
and this property is automatically carried over into the semantic fusion process.

6.3. Semantic Label Fusion using Learned Codes

Our semantic reﬁnement process can be regarded as a
label fusion scheme for multi-view semantic mapping. An
important advantage of code based fusion compared to the
usual element-wise update methods for label fusion is its
ability to naturally obtain spatially and temporally consis-

tent semantic labels by performing joint estimation in the
latent space. This means that pixels are not assumed i.i.d
when their semantic probabilities are updated, leading to
smoother and more complete label regions.

To isolate only label estimation, our experiments use the
SceneNet RGB-D dataset where precise ground truth depth
and camera poses are available to enable perfect data as-

sociation. We also mask out and ignore occluded regions.
We use the zero-code monocular predictions as the initial
semantic predictions for all fusion methods.

In Figure 7 we show the result of semantic label fusion
given two views taken with a large baseline. The RHS zero-
code prediction struggles to recognise the table given the
ambiguous context. The high entropy indicates that se-
mantic labels are likely to change during optimisation. In
contrast, the LHS zero-code prediction is able to accurately
segment the table with relatively low entropy. By minimis-

ing the semantic cost between two views, the optimised se-
mantic representations are able to generate a consistent pre-
dictions, successfully leading to the disambiguation of the
RHS into a well segmented and smooth prediction. The en-
tropy of both views are reduced as well. Similar improve-
ments can also be observed in other regions. In addition, it
is interesting to observe that the entropy map exhibits con-
sistency with the scene structure, showing that the network
can recognise the spatial extent of an object but struggles
with the precise semantic class.

Qualitative results of different label fusion methods are
shown in Figure 8. The results of both element-wise fusion
approaches are obtained by integrating the probabilities of
the other images into each current frame, while our result
simply comes from pairing all the later frames to the ﬁrst
frame. For a sequence of 5 frames with small baselines,
the zero-code predictions are all similar. As a result, when
there is a difﬁcult, ambiguous region (indicated by low qual-
ity zero-code predictions and high entropy), the element-
wise label fusion methods lead to results which are only
marginally better. However, the representation power in the
learned compact code enables much smoother predictions
with correct labels to be obtained through optimisation. Af-
ter optimisation, the reduced entropy for these regions indi-
cates that the network is much more conﬁdent.

Next we provide a quantitative comparison. 2000 im-
ages sampled from 1000 sequences (2 images per sequence)
from the SceneNet RGB-D validation set are used to eval-
uate the performance. We augment every extracted image
with a variable number of subsequent images in the se-
quence to obtain short multi-view sequences (1-4 frames).
Since the trajectories of SceneNet RGB-D are randomly
generated, a good variety of relative transformations and
baselines are included in this set (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the effectiveness of three multi-view label
fusion methods given various number of views. Our label
fusion approach using code optimisation outperforms oth-
ers methods. The improvement in total pixel accuracy is not
signiﬁcant because of the large area of walls and ﬂoors in
the dataset. However, the large improvement in the mIoU
metric shows that our method is able to consider more on
high-order statistics, indicating smoother predictions and
better results on other small objects.

Effect of Code Prior during Semantic Optimisation

During semantic optimisation we use a zero-code regular-
isation term. Without this term, the optimisation may be
drawn to locally consistent but incorrect semantic labels.
Table 2 shows that the accuracy of two-view label fusion
without a zero-code prior is even lower than single view
prediction, underlining the importance of this prior.

Table 2: The effectiveness of different label fusion methods
on 2000 images sampled from SceneNet RGB-D. The large
improvement on the metric of intersection over union shows
that our label fusion lead to smoother predictions.

methods. 5 consecutive frames with a small baseline are
chosen. Our method can effectively fuse multi-view seman-
tic labels to generate smoother semantic predictions.

6.4. Monocular Dense Semantic SLAM

We present example results from our preliminary full
monocular dense semantic SLAM system. Due to the prior
information of geometry encoded in the system, the sys-
tem is very robust during initialisation and can manage pure
rotational motion. The system currently runs in a sliding
window manner. Figures 1 and 9 show examples of two-
view dense semantic structure from motion from different

Figure 9: Qualitative results of two-view structure from mo-
tion on two selected frames from Stanford dataset (ﬁrst 3
rows) and SceneNet RGB-D dataset (last row). The com-
pact representations of both semantics and geometry are
(jointly) optimised with came pose to obtain a dense map
with consistent semantic labels and relative camera motion.

datasets.

7. Conclusion and Future Work

We have shown that an image-conditioned learned com-
pact representation can coherently and efﬁciently represent
semantic labels. This code can be optimised across multi-
ple overlapping views to implement semantic fusion with
many advantages over the usual methods which operate
in a per-surface-element independent manner. As well as
proving this fusion capability experimentally, we have built
and demonstrated a prototype full dense, semantic monocu-
lar SLAM system based on learned codes where geometry,
poses and semantics can all be jointly optimised.

In future work, we aim to unify learned geometric and
semantic representations still further as we continue to
reach towards scene models with optimal representational
efﬁciency for truly useful real-time Spatial AI systems.
