Abstract

Convolutional Neural Network based approaches for
monocular 3D human pose estimation usually require a
large amount of training images with 3D pose annotations.
While it is feasible to provide 2D joint annotations for large
corpora of in-the-wild images with humans, providing ac-
curate 3D annotations to such in-the-wild corpora is hardly
feasible in practice. Most existing 3D labelled data sets are
either synthetically created or feature in-studio images. 3D
pose estimation algorithms trained on such data often have
limited ability to generalize to real world scene diversity.
We therefore propose a new deep learning based method for
monocular 3D human pose estimation that shows high ac-
curacy and generalizes better to in-the-wild scenes. It has
a network architecture that comprises a new disentangled
hidden space encoding of explicit 2D and 3D features, and
uses supervision by a new learned projection model from
predicted 3D pose. Our algorithm can be jointly trained
on image data with 3D labels and image data with only 2D
labels. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging
in-the-wild data.

1. Introduction

Human motion capture has a wide range of applications
in computer animation and also other areas such as biome-
chanics, medicine, and human-computer interaction. How-
ever, the standard 3D human motion capture systems typi-
cally require marker suits and/or multiple cameras record-
ing in a controlled setting which are expensive and compli-
cated to set up, and are impractical outside of the lab or stu-
dio environments. Methods that infer 3D pose only from
monocular images overcome many such limitations and
make 3D pose estimation more widely applicable. How-
ever, due to the under-constrained nature of monocular 3D
pose estimation, achieving accurate 3D prediction is still a
challenging task.

Recent progress of Convolutional Neural Networks

(CNN) [17] has enabled promising learning-based methods
for 3D human pose estimation from a single color image.
Training such methods typically requires a large amount of
RGB images annotated with reference 3D poses from either
marker-based or markerless multi-camera motion capture
systems [31, 8, 28, 15], synthetic data [6], or IMU-based
systems [10, 38, 37]. Owing to this complex reference data
capturing, diversity in real world appearance or pose is hard
to achieve in training data, which limits the generalization
of trained networks on in-the-wild scenes.

To improve in-the-wild generalization, previous work
has leveraged features learned on in-the-wild annotated 2D
pose data. Some methods [21, 22] proposed to ﬁnetune this
learned representation on 3D pose prediction using 3D pose
datasets captured in a studio. Others [43] use this learned
representation as an initialization to jointly predict both 2D
key points and depth information. For images where the 3D
annotations are available, both 2D keypoints and depth are
supervised, with supervision coming from geometric con-
straints otherwise. In this way, networks carry over features
useful for in-the-wild 2D for better 3D pose estimation in
out-of-studio settings.

Using a strong pre-existing pose prior, like a parametric
body model, can also help a network to predict more accu-
rate 3D poses if labelled 3D training data is scarce [41, 16].
Since 3D pose labels on general scene images are hard to
obtain while larger annotated 2D training corpora exist, sev-
eral deep learning based methods resort to using 2D pose as
the target prediction, followed by an additional 3D pose lift-

110905

ing step [11, 39, 42, 2, 34, 5, 20]. Using such, [20] showed
that 2D pose data alone is enough to train a network that
achieves promising 3D pose estimation accuracy. However,
solely predicting 3D from 2D pose is an inherently ambigu-
ous task and in these approaches important 3D pose cues
from the image are neglected.

In this paper, we introduce a new convolutional neural
network architecture for 3D pose estimation that achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging in-the-wild data. It
introduces two main innovations that enable us to effec-
tively train the network using both, more scarcely available
image data with 3D annotation and more easy to generate
image data with only 2D annotation.

The ﬁrst innovation is inspired by 2D-to-3D pose lift-
ing [20], but maintains the network’s capability to explic-
itly utilize 3D cues in images. To this end, we design some
channels of the convolutional latent space to encode ex-
plicit 2D keypoint features in heatmaps, leaving the rest
of the features to contain “depth” information about the
human pose. Separating the 2D and depth, and supervis-
ing 2D with additional in-the-wild data, which has been
the primary driver of accurate 2D pose estimation methods
[40, 23, 4], allows the network to consequently predict 3D
pose more reliably even under a signiﬁcant shift of the input
appearance between the training and testing time. These 2D
pose features can be trained jointly with depth features on
data with 3D annotations, or trained independently on data
with 2D annotations, while in both cases improving overall
network performance.

The second innovation is a supervision approach that re-
duces 3D-to-2D ambiguity when training on data with 2D
annotations only. To this end, we design a neural network
that learns how to estimate the location of 2D body joints
by using the 3D human pose predicted from the earlier net-
work layers as latent features. More speciﬁcally, we learn
to predict the weak perspective camera parameters of the
given monocular image input that project the predicted 3D
pose to the 2D space. During training, this projection loss
can be used to update the information of 3D joint positions
regardless if the training image has 3D labels or only 2D
labels.

Our approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of
70.4% 3D PCK on the MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark with
challenging outdoor scenes, even when trained only using
images with 3D pose labels from the H3.6M [12] studio
dataset. When jointly training on larger corpora of in-studio
images with 3D labels and in-the-wild data with 2D labels,
we achieve 91.3% 3D PCK on MPI-INF-3DHP which out-
performs all previous methods.

2. Related Work

Human pose estimation is an actively studied area in
computer vision. We focus our discussion on recent

learning-based approaches that are relevant to our work.
3D pose from 2D keypoint detection. Due to the robust-
ness of some recent CNN-based 2D pose detection methods
[36, 35, 40, 23, 4], many 3D pose estimation method refor-
mulate the task as a combination of 2D keypoints predic-
tion and body depth regression. Mehta et al. [22] combine
2D heatmap prediction with 3D location maps to estimate
the position of each joint in the 3D space. Zhou et al. [43]
propose a weak supervision training scheme using a stacked
hourglass network [23] on both in-the-wild 2D data and stu-
dio data with 3D labels. The network is trained to predict
2D pose on both studio and outdoor dataset and at the same
time also learns to predict depth information from the 3D
labeled data. Yang et al. [41] also use similar weak supervi-
sion, but they extend this idea by introducing an adversarial
network that learns how to differentiate between a ground
truth and a predicted pose generated by the 3D pose predic-
tion network. Another similar line of work is proposed by
Dabral et al. [7] which improves this approach further by
using body symmetry constraints and a separate temporal
prediction network to achieve better 3D prediction stability
across sequential frames.

To take the full advantage of the detection-based method,
Pavlakos et al. [26] proposed using a volumetric represen-
tation as an extension of the 2D joint heatmaps in the 3D
space. However, this formulation is computationally expen-
sive to perform even after using their coarse-to-ﬁne strategy
proposed to mitigate this issue.
Direct 3D pose prediction. Instead of using the combina-
tion of 2D and depth prediction, several works regress 3D
body keypoints directly. Tekin et al. [33] enhance a direct
3D prediction network by learning human body structure
using a pose autoencoder.

Mehta et al. [21] use multiple intermediate supervision
tasks, such as predicting the output at multiple network lev-
els and predicting 2D heatmaps as an additional objective.
They use two step training approach to improve general-
ization. The network is ﬁrstly trained to learn 2D joint
heatmaps and then reﬁned on the task of directly predict-
ing 3D joint location maps from 3D annotated studio data.
Instead of directly predicting the keypoints, [44] regresses
the joint angles on a kinematic body model, assuming that
the bonelength of the subject is known. Sun et al. [32] use a
geometry aware formulation that also predicts bone length
and bone vector orientation instead of only regressing 3D
keypoint locations.

Rhodin et al. [30] proposed a multi-view consistent pre-
diction approach during training to reﬁne neural network’s
monocular pose prediction on general scenes. But it re-
quires synchronized multi-camera footage to train. Multi-
view settings can also be used to perform unsupervised or
semisupervised learning on human pose estimation by train-
ing the network to learn a geometry aware latent space that

Figure 2: The overview of our proposed architecture. We use a CNN fRGB to learn 3D pose features represented as 2D
heatmap locations h2D and additional 3D pose cues d in the latent space. Both information are used to predict a root
centered 3D pose p3D and viewpoint parameters c using networks f3D and fc, respectively. Finally, we concatenate p3D
and c to learn 2D keypoint information h2D, allowing the network to update 3D pose information even if 3D labels are not
available.

can generate novel view on different cameras [29].

3D lifting without depth information. Some methods
compute 3D pose by estimating the depth from the detected
2D keypoints only. Tome et al. [34] performs a sequence of
3D lifting and reprojection to iteratively improve prediction
quality. Chen et al. [5] ﬁnd a closest 3D pose from a library
of human poses that best matches the detected 2D pose. [20]
use a fully connected neural network with residual connec-
tion can achieve accurate 3D pose estimation performance
using 2D ground truth or a very accurate 2D keypoint de-
tection as input. Regardless, these approaches cannot over-
come the principled ambiguity that there are many possible
3D body pose that can be correctly projected into the cor-
responding 2D pose. To reduce this ambiguity of 3D lifting
from 2D estimates, Pavlakos et al. [25] use ordinal depth
annotation between joint pairs, which is a special case of
posebits introduced by Pons-Moll et al. [27].

Estimating 3D pose using 2D projection information.
Bogo et al. [2] ﬁt the 2D keypoints projection of the para-
metric SMPL [18] body model to 2D predictions from a
separate method using an optimization approach. Brau et
al. [3] demonstrated that 2D projection, body pose prior,
and body part length information can be used as the training
loss objectives for 3D pose prediction. Our method extends
the idea of [3] by introducing additional 3D supervision and
paired training on in-the-wild dataset. Kanazawa et al. [16]
showed that pose and shape parameters of the SMPL body
model from monocular images can be learned using a neu-
ral network. While their method uses a 2D projection loss
of the body model as the main objective, their method also
requires an adversarial regularizer against parametric body
models. This method can be further improved by using ad-

ditional labels of 3D pose and SMPL parameters if avail-
able. Omran et al. [24] proposed another deep learning ap-
proach to infer the parameters of the SMPL body model,
and analyzed performance when varying the input represen-
tation (silhouettes, 2D keypoints, part segmentations) and
the proportion of 2D and 3D data. Our approach outper-
forms these methods on several benchmark data sets.

The above review shows that many methods tackle gen-
eralizability on the in-the-wild images using either transfer
learning from 2D pose task, or by decoupling the 3D pose
estimation into separate 2D keypoint detection and depth re-
gression problems. For methods that decouple the 3D rep-
resentation [43, 41, 7], depth information is predicted if 3D
labels are available and otherwise some weak supervision
constraints (e.g. a parametric body model) are used for reg-
ularization. In this paper, we propose a new architecture that
combines explicit encoding of separate 2D and 3D depth
features in hidden space, instead of operating on vectorized
2D predictions as in previous lifting schemes. Our trained
projection network further stabilizes overall 3D prediction
accuracy.

3. Approach

The method estimates the root (pelvis) relative 3D lo-
cations of K human body joints P = {J1, . . . , JK} in the
camera reference frame from a monocular RGB image. Our
method assumes that a crop around the subject is available.
A baseline strategy for our goal would be as fol-
lows: Given a training set consisting of pairs of RGB
images and their corresponding 3D pose labels D =
{(In, PGT
n=1, we could train a convolution-based neu-
ral network fRGB(In, θ) to predict a vectorized represen-

By training on currently available image data sets with
3D pose annotation, such direct supervision approach can
already enable the network to achieve reasonable perfor-
mance on studio test images. However, such a baseline
method is still constrained in its ability to generalize to in-
the-wild scenes due to the limited amount of available real
world images with ground truth 3D poses.

We therefore introduce several strategies to augment
such a 3D pose network such that it performs better on in-
the-wild scenes. Our augmented network can be trained on
both, images with 3D labels and in-the-wild images with
only 2D labels. First, using an explicit 2D pose represen-
tation in the feature space of the CNN combined with 2D
pre-training can signiﬁcantly boost the quality of the predic-
tion. Second, we propose additional supervision by using a
trained projection sub-network that learns weak perspective
camera information for projecting 3D pose estimates to the
2D image space. The overview of our network is shown in
Figure 2.

3.1. Explicit 2D feature representation for 3D pose

prediction

Martinez et al. [20] showed that a simple neural network
is capable of directly regressing 3D human pose with good
accuracy by using only vectorized 2D pose as input. This
shows that a neural network is able to estimate the structure
of natural 3D human pose from corresponding 2D informa-
tion to some extent. However, such a lifting scheme can
only remedy to some extent the fundamental ambiguity that
multiple 3D poses can look the same in 2D. [25] showed
that additional weak ordinal depth supervision can partially
resolve the ambiguity of the problem.

We argue that a 2D-to-3D lifting approach can also be
applied on 2D heatmap input instead of the vectorized 2D
pose representation. From this observation, we decided to
design the convolutional features of our CNN to explicitly
encode 2D pose heatmap information. The idea behind this
decision is to explicitly decouple 2D pose information from
other learned features in the convolutional latent space. The
rest of the feature maps can be used by the network to cap-
ture other image information related to 3D human pose,
such as 3D depth. In this way, the network is guided to learn
3D pose features that are more reliable due to the robust 2D
pose prediction and easier to interpret. Furthermore, by us-
ing a 2D training loss on this component we allow network
to learn useful features from images when 3D pose labels
are not available.

To this end, we design a convolutional feature map
F3D = [h2D, d] after the extractor network fRGB. This
feature map consists of 64 output channels with a spatial di-
mension of 16 × 16. We use the ﬁrst 14 channels to capture
the 2D pose information. We optimize this region during
training by minimizing the loss compared to the 2D ground
truth heatmap in a least square sense. The rest of the feature
channels d are not directly constrained by any explicit loss
and will be supervised through the 3D pose, 2D projection,
as well as additional pose constraints losses explained later.
To infer 3D pose from F3D, we ﬁrst combine explicit
2D heatmaps h2D and the additional features d learned by
the convolutional encoder by using a simple fully connected
layer into a latent vector z ∈ R1024. Then, a fully connected
network with residual connections f3D is used to learn the
vectorized 3D pose representation p3D. We design f3D to
be similar to the lifting architecture in [20]. More speciﬁ-
cally, we use a series consisting of four fully connected lay-
ers with the width of 1024 and ReLU activations. A residual
connection is also incorporated to connect z with the output
of the second layer of f3D.
Bone loss Several earlier works reported that detection-
based approaches using a heatmap or volumetric represen-
tation tend to achieve better performance on both 2D and
3D pose estimation tasks than approaches regressing vec-
torized predictions. However, additional structure aware su-
pervision can lift performance of vectorized prediction to a
competitive level [32]. Since our method also performs vec-
torized 3D pose prediction, we complement the 3D train-
ing loss L3Dpose (equation 1) with a bone supervision loss
Lbone. For 3D training data, Lbone measures the similarity
of the vector between a joint Jk to its corresponding parent
in the kinematic chain to ground truth. For 2D data, it mea-
sures the difference of scalar bone lengths to ground truth.

3.2. Predicting 2D projection from 3D pose

To further improve our method’s ability to utilize 2D
pose data for training 3D pose prediction, we train a sub-
network to project the predicted 3D pose to the image space.
Our camera network fc predicts the principal coordinate
(cx, cy) and the focal length (αx, αy) parameters of a weak
perspective camera model from the given input image. By
using the features extracted from the latent representation z,
we use a multi-layer perceptron to infer the camera param-
eters c ∈ R4. During training, a 2D loss L2Dpose measures
the L2 distance between ground truth 2D pose and 2D pro-
jection p2D of the predicted 3D pose:

p2D = (cid:20)πx(p3D)

αyp3D(y) + cy(cid:21)
πy(p3D)(cid:21) = (cid:20)αxp3D(x) + cx

(2)

Our projection formulation allows the network to learn par-
tial information about the 3D pose even when only 2D pose
annotations are available. However, there are no constraints

410908

that guarantee the correctness of the predicted depth infor-
mation. To regularize 3D pose prediction when training on
2D data, we use the additional bone loss Lbone enforcing
bone length similarity to ground truth for additional super-
vision. We randomly pick the bone length of one of the
training subjects as the ground truth for every training in-
stance.

3.3. Network design

We use an adapted ResNet-50 [9] as the basis of the
backbone subnetwork fRGB (Figure 2) that extracts pose
features from 2D images. This offers a good trade-off be-
tween prediction accuracy and inference time, allowing our
network to be optionally used in real-time applications. The
original ResNet-50 architecture is used up to level Res4f
and we train level Res5a from scratch without striding while
also reducing its number of output channels to 1024. This
extractor network is then followed by the 3D pose regressor
network described in 3.1.

The studio datasets with 3D labels and the outdoor data
sets with 2D labels which we train on tend to have slightly
differing image statistics due to contrast differences, as well
as foreground background augmentations on the 3D data
sets. To further mitigate this residual domain gap beyond
what our new network architecture can already do by its de-
sign, we employ a similar pre-training approach as several
earlier 3D pose prediction methods, e.g. [21]. To this end,
we ﬁrst pre-train our ResNet-50 network on ImageNet fea-
tures to perform 2D heatmap prediction only. Here, inter-
mediate 2D pose supervision is used on the ﬁrst 14 channels
of the res4d and res5a feature maps. The same intermediate
supervision is also used later when ﬁnetuning the complete
network on both 2D and 3D pose data. After pre-training,
ﬁnal training of the full network on both outdoor images
with 2D annotations and studio images with 3D annotations
results in learned features that generalize well to in-the-wild
scenes and yield high accuracy in 3D pose estimation.

Our algorithm can be modiﬁed to handle input images
of arbitrary framing around the human, because our subnet-
work fRGB is convolutional. For example, we can perform
tight bounding box cropping around the detected 2D key-
points before passing the rescaled image into the subsequent
sub-network.

4. Experiments and Discussion

After discussing datasets and network training we will
show the high performance of our method qualitatively and
quantitatively. We use the H3.6M data set [12] to com-
pare general 3D pose estimation accuracy on in-studio data,
and show that we outperform previous methods on the more
general MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark set. The latter features
more diverse motions, and more diverse scenes, including
indoor scenes with green screen background (GS), as well

outperform all other methods that use a similar combined
2D and 3D training on this benchmark with both indoor and
in-the-wild scenes. This holds true for all evaluation proto-
cols (unscaled (US), glob. scaled (GS), Procrustes (PA)).

as more in-the-wild scenes with general backgrounds, both
indoors (No GS) and outdoors (Outdoor). An ablation
analysis shows the signiﬁcance of the individual compo-
nents in the proposed approach. The supplementary doc-
ument contains further explanations and evaluations.

4.1. Datasets and evaluation metrics

As training data with ground truth 3D pose, we use a
combination of the H3.6M training set, as well as both
background augmented and unaugmented MPI-INF-3DHP
training sets which consist of 350k training images in total.
As in-the-wild training images with only 2D pose annota-
tion we use the MPII [1] and LSP [13] [14] datasets which
are augmented by randomly cropping, translating and rotat-
ing the images.

At test time, we compare against other previously pro-
posed methods on both standard H3.6M and MPI-INF-
3DHP test data to show both general 3D pose prediction ac-
curacy, as well as state-of-the-art generalization on outdoor
scenes. We also qualitatively visualize the state-of-the-art
accuracy of our algorithm on in-the-wild images (see Fig-
ure 3).

The quantitative performance is evaluated by compar-
ing the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), the Per-
centage of Correct 3D Keypoints (3D PCK) under 150 mm
radius [21], as well as the Area Under Curve (AUC) met-
ric which corresponds to the thresholds of the 3D PCK.
Since evaluation protocols in previous work are not uni-
form, we quantitatively evaluate under the three most com-
monly used protocols: (i) 3D joint predictions are neither
scaled nor aligned to ground truth (unscaled), (ii) 3D joint
predictions are globally scaled with ground truth scale be-
fore evaluation (glob. scaled), and (iii) 3D joint predictions
are aligned to ground truth with full Procrustes alignment
(Procrustes). We further follow standard practice by crop-

ping a tight bounding box in test images using 2D ground
truth information. Since cropping essentially performs a
virtual rotation from the original camera, we use perspec-
tive correction [21] to re-align the pose to the correct view.

4.2. Training procedure

As outlined earlier, we train our network in two stages.
We ﬁrst pre-train the feature extractor network on the 2D
heatmap regression task on both MPII [1] and LSP [14, 13]
datasets. At this stage, the network is trained for 186k iter-
ations with a minibatch size of 21. The initial learning rate
is 0.05 which we decay exponentially.

After pre-training, we use the learned weights to initial-
ize the weights of the full 3D pose prediction network. The
full network is then trained on both the 3D labeled studio
data as well as the in-the-wild data with only 2D annota-
tions. Image data with 3D and 2D annotations are both fed
into the network with a minibatch size of 10 to train for
240k iterations. For this second stage, we again start the
training using a learning rate of 0.05 with a decay over 60k
iterations. We use Adadelta with a momentum of 0.9 in both
training stages.

We empirically found that using learning rate discrep-
ancy on the pre-trained layers to preserve in-the-wild fea-
tures, as suggested by [21], is necessary to achieve good
generalization if 3D training data is very limited or more
biased. We found that a learning rate discrepancy with a
factor of 100 when training using H3.6M data as the only

source of 3D pose labels yields the best result when tested
on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset. On the other hand, the best
performance is achieved without using any such discrepan-
cies when training on both H3.6M and the augmented data
of MPI-INF-3DHP as source of 3D labels. This suggest that
foreground and background augmentation of the 3D data
can further close the domain gap between the indoor and
outdoor scenes.

4.3. Quantitative comparison

Table 1 compares our method on the MPI-INF-3DHP
benchmark against the closest competing approaches that
can be trained on both, images with 2D and 3D annota-
tions. All methods were trained using both H3.6M and
augmented and unaugmented MPI-INF-3DHP 3D datasets,
and the LSP and MPII 2D datasets. Unless stated oth-
erwise, we used the H80K samples of the H3.6M dataset
which consists of around 41K training samples before aug-
mentation. Our algorithm achieves by far the highest ac-
curacy (across all evaluation protocols), yielding 82.0% 3D
PCK, 44.7% AUC and 91.0 mm MPJPE overall (using glob.
scaled for evaluation). We also achieve the state-of-the-
art result speciﬁcally on the outdoor scenes with 74.8% 3D
PCK. Further, the average 3D PCK of 91.3% is the highest
ever reported by all algorithms that evaluated on the MPI-
INF-3DHP, irrespective of what training data they used. Ta-
ble 4 further shows the comparison of our approach to other
methods on MPI-INF-3DHP, when all methods are trained

using only H3.6M as the source of 3D pose labels. Also
here, our method achieves the highest accuracy in terms of
3D PCK and AUC on the basis of all three evaluation pro-
tocols.

Finally, we also compare our method by only using the
H80K samples of H3.6M as the 3D pose dataset and testing
on every 64th frame of the S9 and S11 subjects in H3.6M,
see Table 2 (we use glob. scaled following [43][41][7]) and
Table 3 (Procrustes). On this test set which is heavily bi-
ased to in-studio data of a single background our method
geared for in-the wild generalization cannot beat the best
performing methods. However, it still achieves competi-
tive accuracy. When we increased the number of training
data by sampling from H3.6M at 5 frames per second, our

method achieved a better MPJPE of 65.7 mm while main-
taining competitive result when tested on MPI-INF-3DHP
with 71.2% 3D PCK and 36.3% AUC. When using Pro-
crustes during comparison, we achieve a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 53.4 mm average MPJPE when trained using
H80K samples and 49.2 mm average MPJPE when trained
using H3.6M data sampled at 5 fps. Notably, here we also
outperform other methods that use some form of pose pro-
jection operation related to our architecture and regulariza-
tion with a statistical body model, namely [16] and [24].

4.4. Ablation study

We run an ablation study to measure the effectiveness of
our proposed contributions (Table 5). We use a direct 3D
pose regression method with 2D pose pre-training without
the explicit 2D pose loss in the feature space and without
the 2D-from-3D projection loss as baseline. The baseline
is trained on 3D data only and uses both joint position and
bone losses as training objective. We train all of the compar-
ison results on the H80K samples of H3.6M and then per-
formed the evaluation tests on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset.

The baseline reaches 62.3% 3D PCK. Using the explicit
2D pose in the latent feature space allows us to use the
outdoor data during the training. This addition improves
the performance by 3.1% against the baseline. Similarly,
adding the 3D-to-2D projection loss improves the perfor-
mance of the method even without the explicit 2D pose in
latent feature space. Using both the proposed components
advances the result to the state-of-the-art result with 70.4%
3D PCK.

4.5. Qualitative results and further discussion

We visualize example prediction results on MPI-INF-
3DHP and LSP test images in Figure 3. Our method per-
forms consistently well on studio, general indoor and in-
the-wild images.

We show several failure cases in Figure 4. Our method
can fail on challenging poses which are heavily (self-) oc-
cluded, on poses seen from unusual camera angles, or poses
which are from what was seen in the training set. Such fail-
ure cases are common to many monocular 3D pose estima-
tion approaches. The supplementary document shows addi-
tional failure examples of our method.

Table 5: Ablation study on MPI-INF-3DHP test data (split
into scene sub-categories: in-studio with green screen (GS),
and more in-the-wild scenes indoors (No GS) and outdoors
(Outdoor)). Only H3.6M data with ground truth 3D labels
were used for training. 3D predictions are globally scaled.

5. Conclusion

We proposed a new deep learning architecture for 3D
human pose estimation from monocular color images. It is
designed for training on both, more scarcely available real
images with ground truth 3D pose labels, and more widely
available in-the-wild images with only 2D pose labels. Our
architecture augments a backbone 3D pose inference net-
work with an explicit disentangled 2D pose representation
in latent feature space and a learned 3D-to-2D projection
model. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the in-studio H3.6M dataset and clearly outperforms re-
lated work on the more challenging MPI-INF-3DHP bench-
mark with in-the-wild images.
