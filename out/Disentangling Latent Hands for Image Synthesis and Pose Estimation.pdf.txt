Abstract

Hand image synthesis and pose estimation from RGB im-
ages are both highly challenging tasks due to the large dis-
crepancy between factors of variation ranging from image
background content to camera viewpoint. To better ana-
lyze these factors of variation, we propose the use of dis-
entangled representations and a disentangled variational
autoencoder (dVAE) that allows for speciﬁc sampling and
inference of these factors. The derived objective from the
variational lower bound as well as the proposed training
strategy are highly ﬂexible, allowing us to handle cross-
modal encoders and decoders as well as semi-supervised
learning scenarios. Experiments show that our dVAE can
synthesize highly realistic images of the hand speciﬁable by
both pose and image background content and also estimate
3D hand poses from RGB images with accuracy competitive
with state-of-the-art on two public benchmarks.

1. Introduction

Vision-based hand pose estimation has progressed very
rapidly in the past years [27, 38], driven in part by its po-
tential for use in human-computer interaction applications.
Advancements are largely due to the widespread availability
of commodity depth sensors as well as the strong learning
capabilities of deep neural networks. As a result, the major-
ity of state-of-the-art methods apply deep learning methods
to depth images [5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 18, 19, 32, 33]. Estimating
3D hand pose from single RGB images, however, is a less-
studied and more difﬁcult problem which has only recently
gained some attention [3, 16, 21, 25, 40].

Unlike depth, which is a 2.5D source of information,
RGB inputs have signiﬁcantly more ambiguities. These
ambiguities arise from the 3D to 2D projection and di-
verse backgrounds which are otherwise less pronounced in
depth images. As such, methods which tackle the problem
of monocular RGB hand pose estimation rely on learning
from large datasets [40]. However, given the difﬁculties
of accurately labelling hand poses in 3D, large-scale RGB
datasets collected to date are synthesized [16, 40]. Real

and image content), we learn a disentangled and speciﬁable rep-
resentation for RGB hand images in a VAE framework.

recorded datasets are much smaller, with only tens of se-
quences [30, 39]. This presents signiﬁcant challenges when
it comes to learning and motivates the need for strong kine-
matic and or image priors.

Even though straight-forward discriminative approaches
have shown great success in accurately estimating hand
poses,
there has also been growing interest in the use
of deep generative models such as adversarial networks
(GANs) [16, 32] and variational autoencoders (VAEs) [25].
Generative models can approximate and sample from the
underlying distribution of hand poses as well as the associ-
ated images, and depending on the model formulation, may
enable semi-supervised learning. This is particularly ap-
pealing for hand pose estimation, for which data with accu-
rate ground truth can be difﬁcult to obtain. One caveat, how-
ever, is that in their standard formulation, GANs and VAEs
learn only black-box latent representations. Such repre-
sentations offer little control for conditioning upon human-
interpretable factors. Of the deep generative works pre-
sented to date [16, 25, 32], the latent representations are
speciﬁable only by hand pose. Consequently it is possible
to sample only a single (average) image per pose.

9877

A recent work combining VAEs and GANs [4] intro-
duced a conditional dependency structure to learn image
backgrounds and demonstrated the possibility of transfer-
ring body poses onto different images.
Inspired by this
work, we would like to learn a similar latent representation
that can disentangle the different factors that inﬂuence how
hands may appear visually, i.e. normalized hand pose, cam-
era viewpoint, scene context and background, etc. At the
same time, we want to ensure that the disentangled repre-
sentation remains sufﬁciently discriminative to make highly
accurate estimates of 3D hand pose.

We present in this paper a disentangled variational au-
toencoder (dVAE) – a novel framework for learning disen-
tangled representations of hand poses and hand images. As
the factors that we would like to disentangle belong to dif-
ferent modalities, we begin with a cross-modal VAE [20,
25] as the baseline upon which we deﬁne our dVAE. By
construction, our latent space is a disentangled one, com-
posed of sub-spaces calculated by factors and a training
strategy to fuse different latent space into one disentangled
latent space. We show how these disentangled factors can
be learned from both independent and confounding label in-
puts. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is
the ﬁrst disentangled representation that is able to both syn-
thesize hand images and estimate hand poses with explicit
control over the latent space. A schematic illustration of our
dVAE and the disentangled factors is shown in Fig. 1. We
summarize our contributions below:

• We propose a novel disentangled VAE model crossing
different modalities; this model is the ﬁrst VAE-based
model that uses independent factors of variations to
learn disentangled representations.

• Our dVAE model is highly ﬂexible and handles mul-
tiple tasks including RGB hand image synthesis, pose
transfer and 3D pose estimation from RGB images.

• We enable explicit control over different factors of
variation and introduce the ﬁrst model with multiple
degrees of freedom for synthesizing hand images.

• We decouple the learning of disentangling factors and
the embedding of image content and introduce two
variants of learning algorithms for both independent
and confounding labels.

2. Related Works

2.1. Hand Pose Estimation

Much of the progress made in hand pose estimation have
focused on using depth image inputs [5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15,
18, 19, 32, 33, 35]. State-of-the-art methods use a convolu-
tional neural network (CNN) architecture, with the majority
of works treating the depth input as 2D pixels, though a few

more recent approaches treat depth inputs as a set of 3D
points and or voxels [7, 5, 15].

Estimating hand poses from monocular RGB inputs is
more challenging. Early methods could recognize only a
restricted set of poses [1, 36] or used simpliﬁed hand rep-
resentations instead of full 3D skeletons [26, 37]. In more
recent approaches, the use of deep learning and CNNs has
become common-place [3, 21, 40]. In [16, 25], deep gener-
ative models such as variational auto-encoders (VAE) [25]
and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [16] are ap-
plied, which makes feasible not only to estimate pose, but
also generate RGB images from given hand poses.

Two hand pose estimation approaches [32, 25] stand out
for being similar to ours in spirit. They also use shared la-
tent spaces, even though the nature of these spaces are very
different. Wan et al. [32] learns two separate latent spaces,
one for hand poses and one for depth images, and uses a
one-to-one mapping function to connect the two. Spurr et
al. [25] learns a latent space that cross multiple hand modal-
ities, such as RGB to pose and depth to pose. To force the
cross-modality pairings onto a single latent space, separate
VAEs are learned in an alternating fashion, with one input
modality contributing to the loss per iteration. Such a learn-
ing strategy is non-ideal, as it tends to result in ﬂuctuations
in the latent space and has no guarantees for convergence.
Additionally, by assuming all crossing modalities as one-to-
one mappings, only one image can be synthesized per pose.
Different from [32] and [25], our dVAE learns a single
latent space by design. We learn the latent space with the
different modalities jointly, as opposed to alternating frame-
work of [25]. We ﬁnd that our joint learning is more stable
and has better convergence properties. And because we ex-
plicitly model and disentangle image factors, we can handle
one-to-many mappings, i.e. synthesize multiple images of
the same hand pose.

2.2. Disentangled Representations

Disentangled representations separate data according to
salient factors of variation and have recently been learned
with deep generative models such as VAEs and GANs.
Such representations have been applied successfully to im-
age editing [2, 4, 13, 17, 24, 28], video generation [29]
and image-to-image translation [12].
Several of these
works [24, 28, 29, 34], however, require specially designed
layers and loss functions, making the architectures difﬁcult
to work with and extend beyond their intended task.

Previous works learning disentangled representations
with VAEs [2, 12, 13] typically require additional weak la-
bels such as grouping information [2, 13] and pairwise sim-
ilarities [12]. Such labels can be difﬁcult to obtain and are
often not deﬁned for continuous variables such as hand pose
and viewpoint. In [4, 17], a conditional dependency struc-
ture is proposed to train disentangled representations for a

9878

semi-supervised learning. The work of [4] resembles ours
in the sense that they also disentangle pose from appear-
ance; however, their conditional dependency structure is
sensitive to the number of factors. As the number of factors
grows, the complexity of the network structure increases ex-
ponentially. In comparison to existing VAE approaches, we
are able to learn interpretable and disentangled representa-
tions by the shared latent space produced by image and its
corresponding factors without additional weak labels.

3. Methodology

3.1. Cross Modal VAE

Before we present how a disentangled latent space
can be incorporated into a VAE framework across differ-
ent modalities, we ﬁrst describe the original cross modal
VAE [20, 25]. As the name suggests, the cross modal VAE
aims to learn a VAE model across two different modalities
x and y. We begin by deﬁning the log probability of the
joint distribution p(x, y). Since working with this distribu-
tion is intractable, one maximizes the evidence lower bound
(ELBO) instead via a latent variable z. Note that x and y
are assumed to be conditionally independent given the la-
tent z, i.e. (x ⊥ y | z).

log p(x, y) ≥ ELBOcVAE(x, y, θx, θy, φ)

(1)
= Ez∼qφ log pθx (x|z) + Ez∼qφ log pθy (y|z)
− DKL(qφ(z|x)||p(z)).

Here, DKL(·) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The vari-
ational approximation qφ(z|x) can be thought of as an en-
coder from x to z, while pθx (x|z) and pθy (y|z) can be
thought of as decoders from z to x and z to y respectively.
p(z) = N (0, I) is a Gaussian prior on the latent space.

In the context of hand pose estimation, x would represent
the RGB or depth image modality and y the hand skeleton
modality. One can then estimate hand poses from images
by encoding the image x into the latent space and decoding
the corresponding 3D hand pose y. A variant of this model
was applied in [25] and shown to successfully estimate hand
poses from RGB images or depth images.

3.2. Disentangled VAE

In our disentangled VAE, we deﬁne a latent variable z
which can be deterministically decomposed into N + 1 in-
dependent factors {zy1 , zy2 , ..., zyN , zu}. Of these factors,
{zyi}i=1...N are directly associated with observed variables
{yi}i=1...N . zu is an extra latent factor which is not inde-
pendently associated with any observed variables; it may or
may not be included (compare Fig. 2a versus Fig. 2b).

zyi without zu, i.e. all latent factors can be associated with
some observed yi. For clarity, we limit our explanation to
N = 2, though the theory generalizes to higher N as well.
Our derivation can be separated into a disentangling step
and an embedding step. In the disentangling step, we ﬁrst
consider the joint distribution between x, y1 and y2. The
evidence lower bound of this distribution can be deﬁned as:

log p(x,y1, y2) ≥ ELBOdis(x, y1, y2, φy1 , φy2 , θy1 , θy2 , θx)

log pθx (x|z)

= λxEz∼qφy1 ,φy2

log pθy1 (y1|zy1 )
log pθy2 (y2|zy2 )

∼qφy1

∼qφy2

(2)

where the λs and β are additional hyperparameters added to
trade off between latent space capacity and reconstruction
accuracy, as recommended by the β trick [10].

The ELBO in Eq. 2 allows us to deﬁne a disentangled
z = [zy1 , zy2 ] based on y1, y2 and x.
In this step, one
can learn the encoding and decoding of yi to and from zyi ,
as well as the decoding of z to x. However, the mapping
from x to z is still missing so we need an additional embed-
ding step [31] to learn the encoder qφx (z|x). Keeping all
decoders ﬁxed, qφx (z|x) can be learned by maximizing:

L(φx|θy1 , θy2 , θx) = −DKL (qφx (z|x)||pθ(z|x, y1, y2))
(3)

= ELBOemb(x, y1, y2, φx) − log p(x, y1, y2).

Fully speciﬁed latent z: We begin ﬁrst by consider-
ing the simpliﬁed case in which z can be fully speciﬁed by

Since the second term is constant with respect to φx and the
θ’s, the objective simpliﬁes to the following evidence lower

(4)

Combining the disentangling and embedding evidence
lower bounds, we get the following joint objective:

L(φx,φy1 , φy2 , θx, θy1 , θy2 ) =

ELBOdis(x, y1, y2, φy1 , φy2 , θx, θy1 , θy2 )

+ELBOemb(x, y1, y2, φx).

(5)

The above derivation shows that the encoding of modal-
ity x can be decoupled from y1 and y2 via a disentangled
latent space. We detail the training strategy for the fully
speciﬁed version of the dVAE in Alg. 1.

Additional zu: When learning a latent variable model,
many latent factors may be very difﬁcult to associate in-
dependently with an observation (label), e.g. the style of
handwritten digits, or the background content in an RGB
image [4, 13, 2]. Nevertheless, we may still want to disen-
tangle such factors from those which can be associated in-
dependently. We model these factors in aggregate form via
a single latent variable zu and show how zu can be disen-
tangled from the other zyi which are associated with direct
observations yi. For clarity of discussion, we limit N = 1,
such that z = [zy1 , zu]. To disentangle zu from z, both of
which are speciﬁed by a confounding x, we aim to make
zu and y1 conditionally independent given zy1 To achieve
this, we try to make p(y1|zy1 , zu) approximately equal to

by random sampling of zu and minimizing the distance be-
tween p(y1|zy1 , zu) and p(y1|zy1 ). The training strategy
for this is detailed in Alg. 2. In this case, the joint distribu-
tion of x and y1 has the following evidence lower bound in
the disentangling step with hyperparameters λ′′ and β ′′:

log p(x, y1) ≥ ELBOu

(6)

Note that in the above ELBO, zu is encoded from x by qφu
instead of being speciﬁed by some observed label u, as was
done previously in [13, 2, 4]. After this modiﬁed disentan-
gling step, we can apply the same embedding step in Eq. 3
to learn qφx (z|x).

Multiple x modalities: The situation may arise in which
we have multiple input modalities which fully specify and
share the latent space of z, i.e. not only an x but also an ad-
ditional ˆx (see Fig. 2c). Here, it is possible to ﬁrst consider
the joint distribution between x, y1 and y2, and maximize
the ELBO in Eq. 2 for the disentangling step. To link the
two modalities of x and ˆx into the same disentangled latent
space and embed ˆx, we can use the following:

L(φˆx|θx, θy1 , θy2 ) = −DKL(qφˆx (z|ˆx)||pθ(z|x, y1, y2))

= ELBO′

emb(ˆx, x, y1, y2, φˆx) − log p(x, y1, y2).

Similar to Eq. 4, we get the following evidence lower bound
with λ′′′ and β ′′′ as hyperparameters:

(8)

For learning, one simply encodes ˆx with qφˆx (z|ˆx) to z in-
stead of pφx (z|x) as shown currently in line 9 of Alg. 1. A
full derivation of the dVAE and its variants is given in the
supplementary.

3.3. Applications

Based on the theory proposed above, we develop two ap-
plications: image synthesis and pose estimation from RGB
images. Like [40], we distinguish between an absolute 3D
hand pose (3DPose), a canonical hand pose (CPose), and a
viewpoint. The canonical pose is a normalized version of
the 3D pose within the canonical frame, while viewpoint is
the rotation matrix that rotates CPose to 3DPose.

Figure 3: Inference models for the tasks of image synthesis (left and middle) and pose estimation (right).

In image synthesis, we would like to sample values of
z and decode this into an image x via the generative model
pθx . To control the images being sampled, we want to have
a latent z which is disentangled with respect to the 3DPose,
and image (background) content, i.e. all aspects of the RGB
image not speciﬁcally related to the hand pose itself. A
schematic of the image synthesis is shown in the left panel
of Fig. 3; in this case, we follow the model in Fig. 2a and
use Alg. 1. Here, y1 would represent 3DPose and y2 would
represent the image content; similar to [29], this content is
speciﬁed by a representative tag image. By changing the
inputs y1 and y2, i.e. by varying the 3DPose and content
through the encoders qφy1
, we synthesize new im-
ages with speciﬁed poses and background content. Further-
more, we can also evaluate the pose error of the synthesized
image via the pose decoder pθy1

and qφy2

.

Tag images for specifying background content are easy

to obtain if one has video sequences from which to extract
RGB frames. However, for some scenarios, this may not be
the case, i.e. if each RGB image in the training set contains
different background content. This is what necessitates the
model in Fig. 2b and the learning algorithm in Alg. 2. In
such a scenario, y1 again represents the 3DPose, while the
image content is modelled indirectly through x. For test-
ing purposes, however, there is no distinction between the
two variants, as input is still given in the form of a desired
3DPose and an RGB image specifying the content.

For hand pose estimation, we aim to predict 3DPose x,
CPose y1 and viewpoint y2 from RGB image ˆx according
to the model in Fig. 2c by disentangling z into the CPose
zy1 and viewpoint zy2 . In this case, we embed x and ˆx into
a shared latent space. We apply inference as shown by the
right panel in Fig. 3 and learn the model with Alg. 1. More-
over, because annotated training data is sparse in real world
applications, we can further leverage unlabelled or weakly
labelled. Our proposed method consists of multiple VAEs,
which can be trained respectively for semi- and weakly-
supervised setting. For semi-supervised setting, we use both
labelled and unlabelled CPose, viewpoint and 3DPose data
to train the encoders qφy1
and all decoders in the dis-
entangled step. For weakly-supervised setting, we exploit
images and their weak labels like viewpoint y2 by training
the VAE with qφˆx and pθy2

in the embedding step.

4. Experimentation

A good disentangled representation should show good
performance on both discriminative tasks such as hand pose
estimation as well as generative tasks. We transfer attributes
between images and infer 3D hand poses from monocular
hand RGB images via disentangled representations. More
precisely, for image synthesis, we transfer image content
with ﬁxed 3DPose, while for 3D hand pose estimation, we
predict viewpoint, CPose and 3DPose.

4.1. Implementation details

Our architecture consists of multiple encoders and de-
coders. For encoding images, we use Resnet-18 [9]; for

decoding images, we follow the decoder architecture DC-
GAN [22]. For encoding and decoding hand poses, we use
six fully connected layers with 512 hidden units. Exact ar-
chitectural speciﬁcations are provided in the supplementary.
For learning, we use the ADAM optimizer with a learn-
ing rate of 10−4, a batch size of 32. We ﬁx the dimension-
ality of d of z to 64 and set the dimensionality of sub-latent
variable zy1 and zy2 to 32 and 32. For all applications, the
λ’s are ﬁxed (λx = 1, λy1 = λy2 = 0.01) while we must
adjust β (β = 100 for image synthesis, β ′′′ = 0.01 for pose
estimation). Further discussion on the impact of β and d
can be found in the supplementary.

grounds. The dataset is highly challenging due to the di-
verse visual scenery, illumination and noise. It is composed
of 42k images for training and 2.7k images for testing.

For quantitative evaluation and comparison with other
works on 3D hand pose estimation, we use the common
metrics, mean end-point-error (EPE) and the area under the
curve (AUC) on the percentage of correct keypoints (PCK)
score. Mean EPE is deﬁned as the average euclidean dis-
tance between predicted and groundtruth keypoints; PCK is
the percentage of predicted keypoints that fall within some
given distance with respect to the ground truth.

4.2. Datasets & Evaluation

4.3. Synthesizing Images

We evaluate our proposed method on two publicly avail-
able datasets: Stereo Hand Pose Tracking Benchmark
(STB) [39] and Rendered Hand Pose Dataset (RHD) [40].

The STB dataset features videos of a single person’s left
hand in front of 6 real-world indoor backgrounds. It pro-
vides the 3D positions of palm and ﬁnger joints for approx-
imately 18k stereo pairs with 640 × 480 resolution. Image
synthesis is relatively easy for this dataset due to the small
number of backgrounds. To evaluate our model’s pose es-
timation accuracy, we use the 15k / 3k training/test split as
given by [40]. For evaluating our dVAE’s generative mod-
elling capabilities, we disentangle z into two content and
3DPose according to the model in Fig. 2a synthesize im-
ages with ﬁxed poses as per the left-most model in Fig. 3.

RHD is a synthesized dataset of rendered hand images
with 320 × 320 resolution from 20 characters performing

We evaluate the ability of our model to synthesize im-
ages by sampling from latent space walks and by transfer-
ring pose from one image to another.

For the fully speciﬁed latent z model we show the
synthesized images (see Fig. 4) when we interpolate the
3DPose while keeping the image content ﬁxed (rows 1-
3) and when we interpolate image content while keeping
the pose ﬁxed.
In both latent space walks, the recon-
structed poses as well as the synthesized images demon-
strate a smoothness and consistency of the latent space.

We can also extract disentangled latent factors from dif-
ferent hand images and then recombine them to transfer
poses from one image to another. Fig. 6 shows the results
when we take poses from one image (leftmost column),
content from other images (top row) and recombine them
(rows 2-3, columns 3-5). We are able to accurately transfer

the 3DPose stays well-ﬁxed, while the content changes
smoothly between the two input images, demonstrating our
model’s ability to disentangle the image background con-
tent even with out speciﬁc tag images for training.

4.4. 3D hand pose estimation

We evaluate the ability of our dVAE to estimate 3D hand
poses from RGB images based on the model variant de-
scribed in Section 3.3 and compare against state-of-the-art
methods [3, 25, 40, 16, 21] on both the RHD and STB
datasets. In [40], a two-stream architecture is applied to es-
timate viewpoint and CPose; these two are then combined
to predict 3DPose. To be directly comparable, we disentan-
gle the latent z into a viewpoint factor and a CPose factor,
as shown in Fig. 3 right. Note that due to the decomposi-
tional nature of our latent space, we can predict viewpoint,
CPose and 3DPose through one latent space.

We follow the experimental setting in [40, 25] that left vs
right handedness and scale are given at test time. We aug-
ment the training data by rotating the images in the range
of [−180◦, 180◦] and making random ﬂips along the y-axis
while applying the same transformations to the ground truth
labels. We compare the mean EPE in Fig. 7 right. We
outperform [40] on both CPose and 3DPose. These results
highlight the strong capabilities of our dVAE model for ac-
curate hand pose estimation. Our mean EPE is very close
to that of [25], while our 3D PCK is slightly better. As
such, we conclude that the pose estimation capabilities of
our model is comparable to that of [25], though our model
is able to obtain a disentangled representation and make full
use of weak labels. We compare the PCK curves with state-
of-the-art methods [3, 25, 40, 16, 21] on both datasets in
Fig. 7. Our method is comparable or better than most exist-
ing methods except [3], which has a higher AUC of 0.038 on
RHD and 0.03 on STB for the PCK. However, these results
are not directly comparable, as [3] incorporate depth images
as an additional source of training data. Fig. 8 shows some
our estimated hand poses from both RHD and STB datasets.
Semi-, weakly-supervised learning: To evaluate our
method in semi- and weakly-supervised settings, we sam-
ple the ﬁrst m% images as labelled data and the rest as
unlabelled data by discarding the labels of 3DPose, CPose
and viewpoint. We also consider using only viewpoints as
a weak label while discarding 3DPose and CPose. For the
RHD dataset, we vary m% from 5% to 100% and compare
the mean EPE against the fully supervised setting. We can
see that our model makes full use of additional information.
With CPose, viewpoint and 3DPose labels, we improve the
mean EPE up to 3.5%. With additional images and view-
point labels, the improvement is up to 7.5%.

Figure 6: Pose transfer. The ﬁrst column corresponds to images
from which we extract the 3DPose (ground truth pose in second
column); the ﬁrst row corresponds to tag images columns we ex-
tract the latent content; the 2-3 rows, 3-5 columns are pose trans-
ferred images.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a VAE-based method for
learning disentangled representations of hand poses and
hand images. We ﬁnd that our model allows us to synthe-

size highly realistic looking RGB images of hands with full
control over factors of variation such as image background
content and hand pose. However, the factors of variation
here should be independent. This is a valid assumption for
hand images, but we will consider to relax the need of inde-
pendence between factors and further investigate disentan-
gled representations with multimodal learning.

For hand pose estimation, our model is competitive with
state of the art and is also able to leverage unlabelled and
weak labels. Currently, STB is the standard benchmark for
real-world monocular RGB hand pose estimation. How-
ever, since the featured background content and hand poses
are quite simple, performance by state-of-the-art methods
on this dataset has become saturated. For the 3D PCK,
recent works [3, 25, 40, 16, 21] achieve AUC values for
error thresholds of 20-50mm ranging from 96% to more
than 99%. As such, we encourage members of the com-
munity to collect more challenging benchmarks for RGB
hand pose estimation. In particular, for the monocular sce-
nario, one possibility would be to collect multi-view [23]
and also multi-modal data, i.e. RGBD, from which it is pos-
sible to use highly accurate model-based trackers to esti-
mate ground truth labels.
