Abstract

Humans perceive the world using multi-modal sensory
inputs such as vision, audition, and touch. In this work, we
investigate the cross-modal connection between vision and
touch. The main challenge in this cross-domain modeling
task lies in the signiﬁcant scale discrepancy between the
two: while our eyes perceive an entire visual scene at once,
humans can only feel a small region of an object at any given
moment. To connect vision and touch, we introduce new tasks
of synthesizing plausible tactile signals from visual inputs as
well as imagining how we interact with objects given tactile
data as input. To accomplish our goals, we ﬁrst equip robots
with both visual and tactile sensors and collect a large-scale
dataset of corresponding vision and tactile image sequences.
To close the scale gap, we present a new conditional ad-
versarial model that incorporates the scale and location
information of the touch. Human perceptual studies demon-
strate that our model can produce realistic visual images
from tactile data and vice versa. Finally, we present both
qualitative and quantitative experimental results regarding
different system designs, as well as visualizing the learned
representations of our model.

1. Introduction

People perceive the world in a multi-modal way where
vision and touch are highly intertwined [24, 42]: when we
close our eyes and use only our ﬁngertips to sense an object
in front of us, we can make guesses about its texture and ge-
ometry. For example in Figure 1d, one can probably tell that
s/he is touching a piece of delicate fabric based on its tactile
“feeling”; similarly, we can imagine the feeling of touch by
just seeing the object. In Figure 1c, without directly contact-
ing the rim of a mug, we can easily imagine the sharpness
and hardness of the touch merely by our visual perception.
The underlying reason for this cross-modal connection is
the shared physical properties that inﬂuence both modalities
such as local geometry, texture, roughness, hardness and so
on. Therefore, it would be desirable to build a computational
model that can extract such shared representations from one
modality and transfer them to the other.

In this work, we present a cross-modal prediction system

given the collected vision-tactile pairs, we train cross-modal pre-
diction networks for several tasks: (c) Learning to feel by seeing
(vision → touch): predicting the a touch signal from its correspond-
ing vision input and reference images and (d) Learning to see by
touching (touch → vision): predicting vision from touch. The
predicted touch locations and ground truth locations (marked with
yellow arrows in (d)) share a similar feeling. Please check out our

between vision and touch with the goals of learning to see
by touching and learning to feel by seeing. Different from
other cross-modal prediction problems where sensory data
in different domains are roughly spatially aligned [13, 1], the

scale gap between vision and touch signals is huge. While
our visual perception system processes the entire scene as
a whole, our ﬁngers can only sense a tiny fraction of the
object at any given moment. To investigate the connections
between vision and touch, we introduce two cross-modal
prediction tasks: (1) synthesizing plausible temporal tactile
signals from vision inputs, and (2) predicting which object
and which object part is being touched directly from tactile
inputs. Figure 1c and d show a few representative results.

To accomplish these tasks, we build a robotic system to
automate the process of collecting large-scale visual-touch
pairs. As shown in Figure 1a, a robot arm is equipped with
a tactile sensor called GelSight [15]. We also set up a stan-
dalone web camera to record visual information of both
objects and arms. In total, we recorded 12, 000 touches on
195 objects from a wide range of categories. Each touch
action contains a video sequence of 250 frames, resulting in
3 million visual and tactile paired images. The usage of the
dataset is not limited to the above two applications.

Our model

is built on conditional adversarial net-
works [11, 13]. The standard approach [13] yields less
satisfactory results in our tasks due to the following two
challenges. First, the scale gap between vision and touch
makes the previous methods [13, 39] less suitable as they
are tailored for spatially aligned image pairs. To address this
scale gap, we incorporate the scale and location information
of the touch into our model, which signiﬁcantly improves the
results. Second, we encounter severe mode collapse during
GANs training when the model generates the same output
regardless of inputs. It is because the majority of our tactile
data only contain ﬂat regions as often times, robots arms are
either in the air or touching textureless surface, To prevent
mode collapse, we adopt a data rebalancing strategy to help
the generator produce diverse modes.

We present both qualitative results and quantitative anal-
ysis to evaluate our model. The evaluations include human
perceptual studies regarding the photorealism of the results,
as well as objective measures such as the accuracy of touch
locations and the amount of deformation in the GelSight im-
ages. We also perform ablation studies regarding alternative
model choices and objective functions. Finally, we visualize
the learned representations of our model to help understand
what it has captured.

2. Related Work

Cross-modal learning and prediction People understand
our visual world through many different modalities.
In-
spired by this, many researchers proposed to learn shared
embeddings from multiple domains such as words and im-
ages [9], audio and videos [32, 2, 36], and texts and visual
data [33, 34, 1]. Our work is mostly related to cross-modal
prediction, which aims to predict data in one domain from
another. Recent work has tackle different prediction tasks

such as using vision to predict sound [35] and generating
captions for images [20, 17, 41, 6], thanks to large-scale
paired cross-domain datasets, which are not currently avail-
able for vision and touch. We circumvent this difﬁculty by
automating the data collection process with robots.

Vision and touch To give intelligent robots the same tac-
tile sensing ability, different types of force, haptic, and tac-
tile sensors [22, 23, 5, 16] have been developed over the
decades. Among them, GelSight [14, 15, 43] is consid-
ered among the best high-resolution tactile sensors. Re-
cently, researchers have used GelSight and other types of
force and tactile sensors for many vision and robotic appli-
cations [45, 47, 44, 26, 27, 25]. Yuan et al. [46] studied
physical and material properties of fabrics by fusing visual,
depth, and tactile sensors. Calandra et al. [3] proposed a
visual-tactile model for predicting grasp outcomes. Different
from prior work that used vision and touch to improve indi-
vidual tasks, in this work we focus on several cross-modal
prediction tasks, investigating whether we can predict one
signal from the other.

Image-to-image translation Our model is built upon re-
cent work on image-to-image translation [13, 28, 50], which
aims to translate an input image from one domain to a photo-
realistic output in the target domain. The key to its success
relies on adversarial training [11, 30], where a discriminator
is trained to distinguish between the generated results and
real images from the target domain. This method enables
many applications such as synthesizing photos from user
sketches [13, 38], changing night to day [13, 51], and turn-
ing semantic layouts into natural scenes [13, 39]. Prior work
often assumes that input and output images are geometri-
cally aligned, which does not hold in our tasks due to the
dramatic scale difference between two modalities. Therefore,
we design objective functions and architectures to sidestep
this scale mismatch. In Section 5, we show that we can
obtain more visually appealing results compared to recent
methods [13].

3. VisGel Dataset

Here we describe our data collection procedure including
the tactile sensor we used, the way that robotic arms interact-
ing with objects, and a diverse object set that includes 195
different everyday items from a wide range of categories.

Data collection setup Figure 1a illustrates the setup in our
experiments. We use KUKA LBR iiwa industrial robotic
arms to automate the data collection process. The arm is
equipped with a GelSight sensor [43] to collect raw tactile
images. We set up a webcam on a tripod at the back of
the arm to capture videos of the scenes where the robotic
arm touching the objects. We use recorded timestamps to
synchronize visual and tactile images.

Figure 2. Object set. Here we show the object set used in training
and test. The dataset includes a wide range of objects from food
items, tools, kitchen items, to fabrics and stationery.

GelSight sensor The GelSight sensor [14, 15, 43] is an
optical tactile sensor that measures the texture and geome-
try of a contact surface at very high spatial resolution [15].
The surface of the sensor is a soft elastomer painted with a
reﬂective membrane that deforms to the shape of the object
upon contact, and the sensing area is about 1.5cm × 1.5cm.
Underneath this elastomer is an ordinary camera that views
the deformed gel. The colored LEDs illuminate the gel from
different directions, resulting in a three-channel surface nor-
mal image (Figure 1b). GelSight also uses markers on the
membrane and recording the ﬂow ﬁeld of the marker move-
ment to sketched the deformation. The 2D image format of
the raw tactile data allows us to use standard convolutional
neural networks (CNN) [21] for processing and extracting
tactile information. Figure 1c and d show a few examples of
collected raw tactile data.
Objects dataset Figure 2 shows all the 195 objects used
in our study. To collect such a diverse set of objects, we start
from Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) dataset [4], a standard
daily life object dataset widely used in robotic manipulation
research. We use 45 objects with a wide range of shapes,
textures, weight, sizes, and rigidity. We discard the rest of
the 25 small objects (e.g., plastic nut) as they are occluded
by the robot arm from the camera viewpoint. To further
increase the diversity of objects, we obtain additional 150
new consumer products that include the categories in the
YCB dataset (i.e., food items, tool items, shape items, task
items, and kitchen items) as well as new categories such as
fabrics and stationery. We use 165 objects during our training
and 30 seen and 30 novel objects during test. Each scene
contains 4 ∼ 10 randomly placed objects that sometimes
overlap with each other.

Generating touch proposals A random touch at an arbi-
trary location may be suboptimal due to two reasons. First,
the robotic arm can often touch nothing but the desk. Second,
the arm may touch in an undesirable direction or unexpect-
edly move the object so that the GelSight Sensor fails to
capture any tactile signal. To address the above issues and
generate better touch proposals, we ﬁrst reconstruct 3D point
clouds of the scene with a real-time SLAM system called
ElasticFusion [40]. We then sample a random touch region

whose surface normals are mostly perpendicular to the desk.
The touching direction is important as it allows robot arms
to ﬁrmly press the object without moving it.

Dataset Statistics We have collected synchronized tactile
images and RGB images for 195 objects. Table 1 shows the
basic statistics of the dataset for both training and test. To
our knowledge, this is the largest vision-touch dataset.

4. Cross-Modal Prediction

We propose a cross-modal prediction method for predict-
ing vision from touch and vice versa. First, we describe our
basic method based on conditional GANs [13] in Section 4.1.
We further improve the accuracy and the quality of our pre-
diction results with three modiﬁcations tailored for our tasks
in Section 4.2. We ﬁrst incorporate the scale and location of
the touch into our model. Then, we use a data rebalancing
mechanism to increase the diversity of our results. Finally,
we further improve the temporal coherence and accuracy of
our results by extracting temporal information from nearby
input frames. In Section 4.3, we describe the details of our
training procedure as well as network designs.

4.1. Conditional GANs

Our approach is built on the pix2pix method [13], a re-
cently proposed general-purpose conditional GANs frame-
work for image-to-image translation. In the context of vision-
touch cross-modal prediction, the generator G takes either a
vision or tactile image x as an input and produce an output
image in the other domain with y = G(x). The discrimina-
tor D observes both the input image x and the output result
y: D(x, y) → [0, 1]. During training, the discriminator
D is trained to reveal the differences between synthesized
results and real images while the objective of the genera-
tor G is to produce photorealistic results that can fool the
discriminator D. We train the model with vision-touch im-
age pairs {(x, y)}. In the task of touch → vision, x is a
touch image and y is the corresponding visual image. The
same thing applies to the vision → touch direction, i.e.,
(x, y) = (visual image, touch image). Conditional GANs
can be optimized via the following min-max objective:

G∗ = arg min

G

max

D

LGAN(G, D) + λL1(G)

(1)

where the adversarial loss LGAN(G, D) is derived as:

E(x,y)[log D(x, y)] + E

x[log(1 − D(x, G(x))],

4.2. Improving Photorealism and Accuracy

We ﬁrst experimented with the above conditional GANs
framework. Unfortunately, as shown in the Figure 4, the
synthesized results are far from satisfactory, often looking
unrealistic and suffering from severe visual artifacts. Besides,
the generated results do not align well with input signals.

To address the above issues, we make a few modiﬁcations
to the basic algorithm, which signiﬁcantly improve the qual-
ity of the results as well as the match between input-output
pairs. We ﬁrst feed tactile and visual reference images to
both the generator and the discriminator so that the model
only needs to learn to model cross-modal changes rather than
the entire signal. Second, we use a data-driven data rebalanc-
ing mechanism in our training so that the network is more
robust to mode collapse problem where the data is highly
imbalanced. Finally, we extract information from multiple
neighbor frames of input videos rather than the current frame
alone, producing temporal coherent outputs.

Using reference tactile and visual images As we have
mentioned before, the scale between a touch signal and a
visual image is huge as a GelSight sensor can only contact
a very tiny portion w.r.t.
the visual image. This makes

the cross-modal prediction between vision and touch quite
challenging. Regarding touch to vision, we need to solve
an almost impossible ‘extrapolation’ problem from a tiny
patch to an entire image. From vision to touch, the model
has to ﬁrst localize the location of the touch and then infer
the material and geometry of the touched region. Figure 4
shows a few results produced by conditional GANs model
described in Section 4.1, where no reference is used. The low
quality of the results is not surprising due to self-occlusion
and big scale discrepancy.

We sidestep this difﬁculty by providing our system both
the reference tactile and visual images as shown in Figure 1c
and d. A reference visual image captures the original scene
without any robot-object interaction. For vision to touch
direction, when the robot arm is operating, our model can
simply compare the current frame with its reference image
and easily identify the location and the scale of the touch.
For touch to vision direction, a reference visual image can
tell our model the original scene and our model only needs to
predict the location of the touch and hallucinate the robotic
arm, without rendering the entire scene from scratch. A
reference tactile image captures the tactile response when the
sensor touches nothing, which can help the system calibrate
the tactile input, as different GelSight sensors have different
lighting distribution and black dot patterns.

In particular, we feed both vision and tactile reference
images r = (xref, yref) to the generator G and the discrim-
inator D. As the reference image and the output often
share common low-level features, we introduce skip con-
nections [37, 12] between the encoder convolutional layers
and transposed-convolutional layers in our decoder.

In our recorded data, around 60 percent-
Data rebalancing
age of times, the robot arm is in the air without touching any
object. This results in a huge data imbalance issue, where
more than half of our tactile data has only near-ﬂat responses
without any texture or geometry. This highly imbalanced
dataset causes severe model collapse during GANs train-
ing [10]. To address it, we apply data rebalancing technique,
widely used in classiﬁcation tasks [8, 48].
In particular,
during the training, we reweight the loss of each data pair
(xt, r, yt) based on its rarity score wt. In practice, we cal-
culate the rarity score based on a ad-hoc metric. We ﬁrst
compute a residual image kxt − xrefk between the current
tactile data xt and its reference tactile data xref. We then sim-
ply calculate the variance of Laplacian derivatives over the
difference image. For IO efﬁciency, instead of reweighting,
we sample the training data pair (xt, r, yt) with the proba-
bility w
t . We denote the resulting data distribution as pw.
Figure 5 shows a few qualitative results demonstrating the
improvement by using data rebalancing. Our evaluation in
Section 5 also shows the effectiveness of data rebalancing.

Incorporating temporal cues We ﬁnd that our initial re-
sults look quite realistic, but the predicted output sequences
and input sequences are often out of sync (Figure 7). To ad-
dress this temporal mismatch issue, we use multiple nearby
frames of the input signal in addition to its current frame. In
practice, we sample 5 consecutive frames every 2 frames:
¯xt = {xt−4, xt−2, xt, xt+2, xt+4} at a particular moment t.
To reduce data redundancy, we only use grayscale images
and leave the reference image as RGB.

Our full model Figure 3 shows an overview of our ﬁnal
cross-modal prediction model. The generator G takes both
input data ¯xt = {xt−4, xt−2, xt, xt+2, xt+4} as well as ref-
erence vision and tactile images r = (xref, yref) and produce
a output image ˆyt = G(¯xt, r) at moment t in the target
domain. We extend the minimax objective (Equation 1)

t,r,y

E(¯x

t)[log D(¯xt, r, yt)] + E(¯x

LGAN(G, D) + λL1(G), where LGAN(G, D) is as follows:
t,r)[log(1 − D(¯xt, r, ˆyt)],
(4)
where G and D both takes both temporal data ¯xt and refer-
ence images r as inputs. Similarly, the regression loss L1(G)
can be calculated as:

L1(G) = E(¯x

t,r,y

t)∼pw ||yt − ˆyt||1

Figure 3 shows a sample input-output combination where
the network takes a sequence of visual images and the cor-
responding references as inputs, synthesizing a tactile pre-
diction as output. The same framework can be applied to the
touch → vision direction as well.

4.3. Implementation details

Network architectures We use an encoder-decoder archi-
tecture for our generator. For the encoder, we use two
ResNet18 models [12] for encoding input images x and
reference tactile and visual images r into 512 dimensional
latent vectors respectively. We concatenate two vectors from
both encoders into one 1024 dimensional vector and feed it
to the decoder that contains 5 standard strided-convolution
layers. As the output result looks close to one of the refer-
ence images, we add a few skip connections between the
convolutional layers from the reference branch in our en-
coder and strided-convolutional layers in the decoder. For
the discriminator, we use a standard ConvNets with multiple
convolutional layers. Please ﬁnd more architectural details
in our supplementary material.

Training We train the models with the Adam solver [18]
with a learning rate of 0.0002. We set λ = 10 for L1 loss.
We use LSGANs loss [29] rather than standard GANs [11]
for more stable training, as shown in prior work [50, 39].
We apply standard data augmentation techniques [19] includ-
ing random cropping and slightly perturbing the brightness,
contrast, saturation, and hue of input images.

5. Experiments

We evaluate our method on cross-modal prediction tasks
between vision and touch using the VisGel dataset. We
report multiple metrics that evaluate different aspects of
the predictions. When predicting touch from vision, we
measure (1) perceptual realism using AMT: whether results
look realistic, (2) the moment of contact: whether our model
can predict if a GelSight sensor is in contact with the object,
and (3) markers’ deformation: whether our model can track
the deformation of the membrane. Regarding touch → vision
direction, we evaluate our model using (1) visual realism
via AMT and (2) the sense of touch: whether the predicted
touch position shares a similar feel with the ground truth
position. We also include the evaluations regarding full-
reference metrics in the supplement. Please ﬁnd our code,
data, and more results on our website.

Table 2. Vision2Touch AMT “real vs fake” test. Our method
can synthesize more realistic tactile signals, compared to both
pix2pix [13] and our baselines, both for seen and novel objects.

We feed reference images to all the baselines, as they are

crucial for handling the scale discrepancy (Figure 4).

5.1. Vision → Touch

In this experiment, we compare our method with various
baselines. We ﬁrst run the trained models to generate Gel-
Sight outputs frame by frame and then concatenate adjacent
frames together into a video. Each video contains exactly
one action with 64 consecutive frames.

An ideal model should produce a perceptually realistic
and temporal coherent output. Furthermore, when humans
observe this kind of physical interaction, we can roughly
infer the moment of contact and the force being applied to
the touch; hence, we would also like to assess our model’s
understanding of the interaction. In particular, we evaluate
whether our model can predict the moment of contact as well
as the deformation of the markers grid.

Perceptual realism (AMT) Human subjective ratings
have been shown to be a more meaningful metric for image
synthesis tasks [48, 13] compared to metrics such as RMS
or SSIM. We follow a similar study protocol as described
in Zhang et al. [48] and run a real vs. fake forced-choice
test on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). In particular, we
present our participants with the ground truth tactile videos
and the predicted tactile results along with the vision inputs.
We ask which tactile video corresponds better to the input vi-
sion signal. As most people may not be familiar with tactile
data, we ﬁrst educate the participants with 5 typical ground
truth vision-touch video pairs and detailed instruction. In
total, we collect 8, 000 judgments for 1, 250 results. Table 2
shows that our full method can outperform the pix2pix [13]
as well as the alternative design choices on both seen objects
(different touches) and unseen objects.

The moment of contact The deformation on the GelSight
marker ﬁeld indicates whether and when a GelSight sensor
touches the surface. We evaluate our system by measuring
how well it can predict the moment of contact with respect
to the ground truth data from tactile sensors. We track the
GelSight markers and calculate the average L2 distance for
each marker. For each touch episode, we denote the largest
deformation distance as dmax and the smallest deformation as
dmin, we then set a cutoff threshold at r · (dmax − dmin) + dmin,
where r is set to 0.6 in our case. We mark the left most
and right most cutoff time point as tl and tr individually.

Figure 6. Vision2Touch - quantitative results. Top: Errors on
detecting the moment of contact. Our method generally performs
the best. The use of temporal cues can signiﬁcantly improve the
performance or our model. Bottom: Errors on the average markers’
deformation. Our method still works best.

Similarly, we compute the ground truth cutoff time as tgt
l and
tgt
r ; then the error of the moment of contact for this episode
is determined as econtact = |tl − tgt

l | + |tr − tgt
r |.

As shown in Figure 6a, the methods without temporal
cues produce a large error due to temporal misalignment.
Meanwhile, our model works better on seen objects than un-
seen objects, which coincides with the empirical observation
that human beings can better predict the touch outcomes if
we have interacted with the object before.

We also show a few deformation curves over the time.
Figure 7a illustrates a case where all the methods perform
well in detecting the ground truth moment of contact. Fig-
ure 7b shows an example where the model without temporal
cues completely missed the contact event. Figure 7c shows
another common situation, where the moment of contact
predicted by the method without temporal cues shifts from
the ground truth. Figure 7 shows several ground truth and
the predicted frames. As expected, a single-frame method
fails to accurately predict the contact moment.

Tracking markers’ deformation The ﬂow ﬁeld of the
GelSight markers characterizes the deformation of the mem-
brane, which is useful for representing contact forces as
well as detecting slippery [7]. In this section, we assess
our model’s ability by comparing the predicted deforma-
tion with the ground truth deformation. We calculate the
average L2 distance between each corresponding markers in
the ground truth and the generated touch image. Figure 6b
shows that the single-frame model performs the worst, as
it misses important temporal cues, which makes it hard to

object contact with a larger force. Top: Three typical cases, where

infer information like force and sliding.

Visualizing the learned representation We visualize the
learned representation using a recent network interpretation
method [49], which can highlight important image regions
for ﬁnal decisions (Figure 8a and b). Many meaningful pat-
terns emerge, such as arms hovering in the air or touching
ﬂat area and sharp edges. This result implies that our repre-
sentation learns shared information across two modalities.
Please see our supplemental material for more visualizations.

5.2. Touch → Vision

We can also go from touch to vision - by giving the model
a reference visual image and tactile signal, can the model
imagine where it is touching? It is impossible to locate the
GelSight if the sensor is not in contact with anything; hence,
we only include vision-touch pairs where the sensor touches
the objects. The model shall predict a reasonable touch
position based on the geometric cues from the touch images.

The Sense of Touch Different regions and objects can
stimulate similar senses of touch. For example, our ﬁnger

Figure 8. Visualizing the learned representations using Zhou et
al. [49] (a) and (b) visualize two internal units of our vision →
touch model. They both highlight the position of the GelSight,
but focus on sharp edges and ﬂat surfaces respectively. (c) and (d)
visualize internal units of our touch → vision model. They focus
on different geometric patterns.

may feel the same if we touch various regions on a ﬂat
surface or along the same sharp edge. Therefore, given a
tactile input, it is unrealistic to ask a model to predict the
exact same touch location as the ground truth. As long as the
model can predict a touch position that feels the same as the
ground truth position, it is still a valid prediction. To quantify
this, we show the predicted visual image as well as the
ground truth visual image. Then we ask human participants
whether these two touch locations feel similar or not. We
report average accuracies over 400 images per method (200
known objects, 200 unknown objects), and Table 3 shows
the performance of different methods. Our full method can
produce much more plausible touch positions.

We also compare our method with a baseline trained with
external supervisions provided by humans. Speciﬁcally, we
hand-label the position of the GelSight on 1,000 images, and
train a Stacked Hourglass Networks [31] to predict possible
touch positions. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons
are shown in Figure 5 and Table 3. Our self-supervised
method is comparable to its fully-supervised counterpart.

Perceptual Realism (AMT) Since it is difﬁcult for hu-
mans participants to imagine a robotic manipulation scene
given only a single tactile data, we only evaluate the quality
of results without showing the tactile input. In particular, we
show each image for 1 second, and AMT participants are
then given unlimited time to decide which one is fake. The
ﬁrst 10 images of each HITs are used for practice and we
give AMT participants the correct answer. The participants

Table 4. Touch2Vision AMT “real vs fake” test. Although
pix2pix achieves the highest score for unseen objects, it always
produces identical images due to mode collapse. Figure 5 shows
a typical collapsed mode, where pix2pix always places the arm at
the top-right corner of the image. More qualitative results can be
found in our supplementary material.

are then asked to ﬁnish the next 40 trials.

In total, we collect 8, 000 judgments for 1, 000 results.
Table 4 shows the fooling rate of each method. We note that
results from pix2pix [13] suffer from severe mode collapse
and always produce identical images, although they look
realistic according to AMT participants. See our website
for a more detailed comparison. We also observe that the
temporal cues do not always help improve the quality of
results for touch → vision direction as we only consider
vision-touch pairs during the moment of touch.

Visualizing the learned representation The visualiza-
tion of the learned representations (Figure 8c and d) show
two units that focus on different geometric cues. Please see
our supplemental material for more examples.

6. Discussion

In this work, we have proposed to draw connections be-
tween vision and touch with conditional adversarial net-
works. Humans heavily rely on both sensory modalities
when interacting with the world. Our model can produce
promising cross-modal prediction results for both known
objects and unseen objects. In the future, vision-touch cross-
modal connection may help downstream vision and robotics
applications, such as object recognition and grasping in a
low-light environment, and physical scene understanding.
