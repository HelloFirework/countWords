Abstract

Binaural audio provides a listener with 3D sound sen-
sation, allowing a rich perceptual experience of the scene.
However, binaural recordings are scarcely available and
require nontrivial expertise and equipment to obtain. We
propose to convert common monaural audio into binau-
ral audio by leveraging video. The key idea is that vi-
sual frames reveal signiﬁcant spatial cues that, while ex-
plicitly lacking in the accompanying single-channel au-
dio, are strongly linked to it. Our multi-modal approach
recovers this link from unlabeled video. We devise a
deep convolutional neural network that learns to decode
the monaural (single-channel) soundtrack into its binau-
ral counterpart by injecting visual information about ob-
ject and scene conﬁgurations. We call the resulting output
2.5D visual sound—the visual stream helps “lift” the ﬂat
single channel audio into spatialized sound. In addition to
sound generation, we show the self-supervised representa-
tion learned by our network beneﬁts audio-visual source
separation. Our video results: http://vision.cs.

1. Introduction

Multi-modal perception is essential to capture the rich-
ness of real-world sensory data and environments. People
perceive the world by combining a number of simultaneous
sensory streams, among which the visual and audio streams
are paramount.
In particular, both audio and visual data
convey signiﬁcant spatial information. We see where ob-
jects are and how the room is laid out. We also hear them:
sound-emitting objects indicate their location, and sound re-
verberations reveal the room’s main surfaces, materials, and
dimensions. Similarly, as in the famous cocktail party sce-
nario, while having a conversation at a noisy party, one can
hear another voice calling out and turn to face it. The two
senses naturally work in concert to interpret spatial signals.

Figure 1: Binaural audio creates a 3D soundscape for lis-
teners, but such recordings remain rare. The proposed ap-
proach infers 2.5D visual sound by injecting the spatial in-
formation contained in the video frames accompanying a
typical monaural audio stream.

The human auditory system uses two ears to extract indi-
vidual sound sources from a complex mixture. The duplex
theory proposed by Lord Rayleigh says that sound source
locations are mainly determined by time differences be-
tween the sounds reaching each ear (Interaural Time Dif-
ference, ITD) and differences in sound level entering the
ears (Interaural Level Difference, ILD) [37]. Accordingly,
to mimic human hearing, binaural audio is usually recorded
using two microphones attached to the two ears of a dummy
head (see Fig. 2). The rig’s two microphones, their spacing,
and the physical shape of the ears are all signiﬁcant for ap-
proximating how humans receive sound signals. As a result,
when playing binaural audio through headphones, listeners
feel the 3D sound sensation of being in the place where the
recording was made and can easily localize the sounds. The
immersive spatial sound is valuable for audiophiles, AR/VR
applications, and social video sharers alike.

However, binaural recordings are difﬁcult to obtain in
daily life due to the high price of the recording device and
the required expertise. Consumer-level cameras typically
only record monaural audio with a single microphone, or
stereo audio recorded using two microphones with arbi-
trary arrangement and without physical representation of
the pinna (outer ear). We contend that for both machines

limited dimension. Monaural audio collapses all indepen-
dent audio streams to the same spatial point, and the listener
cannot sense the spatial locations of the sound sources.

Our key insight is that video accompanying monaural au-
dio has the potential to unlock spatial sound, lifting a ﬂat au-
dio signal into what we call “2.5D visual sound”. Although
a single channel audio track alone does not encode any spa-
tial information, its accompanying visual frames do contain
object and scene conﬁgurations. For example, as shown in
Fig. 1, we observe from the video frame that a man is play-
ing the piano on the left and a man is playing the cello on the
right. Although we cannot sense the locations of the sound
sources by listening to the mono recording, we can nonethe-
less anticipate what we would hear if we were personally in
the scene by inference from the visual frames.

We introduce an approach to realize this intuition. Given
unlabeled training video, we devise a MONO2BINAURAL
deep convolutional neural network to convert monaural au-
dio to binaural audio by injecting the spatial cues embed-
ded in the visual frames. Our encoder-decoder style net-
work takes a mixed single-channel audio and its accompa-
nying visual frames as input to perform joint audio-visual
analysis, and attempts to predict a two-channel binaural au-
dio that agrees with the spatial conﬁgurations in the video.
When listening to the predicted binaural audio—the 2.5D
visual sound—listeners can then feel the locations of the
sound sources as they are displayed in the video.

Moreover, we show that apart from binaural audio gen-
eration, the MONO2BINAURAL conversion process can also
beneﬁt audio-visual source separation, a key challenge in
audio-visual analysis. State-of-the-art systems [13, 52, 31,
1, 10] aim to separate a mixed monaural audio record-
ing into its component sound sources, and thus far they
rely solely on the spatial cues evident in the visual stream.
We show that the proposed audio-visual binauralization can
self-supervise representation learning to elicit spatial sig-
nals relevant to separation from the audio stream as well.
Critically, gaining this new learning signal requires nei-
ther semantic annotations nor single-source data prepara-
tion, only the same unlabeled binaural training video.

Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we propose
to convert monaural audio to binaural audio by leverag-
ing video frames, and we design a MONO2BINAURAL deep
network to achieve that goal; Secondly, we collect FAIR-
Play, a 5.2 hour video dataset with binaural audio—the ﬁrst
dataset of its kind to facilitate research in both the audio
and vision communities; Thirdly, we propose to perform
audio-visual source separation on predicted binaural audio,
and show that it provides a useful self-supervised represen-
tation for the separation task. We validate our approach
on four challenging datasets spanning a variety of sound
sources (e.g., instruments, street scenes, travel, sports).

2. Related Work

Generating Sounds from Video Recent work explores
ways to generate audio conditioned on “silent” video. Ma-
terial properties are revealed by the sounds objects make
when hit with a drumstick, and can be used to syn-
thesize new sounds from silent videos [32]. Recurrent
networks [53] or conditional generative adversarial net-
works [7] can generate audio for input video frames, while
powerful simulators can synthesize audio-visual data for 3D
shapes [51]. Rather than generate audio from scratch, our
task entails converting an input one-channel audio to two-
channel binaural audio guided by the visual frames.

Only limited prior work considers video-based audio
spatialization [26, 28]. The system of [26] synthesizes
sound from a speaker in a room as a function of viewing an-
gle, but assumes access to an acoustic impulse recorded in
the speciﬁc room of interest, which restricts practical use,
e.g., for novel “off-the-shelf” videos. Concurrent work to
ours [28] generates ambisonics (audio for the full viewing
sphere) given 360◦ video and its mono audio. In contrast,
we focus on normal ﬁeld of view (NFOV) video and bin-
aural audio. We show that directly predicting binaural au-
dio creates better 3D sound sensations for listeners without
being restricted to 360◦ videos. Moreover, while the end
goal of [28] is audio spatialization, we also demonstrate
that our MONO2BINAURAL conversion process aids audio-
visual source separation.

Audio(-Visual) Source Separation Audio-only source
separation has been extensively studied in the signal pro-
cessing literature. “Blind” separation tackles the case where
only a single channel is available [42, 43, 46, 19]. Separa-
tion becomes easier when multiple channels are observed
using multiple microphones [29, 49, 9] or binaural au-
dio [48, 8, 50].
Inspired by this, we transform mono to
binaural by observing video, and then leverage the result-
ing representation to improve audio-visual separation.

Audio-visual source separation also has a rich history,
with methods exploring mutual information [11], subspace
analysis [41, 35], matrix factorization [34, 39, 13], and cor-
related onsets [6, 25]. Recent methods leverage deep learn-
ing for audio-visual separation of speech [10, 31, 1, 12],
musical instruments [52], and other objects [13]. New tasks
are also emerging, such as learning to separate on- and off-
screen sounds [31], learning object sound models from un-
labeled video [13], or predicting sounds per pixel [52]. All
these methods exploit mono audio cues to perform audio-
visual source separation, whereas we propose to predict bin-
aural cues to enhance separation. Furthermore, different
from the task of localizing pixels responsible for a given
sound [21, 18, 54, 3, 52, 40, 44], our goal is to perform
binaural audio synthesis.

Self-Supervised Learning Self-supervised learning ex-
ploits labels freely available in the structure of the data,
and audio-visual data offers a wealth of such tasks. Re-
cent work explores self-supervision for visual [33, 2]
and audio [4] feature learning, cross-modal representa-
tions [5], and audio-visual alignment [31, 23, 16]. Our
MONO2BINAURAL formulation is also self-supervised, but
unlike any of the above, we use visual frames to supervise
audio spatialization, while also learning better sound repre-
sentations for audio-visual source separation.

3. Approach

Our approach learns to map monaural audio to binaural
audio via video. In the following, we ﬁrst describe our bin-
aural audio video dataset (Sec. 3.1). Then we present our
MONO2BINAURAL formulation (Sec. 3.2), and our network
and training procedure to solve it (Sec. 3.3). Finally we in-
troduce our approach to leverage inferred binaural sound to
perform audio-visual source separation (Sec. 3.4).

3.1. FAIR Play Data Collection

Training our method requires binaural audio and accom-
panying video. Since no large public video datasets contain
binaural audio, we collect a new dataset we call FAIR-Play
with a custom rig. As shown in Fig. 2, we assembled a
rig consisting of a 3Dio Free Space XLR binaural micro-
phone, a GoPro HERO6 Black camera, and a Tascam DR-
60D recorder as the audio pre-ampliﬁer. We mounted the
GoPro camera on top of the 3Dio binaural microphone to
mimic a person’s embodiment for seeing and hearing, re-
spectively. The 3Dio binaural microphone records binaural
audio, and the GoPro camera records videos at 30fps with
stereo audio. We simultaneously record from both devices
so the streams are roughly aligned.

Note that both the ear shaped housing (pinnae) for the
microphones and their spatial separation are signiﬁcant;
professional binaural mics like 3Dio simulate the physical
manner in which humans receive sound. In contrast, stereo
sound is captured by two mics with an arbitrary separation
that varies across capture devices (phones, cameras), and so
lacks the spatial nuances of binaural. The limit of binaural
capture, however, is that a single rig inherently assumes a
single head-related transfer function, whereas individuals
have slight variations due to inter-person anatomical differ-
ences. Personalizing head-related transfer functions is an
area of active research [20, 45].

We captured videos with our custom rig in a large music
room (about 1,000 square feet). Our intent was to capture a
variety of sound making objects in a variety of spatial con-
texts, by assembling different combinations of instruments
and people in the room. The room contains various instru-
ments including cello, guitar, drum, ukelele, harp, piano,
trumpet, upright bass, and banjo. We recruited 20 volun-

teers to play and recorded them in solo, duet, and multi-
player performances. We post-process the raw data into 10s
clips. In the end, our FAIR-Play1 dataset consists of 1,871
short clips of musical performances, totaling 5.2 hours. In
experiments we use both the music data as well as ambison-
ics datasets [28] for street scenes and YouTube videos of
sports, travel, etc. (cf. Sec. 4).

3.2. Mono2Binaural Formulation

Binaural cues let us infer the location of sound sources.
The interaural time difference (ITD) and the interaural level
difference (ILD) play an essential role. ITD is caused by the
difference in travel distances between the two ears. When
a sound source is closer to one ear than the other, there is
a time delay between the signals’ arrival at the two ears.
ILD is caused by a “shadowing” effect—a listener’s head is
large relative to certain wavelengths of sound, so it serves
as a barrier, creating a shadow. The particular shape of the
head, pinnae, and torso also act as a ﬁlter depending on the
locations of the sound sources (distance, azimuth, and ele-
vation). All these cues are missing in monaural audio, thus
we cannot sense any spatial effect by listening to single-
channel audio.

We denote the signal received at the left and right ears
by xL(t) and xR(t), respectively. If we mix the two channels
into a single channel xM(t) = xL(t) + xR(t), then all spatial
information collapses. We can formulate a self-supervised
task to take the mixed monaural signal xM(t) as input and
split it into two separate channels ˜xL(t) and ˜xR(t), using the
original xL(t), xR(t) as ground-truth during training. How-
ever, this is a highly under-constrained problem, as xM(t)

and predicts a two-channel binaural audio output that satisﬁes the visual spatial conﬁgurations. An ImageNet pre-trained
ResNet-18 network is used to extract visual features, and a U-NET is used to extract audio features and perform joint audio-
visual analysis. We predict a complex mask for the audio difference signal, then combine it with the input mono audio to

lacks the necessary information to recover both channels.
Our key idea is to guide the MONO2BINAURAL process with
the accompanying video frames, from which visual spatial
information can serve as supervision.

Instead of directly predicting the two channels, we pre-

dict the difference of the two channels:

xD(t) = xL(t) − xR(t).

(1)

More speciﬁcally, we operate on the frequency domain
and perform short-time Fourier transform (STFT) [15] on
xM(t) to obtain the complex-valued spectrogram XM, and
the objective is to predict the complex-valued spectrogram
XD for xD(t):

XM = {XM

t=1, f =1, XD = {XD

t=1, f =1,

where t and f are the time frame and frequency bin indices,
respectively, and T and F are the numbers of bins. Then we
obtain the predicted difference signal ˜xD(t) by the inverse
short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT) [15] of XD. Finally,
we recover both channels—the binaural audio output:

˜xL(t) =

xM(t) + ˜xD(t)

˜xR(t) =

3.3. Mono2Binaural Network

Next we present our MONO2BINAURAL deep network to
perform audio spatialization. The network takes the mono
audio xM(t) and visual frames as input and predicts xD(t).

As shown in Fig. 3, we extract visual features from the
center frame of the audio segment using ResNet-18 [17],
which is pre-trained on ImageNet. The ResNet-18 network
extracts per-frame features after the 4th ResNet block with
size (H/32) × (W /32) ×C, where H,W,C denote the frame
and channel dimensions. We then pass the visual feature

through a 1 × 1 convolution layer to reduce the channel di-
mension, and ﬂatten it into a single visual feature vector.

On the audio side, we adopt a U-NET [38] style architec-
ture. The U-NET encoder-decoder network adopted here is
ideal for our dense prediction task where the input and out-
put have the same dimension. We mix the left and right
channels of the binaural audio, and extract a sequence of
STFT frames to generate an audio spectrogram XM. We use
the complex spectrogram: each time-frequency bin contains
the real and imaginary part of the corresponding complex
spectrogram value. Then it is passed through a series of
convolution layers to extract an audio feature of dimension
(T /32)×(F/32)×C. We replicate the visual feature vector
(T /32)×(F/32) times, tile them to match the audio feature
dimension, and then concatenate the audio and visual fea-
ture maps along the channel dimension. Through the series
of operations, each audio feature dimension is injected with
the visual feature to perform joint audio-visual analysis.

Finally, we perform up-convolutions on the concatenated
audio-visual feature map to generate a complex multiplica-
tive spectrogram mask M. In source separation tasks, spec-
trogram masks have proven better than alternatives such as
direct prediction of spectrograms or raw waveforms [47].
Similarly, here we also adopt the idea of masking, but our
goal is to mask the spectrogram of the mixed mono au-
dio and predict the spectrogram of the difference signal,
rather than perform separation. The real and imaginary
components of the complex mask are separately estimated
in the real domain. We add a sigmoid layer after the up-
convolution layers to bound the complex mask values to [-
1, 1], similar to [10]. The series of convolutions and up-
convolutions maps the input mono spectrogram to a com-
plex mask that encodes the predicted binaural audio.

Initially, we attempted to directly predict the left and
right channels. However, we found that direct prediction

ResNet-181x1 convreshapeSTFTleftrightmixed        tileconcatenateISTFTpredicted right channelpredicted left channelcomplex maskvisual featuremakes the network fall back on a “safe” but useless solu-
tion of copying and pasting the input audio, without reason-
ing with the visual features. Instead, predicting the differ-
ence signal forces the deep network to analyze the visual
information and learn the subtle difference between the two
channels, as required by the binaural audio target.

The spectrogram of the difference signal is then obtained
by complex multiplying the input spectrogram with the pre-
dicted complex mask:

˜X

D = M · XM.

(4)

We train our MONO2BINAURAL network using L2 loss to
minimize the distance between the ground-truth complex
spectrogram and the predicted one. Finally, using ISTFT,
we obtain the predicted difference signal ˜xD(t), through
which we recover the two channels ˜xL(t) and ˜xR(t) as de-
ﬁned in Eq. 3. See supp. for network details.

At test time, the network is presented with monaural au-
dio and a video frame and infers the binaural output, i.e.,
the 2.5D visual sound. To process a full video stream,
each video is decomposed into many short audio segments.
Video frames usually do not change much within such a
short segment. We use a sliding window to perform spa-
tialization segment by segment with a small hop size, and
average predictions on overlapping parts. Thus, our method
is able to handle moving sound sources and cameras.

Our approach expects a similar ﬁeld of view (FoV) be-
tween training and testing, and assumes the microphone is
near the camera. Our experiments demonstrate we can learn
MONO2BINAURAL for both normal FoV and 360◦ video,
and furthermore the same system can cope with mono in-
puts from variable hardware (e.g., YouTube videos).

3.4. Audio Visual Source Separation

So far we have deﬁned our MONO2BINAURAL approach
to convert monaural audio to binaural audio by introducing
visual spatial cues from video. Recall that we have two
goals: to predict binaural audio for sound generation itself,
and to explore its utility for audio-visual source separation.
Audio source separation is the problem of obtaining an
estimate for each of the J sources s j from the observed lin-
ear mixture x(t) = ∑J
j=1 s j(t). For binaural audio source
separation, the problem is to obtain an estimate for each of
the J sources s j from the observed binaural mixture xL(t)
and xR(t):

Interfering sound sources are often located at different
spatial positions in the physical space. Human listeners
exploit the spatial information from the coordination of
both ears to resolve sound ambiguity caused by multiple

we mix the binaural audio tracks for a pair of videos to gen-
erate a mixed audio input. The network learns to separate

sources. This ability is greatly diminished when listen-
ing with only one ear, especially in reverberant environ-
ments [22]. Audio source separation by machine listeners is
similarly handicapped, typically lacking access to binaural
audio [52, 13, 31, 10]. However, we hypothesize that our
MONO2BINAURAL predicted binaural audio can aid sepa-
ration. Intuitively, by forcing the network to learn how to
lift mono audio to binaural, its representation is encouraged
to expose the very spatial cues that are valuable for source
separation. Thus, even though the MONO2BINAURAL fea-
tures see the same video as any other audio-visual separa-
tion method, they may better decode the latent spatial cues
because of their binauralization “pre-training” task.

In particular, we expect two main effects. First, binau-
ral audio embeds information about the spatial distribution
of sound sources, which can act as a regularizer for sep-
aration. Second, binaural cues may be especially helpful
in cases where sound sources have similar acoustic char-
acteristics, since the spatial organization can reduce source
ambiguities. Related regularization effects are observed in
other vision tasks. For example, hallucinating motion en-
hances static-image action recognition [14], or predicting
semantic segmentation informs depth estimation [27].

To implement a testbed for audio-visual source separa-
tion, we adopt the Mix-and-Separate idea [52, 31, 10]. We
use the same base architecture as our MONO2BINAURAL
network except that now the input to the network is a pair of
training video clips. Fig. 4 illustrates the separation frame-
work. We mix the sounds of the predicted binaural audio
for the two videos to generate a complex audio input sig-
nal, and the learning objective is to separate the binaural
audio for each video conditioned on their corresponding vi-
sual frames. Following [52], we only use spectrogram mag-
nitude and predict a ratio mask for separation. Per-pixel L1
loss is used for training. See supp. for details.

4.3. Mono2Binaural Generation Accuracy

We validate our approach for generation and separation.

4.1. Datasets

We use four challenging datasets spanning a wide vari-
ety of sound sources, including musical instruments, street
scenes, travel, and sports.

FAIR-Play Our new dataset consists of 1,871 10s clips
of videos recorded in a music room (Fig. 2). The videos
are paired with binaural audios of high quality recorded
by a professional binaural microphone. We create 10 ran-
dom splits by splitting the data into train/val/test splits of
1,497/187/187 clips, respectively.

REC-STREET A dataset collected by [28] using a Theta
V 360◦ camera with TA-1 spatial audio microphone. It con-
sists of 43 videos (3.5 hours) of outdoor street scenes.

in-the-wild 360◦
YT-CLEAN This dataset contains
videos from YouTube crawled by [28] using queries related
to spatial audio. It consists of 496 videos of a small num-
ber of super-imposed sources, such as people talking in a
meeting room, outdoor sports, etc.

YT-MUSIC A dataset
that consists of 397 YouTube
videos of music performances collected by [28]. It is their
most challenging dataset due to the large number of mixed
sources (voices and instruments).

To our knowledge, FAIR-Play is the ﬁrst dataset of its
kind that contains videos of professional recorded binaural
audio. For REC-STREET, YT-CLEAN and YT-MUSIC,
we split the videos into 10s clips and divide them into
train/val/test splits based on the provided split1. These
datasets only contain ambisonics, so we use a binaural de-
coder to convert them to binaural audio. Speciﬁcally, we use
the head related transfer function (HRTF) from NH2 sub-
ject in the ARI HRTF Dataset2 to perform decoding. For
our FAIR-Play dataset, half of the training data is used to
train the MONO2BINAURAL network, and the other half is
reserved for audio-visual source separation experiments.

4.2. Implementation Details

Both our MONO2BINAURAL and separation networks are
in PyTorch. For all experiments, we resample the audio at
16kHz and STFT is computed using a Hann window of
length 25ms, hop length of 10ms, and FFT size of 512.
For MONO2BINAURAL training, we randomly sample audio
segments of length 0.63s from each 10s audio clip. During
testing, we use a sliding window with hop size 0.05s to bin-
auralize 10s audio clips for both our method and baselines.
For source separation experiments, we use similar network
design and training/testing strategies. See supp. for details.

2http://www.kfs.oeaw.ac.at/hrtf

We evaluate the quality of our predicted binaural audio
by using common metrics as well as two user studies. We
compare to the following baselines:

• Ambisonics [28]: We use the pre-trained models pro-
vided by [28] to predict ambisonics. The models are
trained on the same data as our method. Then we use
the binaural decoder to convert the predicted ambison-
ics to binaural audio. This baseline is not available for
the BINAURAL-MUSIC-ROOM dataset.

• Audio-Only: To determine if visual information is es-
sential to perform MONO2BINAURAL conversion, we
remove the visual stream and implement a baseline us-
ing only audio as input. All other settings are the same
except that only audio features are passed to the up-
convolution layers for binaural audio prediction.

• Flipped-Visual: During testing, we ﬂip the accompa-
nying visual frames of the mono audios to perform pre-
diction using the wrong visual information.

• Mono-Mono: A straightforward baseline that copies
the mixed monaural audio onto both channels to create
a fake binaural audio.

We report two metrics: 1) STFT Distance: The eu-
clidean distance between the ground-truth and predicted
complex spectrograms of the left and right channels:

D{STFT} = ||XL − ˜X

L||2 + ||XR − ˜X

R||2.

2) Envelope (ENV) Distance: Direct comparison of raw
waveforms may not capture perceptual similarity well. Fol-
lowing [28], we take the envelope of the signals, and mea-
sure the euclidean distance between the envelopes of the
ground-truth left and right channels and the predicted sig-
nals. Let E[x(t)] denote the envelope of signal x(t). The
envelope distance is deﬁned as:

D{ENV} = ||E[xL(t)] − E[ ˜xL(t)||2 + ||E[xR(t)] − E[ ˜xR(t)||2.

Results. Table 1 shows the binaural generation results.
Our method outperforms all baselines consistently on all
four datasets. Our MONO2BINAURAL approach performs
better than the Audio-Only baseline, indicating the visual
stream is essential to guide conversion. Note that the Audio-
Only baseline uses the same network design as our method,
so it has reasonably good performance. Still, we ﬁnd our
method outperforms it most when object(s) are not simply
located in the center. Flipped-Visual performs much worse,
demonstrating that our network properly learns to localize
sound sources to predict binaural audio correctly.

The Ambisonics [28] approach does not do as well. We
hypothesize several reasons. The method predicts four
channel ambisonics directly, which must be converted to

Table 1: Quantitative results of binaural audio prediction on four diverse datasets. We report the STFT distance and the
envelope distance; lower is better. For FAIR-Play, we report the average results across 10 random splits. The results have a
standard error of approximately 5 × 10−2 for STFT distance and 3 × 10−3 for ENV distance on average.

User studies. Having quantiﬁed the advantage of our
method in Table 1, we now report real user studies. To test
how well the predicted binaural audio makes a listener feel
the 3D sensation, we conduct two user studies.

For the ﬁrst study, the participants listen to a 10s ground-
truth binaural audio and see the visual frame. Then they
listen to two predicted binaural audios generated by our
method and a baseline (Ambisonics, Audio-Only, or Mono-
Mono). After listening to each pair, participants are asked
which of the two creates a better 3D sensation that matches
the ground-truth binaural audio. We recruited 18 partici-
pants with normal hearing. Each listened to 45 pairs span-
ning all the datasets. Fig. 5a shows the results. We report
the percentage of times each method is chosen as the pre-
ferred one. We can see that the binaural audio generated by
our method creates a more realistic 3D sensation.

For the second user study, we ask participants to name
the direction they hear a particular sound coming from.
Using the FAIR-Play data, we randomly select 10 in-
strument video clips where some player is located in the
left/center/right of the visual frames. We ask every partic-
ipant to only listen to the ground-truth or predicted binau-
ral audio from our method or a baseline, and then choose
the direction the sound of a speciﬁed instrument is coming
from. Note that for this study, we input real mono audio
recorded by the GoPro mic for binaural audio prediction.
Fig. 5b shows the results from the 18 participants. The true
recorded binaural audio is of high quality, and the listeners
can often easily perceive the correct direction. However,
our predicted binaural audio also clearly conveys direction-
ality. Compared to the baselines, ours presents listeners a
much more accurate spatial audio experience.

4.4. Localizing the Sound Sources

Does the network attend to the locations of the sound
sources when performing binauralization? As a byproduct
of our MONO2BINAURAL training, we can use the network
to perform sound source localization. We use a mask of size
32 × 32 to replace image regions with image mean values,
and forward the masked frame through the network to pre-
dict binaural audio. Then we compute the loss, and repeat

binaural audio. While ambisonics have the advantage of be-
ing a more general audio representation that is ideal for 360◦
video, predicting ambisonics ﬁrst and then decoding to bin-
aural audio for deployment can introduce artifacts that make
the binaural audio less realistic. Better head-related transfer
functions could help to render more realistic binaural audio
from ambisonics, but this remains active research [30, 24].3
Furthermore, manually inspecting the results, we ﬁnd that
the decoded binaural audio by [28] conveys spatial sensa-
tion, but it is less accurate and stable than our method. Our
approach directly formulates the audio spatialization prob-
lem in terms of the two-channel binaural audio that listeners
ultimately hear, which yields better accuracy.

Our video results4 show qualitative results including fail-
ure cases. Our system can fail when there are multiple
objects of similar appearance, e.g. multiple human speak-
ers. Our model incorrectly spatializes the audio, because
the people are too visually similar. However, when there
is only one human speaker amidst other sounds, it can suc-
cessfully perform audio spatialization. Future work incor-
porating motion may beneﬁt instance-level spatialization.

3We experimented with multiple ambisonics-binaural decoding solu-

tions and report the best results for [28] in Table 1.

by placing the mask at different locations of the frame. Fi-
nally, we highlight the regions which, when replaced, lead
to the largest losses. They are considered the most impor-
tant regions for MONO2BINAURAL conversion, and are ex-
pected to align with sound sources.

Fig. 6 shows examples. The highlighted key regions cor-
relate quite well with sound sources. They are usually the
instruments playing in the music room, the moving cars in
street scenes, the place where an activity is going on, etc.
The ﬁnal row shows some failure cases. The model can
be confused when there are multiple similar instruments in
view, or silent or noisy scenes. Sound sources in YT-Clean
and YT-Music are especially difﬁcult to spatialize and lo-
calize due to diverse and/or large number of sound sources.

4.5. Audio Visual Source Separation

Having demonstrated our predicted binaural audio cre-
ates a better 3D sensation, we now examine its impact on
audio-visual source separation using the FAIR-Play dataset.
The dataset contains object-level sounds of diverse sound
making objects (instruments), which is well-suited for the
Mix-and-Separate audio-visual source separation approach
we adopt. We train on the held-out data of FAIR-Play, and
test on 10 typical single-instrument video clips from the
val/test set, with each representing one unique instrument
in our dataset. We pairwise mix each video clip and per-
form separation, for a total of 45 test videos.

In addition to the ground truth binaural (upper bound)
and the Mono-Mono baseline deﬁned above, we compare
to a Mono baseline that takes monaural audio as input and
separates monaural audios for each source. Mono repre-
sents the current norm of performing audio-visual source
separation using only single-channel audio [52, 13, 31]. We
stress that all other aspects of the networks are the same, so
that any differences in performance can be attributed to our
binauralization self-supervision. To evaluate source sepa-
ration quality, we use the widely used mir eval library [36],
and the standard metrics: Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR),
Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR), and Signal-to-Artifact
Ratio (SAR). Table 2 shows the results. We obtain large
gains by inferring binaural audio. The inferred binaural
audio offers a more informative audio representation com-
pared to the original monaural audio, leading to cleaner sep-
aration. See supp. video4 for examples.

5. Conclusion

We presented an approach to convert single channel au-
dio into binaural audio by leveraging object/scene conﬁg-
urations in the visual frames. The predicted 2.5D visual
sound offers a more immersive audio experience. Our
MONO2BINAURAL framework achieves state-of-the-art per-
formance on audio spatialization. Moreover, using the pre-
dicted binaural audio as a better audio representation, we
boost a modern model for audio-visual source separation.
Generating binaural audio for off-the-shelf video can poten-
tially close the gap between transporting audio and visual
experiences, enabling new applications in VR/AR. As fu-
ture work, we plan to explore ways to incorporate object lo-
calization and motion, and explicitly model scene sounds.
