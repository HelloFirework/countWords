Figure 1: VCR: Given an image, a list of regions, and a question, a model must answer the question and provide a ratio-
nale explaining why its answer is right. Our questions challenge computer vision systems to go beyond recognition-level
understanding, towards a higher-order cognitive and commonsense understanding of the world depicted by the image.

Abstract

Visual understanding goes well beyond object recogni-
tion. With one glance at an image, we can eﬀortlessly imag-
ine the world beyond the pixels: for instance, we can infer
people’s actions, goals, and mental states. While this task
is easy for humans, it is tremendously diﬃcult for today’s
vision systems, requiring higher-order cognition and com-
monsense reasoning about the world. We formalize this task
as Visual Commonsense Reasoning. Given a challenging
question about an image, a machine must answer correctly
and then provide a rationale justifying its answer.

Next, we introduce a new dataset, VCR, consisting of
290k multiple choice QA problems derived from 110k movie
scenes. The key recipe for generating non-trivial and high-
quality problems at scale is Adversarial Matching, a new
approach to transform rich annotations into multiple choice
questions with minimal bias. Experimental results show

that while humans ﬁnd VCR easy (over 90% accuracy),
state-of-the-art vision models struggle (∼45%).

To move towards cognition-level understanding, we
present a new reasoning engine, Recognition to Cogni-
tion Networks (R2C), that models the necessary layered in-
ferences for grounding, contextualization, and reasoning.
R2C helps narrow the gap between humans and machines
(∼65%); still, the challenge is far from solved, and we pro-
vide analysis that suggests avenues for future work.

1. Introduction

With one glance at an image, we can immediately infer
what is happening in the scene beyond what is visually ob-
vious. For example, in the top image of Figure 1, not only
do we see several objects (people, plates, and cups), we can
also reason about the entire situation: three people are din-
ing together, they have already ordered their food before

the photo has been taken, [person3
not eating with them, and what [person1
] ordered are
the pancakes and bacon (as opposed to the cheesecake), be-
cause [person4
] while
looking at the server, [person3

] is pointing to [person1

] .

Visual understanding requires seamless integration be-
tween recognition and cognition: beyond recognition-level
perception (e.g., detecting objects and their attributes),
one must perform cognition-level reasoning (e.g., inferring
the likely intents, goals, and social dynamics of people)
[13]. State-of-the-art vision systems can reliably perform
recognition-level image understanding, but struggle with
complex inferences, like those in Figure 1. We argue that as
the ﬁeld has made signiﬁcant progress on recognition-level
building blocks, such as object detection, pose estimation,
and segmentation, now is the right time to tackle cognition-
level reasoning at scale.

As a critical step toward complete visual understanding,
we present the task of Visual Commonsense Reasoning.
Given an image, a machine must answer a question that re-
quires a thorough understanding of the visual world evoked
by the image. Moreover, the machine must provide a ratio-
nale justifying why that answer is true, referring to the de-
tails of the scene, as well as background knowledge about
how the world works. These questions, answers, and ratio-
nales are expressed using a mixture of rich natural language
as well as explicit references to image regions. To support
clean-cut evaluation, all our tasks are framed as multiple
choice QA.

Our new dataset for this task, VCR, is the ﬁrst of its
kind and is large-scale — 290k pairs of questions, answers,
and rationales, over 110k unique movie scenes. A crucial
challenge in constructing a dataset of this complexity at
this scale is how to avoid annotation artifacts. A recurring
challenge in most recent QA datasets has been that human-
written answers contain unexpected but distinct biases that
models can easily exploit. Often these biases are so promi-
nent so that models can select the right answers without
even looking at the questions [28, 61, 72].

Thus, we present Adversarial Matching, a novel QA
assignment algorithm that allows for robust multiple-choice
dataset creation at scale. The key idea is to recycle each cor-
rect answer for a question exactly three times — as a neg-
ative answer for three other questions. Each answer thus
has the same probability (25%) of being correct:
this re-
solves the issue of answer-only biases, and disincentivizes
machines from always selecting the most generic answer.
We formulate the answer recycling problem as a constrained
optimization based on the relevance and entailment scores
between each candidate negative answer and the gold an-
swer, as measured by state-of-the-art natural language in-
ference models [10, 57, 15]. A neat feature of our recycling
algorithm is a knob that can control the tradeoﬀ between

human and machine diﬃculty: we want the problems to be
hard for machines while easy for humans.

Narrowing the gap between recognition- and cognition-
level image understanding requires grounding the meaning
of the natural language passage in the visual data, under-
standing the answer in the context of the question, and rea-
soning over the shared and grounded understanding of the
question, the answer, the rationale and the image. In this
paper we introduce a new model, Recognition to Cogni-
tion Networks (R2C). Our model performs three inference
steps. First, it grounds the meaning of a natural language
passage with respect to the image regions (objects) that are
directly referred to. It then contextualizes the meaning of an
answer with respect to the question that was asked, as well
as the global objects not mentioned. Finally, it reasons over
this shared representation to arrive at an answer.

Experiments on VCR show that R2C greatly outper-
forms state-of-the-art visual question-answering systems:
obtaining 65% accuracy at question answering, 67% at an-
swer justiﬁcation, and 44% at staged answering and justiﬁ-
cation. Still, the task and dataset is far from solved: humans
score roughly 90% on each. We provide detailed insights
and an ablation study to point to avenues for future research.
In sum, our major contributions are fourfold: (1) we for-
malize a new task, Visual Commonsense Reasoning, and
(2) present a large-scale multiple-choice QA dataset, VCR,
(3) that is automatically assigned using Adversarial Match-
ing, a new algorithm for robust multiple-choice dataset cre-
ation. (4) We also propose a new model, R2C, that aims
to mimic the layered inferences from recognition to cogni-
tion; this also establishes baseline performance on our new
challenge. The dataset is available to download, along with
code for our model, at visualcommonsense.com.

2. Task Overview

We present VCR, a new task that challenges vision sys-
tems to holistically and cognitively understand the con-
in Figure 1, we need
tent of an image. For instance,
] is delivering
to understand the activities ( [person3
food), the roles of people ( [person1
] is a customer
who previously ordered food), the mental states of people
( [person1
] wants to eat), and the likely events before
and after the scene ( [person3
] will serve the pancakes
next). Our task covers these categories and more: a distri-
bution of the inferences required is in Figure 2.

Visual understanding requires not only answering ques-
tions correctly, but doing so for the right reasons. We thus
require a model to give a rationale that explains why its
answer is true. Our questions, answers, and rationales are
written in a mixture of rich natural language as well as de-
tection tags, like ‘ [person2
this helps to provide
an unambiguous link between the textual description of an

] ’:

sunglasses inside?
What are [person1] and 
[person2] doing?

What will [person6] do after 
unpacking the groceries?
What is [person3] thinking while 
[person5] shakes his hand?

What is [person1]’s relation to 
[person4]?

Where is [person1] now?

What would happen if 
[person3] fell asleep?

Figure 2: Overview of the types of inference required by
questions in VCR. Of note, 38% of the questions are ex-
planatory ‘why’ or ‘how’ questions, 24% involve cognition-
level activities, and 13% require temporal reasoning (i.e.,
what might come next). These categories are not mutually
exclusive; an answer might require several hops of diﬀerent
types of inferences (see appendix Sec A).

object (‘the man on the left in the white shirt’) and the cor-
responding image region.

To make evaluation straightforward, we frame our ul-
timate task – of staged answering and justiﬁcation – in a
multiple-choice setting. Given a question along with four
answer choices, a model must ﬁrst select the right answer.
If its answer was correct, then it is provided four rationale
choices (that could purportedly justify its correct answer),
and it must select the correct rationale. We call this Q→AR
as for the model prediction to be correct requires both the
chosen answer and then the chosen rationale to be correct.
Our task can be decomposed into two multiple-choice
sub-tasks, that correspond to answering (Q→A) and justiﬁ-
cation (QA→R) respectively:

Deﬁnition VCR subtask. A single example of a

VCR subtask consists of an image I, and:

• A sequence o of object detections. Each object detec-
tion oi consists of a bounding box b, a segmentation
mask m1, and a class label `i ∈ L.

• A query q, posed using a mix of natural language and
pointing. Each word qi in the query is either a word in
a vocabulary V, or is a tag referring to an object in o.
• A set of N responses, where each response r(i) is writ-
ten in the same manner as the query: with natural lan-
guage and pointing. Exactly one response is correct.

The model chooses a single (best) response.

In question-answering (Q→A), the query is the question and
the responses are answer choices.
In answer justiﬁcation
(QA→R), the query is the concatenated question and correct
answer, while the responses are rationale choices.

1The task is agnostic to the representation of the mask, but it could
be thought of as a list of polygons p, with each polygon consisting of a
sequence of 2d vertices inside the box p j = {xt, yt}t.

In this paper, we evaluate models in terms of accuracy
and use N=4 responses. Baseline accuracy on each subtask
is then 25% (1/N). In the holistic setting (Q→AR), baseline
accuracy is 6.25% (1/N2) as there are two subtasks.

3. Data Collection

In this section, we describe how we collect the ques-
tions, correct answers and correct rationales for VCR. Our
key insight – towards collecting commonsense visual rea-
soning problems at scale – is to carefully select interesting
situations. We thus extract still images from movie clips.
The images from these clips describe complex situations
that humans can decipher without additional context: for in-
stance, in Figure 1, we know that [person3
] will serve
[person1
] pancakes, whereas a machine might not un-
derstand this unless it sees the entire clip.

Interesting and Diverse Situations To ensure diver-
sity, we make no limiting assumptions about the predeﬁned
set of actions. Rather than searching for predeﬁned labels,
which can introduce search engine bias [76, 16, 20], we
collect images from movie scenes. The underlying scenes
come from the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge
[67] and YouTube movie clips.2 To avoid simple images,
we train and apply an ‘interestingness ﬁlter’ (e.g. a closeup
of a syringe in Figure 3).3

We center our task around challenging questions requir-
ing cognition-level reasoning. To make these cognition-
level questions simple to ask, and to avoid the clunkiness
of referring expressions, VCR’s language integrates object
tags ( [person2
] ) and explicitly excludes referring ex-
pressions (‘the woman on the right.’) These object tags are
detected from Mask-RCNN [29, 24], and the images are ﬁl-
tered so as to have at least three high-conﬁdence tags.

Crowdsourcing Quality Annotations Workers on
Amazon Mechanical Turk were given an image with de-
tections, along with additional context in the form of video
captions.4 They then ask one to three questions about the
image; for each question, they provide a reasonable answer
and a rationale. To ensure top-tier work, we used a system
of quality checks and paid our workers well.5

The result is an underlying dataset with high agreement
and diversity of reasoning. Our dataset contains a myriad of
interesting commonsense phenomena (Figure 2) and a great
diversity in terms of unique examples (Supp Section A); al-
most every answer and rationale is unique.

ing CNN features and detection statistics, details in the appendix, Sec B.

what will happen next.

Figure 3: An overview of the construction of VCR. Using a state-of-the-art object detector [29, 24], we identify the objects
in each image. The most interesting images are passed to crowd workers, along with scene-level context in the form of scene
descriptions (MovieClips) and video captions (LSMDC, [67]). The crowd workers use a combination of natural language
and detection tags to ask and answer challenging visual questions, also providing a rationale justifying their answer.

4. Adversarial Matching

We cast VCR as a four-way multiple choice task, to
avoid the evaluation diﬃculties of language generation or
captioning tasks where current metrics often prefer incor-
rect machine-written text over correct human-written text
[49]. However,
it is not obvious how to obtain high-
quality incorrect choices, or counterfactuals, at scale. While
past work has asked humans to write several counterfactual
choices for each correct answer [75, 46], this process is ex-
pensive. Moreover, it has the potential of introducing anno-
tation artifacts: subtle patterns that are by themselves highly
predictive of the ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ label [72, 28, 61].

In this work, we propose Adversarial Matching: a new
method that allows for any ‘language generation’ dataset to
be turned into a multiple choice test, while requiring mini-
mal human involvement. An overview is shown in Figure 4.
Our key insight is that the problem of obtaining good coun-
terfactuals can be broken up into two subtasks: the counter-
factuals must be as relevant as possible to the context (so
that they appeal to machines), while they cannot be overly
similar to the correct response (so that they don’t become
correct answers incidentally). We balance between these
two objectives to create a dataset that is challenging for ma-
chines, yet easy for humans.

Formally, our procedure requires two models: one to
compute the relevance between a query and a response, Prel,
and another to compute the similarity between two response
choices, Psim. Here, we employ state-of-the-art models for
Natural Language Inference: BERT [15] and ESIM+ELMo
[10, 57], respectively.6
Then, given dataset examples
(qi, ri)1≤i≤N , we obtain a counterfactual for each qi by per-
forming maximum-weight bipartite matching [55, 40] on a
weight matrix W ∈ RN×N , given by

Wi, j = log(Prel(qi, r j)) +   log(1 − Psim(ri, r j)).

Incorrect
choices are obtained via maximum-weight bipartite match-
ing between queries and responses; the weights are scores
from state-of-the-art natural language inference models.
Assigned responses are highly relevant to the query, while
they diﬀer in meaning versus the correct responses.

evance.7 To obtain multiple counterfactuals, we perform
several bipartite matchings. To ensure that the negatives are
diverse, during each iteration we replace the similarity term
with the maximum similarity between a candidate response
r j and all responses currently assigned to qi.

Ensuring dataset integrity To guarantee that there is
no question/answer overlap between the training and test
sets, we split our full dataset (by movie) into 11 folds. We
match the answers and rationales invidually for each fold.
Two folds are pulled aside for validation and testing.

5. Recognition to Cognition Networks

We

introduce Recognition

to Cognition Net-
works (R2C), a new model for visual commonsense
reasoning. To perform well on this task requires a deep un-
derstanding of language, vision, and the world. For exam-
ple, in Figure 5, answering ‘Why is [person4
] pointing
at [person1
requires multiple inference steps.
First, we ground the meaning of the query and each
response, which involves referring to the image for the

] ?’

6We ﬁnetune Prel (BERT), on the annotated data (taking steps to avoid
data leakage), whereas Psim (ESIM+ELMo) is trained on entailment and
paraphrase data - details in appendix Sec C.

7We tuned this hyperparameter by asking crowd workers to answer
multiple-choice questions at several thresholds, and chose the value for
which human performance is above 90% - details in appendix Sec C.

Figure 5: High-level overview of our model, R2C. We break the challenge of Visual Commonsense Reasoning into three
components: grounding the query and response, contextualizing the response within the context of the query and the entire
image, and performing additional reasoning steps on top of this rich representation.

two people. Second, we contextualize the meaning of the
query, response, and image together. This step includes
resolving the referent ‘he,’ and why one might be pointing
in a diner. Third, we reason about the interplay of rele-
vant image regions, the query, and the response.
In this
example, the model must determine the social dynamics
between [person1
] . We for-
mulate our model as three high-level stages: grounding,
contextualization, and reasoning, and use standard neural
building blocks to implement each component.

] and [person4

In more detail, recall that a model is given an image, a
set of objects o, a query q, and a set of responses r(i) (of
which exactly one is correct). The query q and response
choices r(i) are all expressed in terms of a mixture of natural
language and pointing to image regions: notation-wise, we
will represent the object tagged by a word w as ow. If w isn’t
a detection tag, ow refers to the entire image boundary. Our
model will then consider each response r separately, using
the following three components:

Grounding The grounding module will learn a joint
image-language representation for each token in a se-
quence. Because both the query and the response contain
a mixture of tags and natural language words, we apply the
same grounding module for each (allowing it to share pa-
rameters). At the core of our grounding module is a bidi-
rectional LSTM [34] which at each position is passed as
input a word representation for wi, as well as visual features
for owi . We use a CNN to learn object-level features: the
visual representation for each region o is Roi-Aligned from
its bounding region [63, 29]. To additionally encode infor-
mation about the object’s class label `o, we project an em-
bedding of `o (along with the object’s visual features) into
a shared hidden representation. Let the output of the LSTM
over all positions be r, for the response and q for the query.

Contextualization Given a grounded representation of
the query and response, we use attention mechanisms to
contextualize these sentences with respect to each other and
the image context. For each position i in the response, we
will deﬁne the attended query representation as ˆqi using the

following equation:

↵i, j = softmax

j

(riWq j)

ˆqi = X

↵i, jq j.

(2)

j

To contextualize an answer with the image, including im-
plicitly relevant objects that have not been picked up from
the grounding stage, we perform another bilinear attention
between the response r and each object o’s image features.
Let the result of the object attention be ˆoi.

Reasoning Last, we allow the model to reason over the
response, attended query and objects. We accomplish this
using a bidirectional LSTM that is given as context ˆqi, ri,
and ˆoi for each position i. For better gradient ﬂow through
the network, we concatenate the output of the reasoning
LSTM along with the question and answer representations
for each timestep: the resulting sequence is max-pooled and
passed through a multilayer perceptron, which predicts a
logit for the query-response compatibility.

Neural architecture and training details For our im-
age features, we use ResNet50 [30]. To obtain strong rep-
resentations for language, we used BERT representations
[15]. BERT is applied over the entire question and answer
choice, and we extract a feature vector from the second-to-
last layer for each word. We train R2C by minimizing the
multi-class cross entropy between the prediction for each
response r(i), and the gold label. See the appendix (Sec E)
for detailed training information and hyperparameters.8

6. Results

In this section, we evaluate the performance of various
models on VCR. Recall that our main evaluation mode is
the staged setting (Q→AR). Here, a model must choose the
right answer for a question (given four answer choices), and
then choose the right rationale for that question and answer
(given four rationale choices). If it gets either the answer
or the rationale wrong, the entire prediction will be wrong.
This holistic task decomposes into two sub-tasks wherein
we can train individual models: question answering (Q→A)

Table 1: Experimental results on VCR. VQA mod-
els struggle on both question-answering (Q → A) as
well as answer justiﬁcation (Q → AR), possibly due
to the complex language and diversity of examples in
the dataset. While language-only models perform well,
our model R2C obtains a signiﬁcant performance boost.
Still, all models underperform human accuracy at
this
task. For more up-to-date results, see the leaderboard at
visualcommonsense.com/leaderboard.

as well as answer justiﬁcation (QA→R). Thus, in addition
to reporting combined Q→AR performance, we will also
report Q→A and QA→R.

Task setup A model is presented with a query q, and
four response choices r(i). Like our model, we train the
baselines using multi-class cross entropy between the set of
responses and the label. Each model is trained separately
for question answering and answer justiﬁcation.9

6.1. Baselines

We compare our R2C to several strong language and vi-

sion baselines.

Text-only baselines We evaluate the level of visual
reasoning needed for the dataset by also evaluating purely
text-only models. For each model, we represent q and r(i)
as streams of tokens, with the detection tags replaced by
the object name (e.g. chair5 → chair). To minimize the
discrepancy between our task and pretrained models, we re-
place person detection tags with gender-neutral names.
a. BERT [15]: BERT is a recently released NLP model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks.
b. BERT (response only) We use the same BERT model,
however, during ﬁne-tuning and testing the model is only
given the response choices r(i).
c. ESIM+ELMo [10]: ESIM is another high perform-
ing model for sentence-pair classiﬁcation tasks, particularly
when used with ELMo embeddings [57].

9We follow the standard train, val and test splits.

Table 2: Ablations for R2C, over the validation set. ‘No
query’ tests the importance of integrating the query dur-
ing contextualization; removing this reduces Q→AR perfor-
mance by 20%. In ‘no reasoning’, the LSTM in the reason-
ing stage is removed; this hurts performance by roughly 1%.
Removing the visual features during grounding, or using
GloVe embeddings rather than BERT, lowers performance
signiﬁcantly, by 10% and 25% respectively.

d. LSTM+ELMo: Here an LSTM with ELMo embed-
dings is used to score responses r(i).

VQA Baselines Additionally we compare our ap-
proach to models developed on the VQA dataset [5]. All
models use the same visual backbone as R2C (ResNet 50)
as well as text representations (GloVe; [56]) that match the
original implementations.
e. RevisitedVQA [38]: This model takes as input a query,
response, and image features for the entire image, and
passes the result through a multilayer perceptron, which has
to classify ‘yes’ or ‘no’.10
f. Bottom-up and Top-down attention (BottomUpTop-
Down) [4]: This model attends over region proposals given
by an object detector. To adapt to VCR, we pass this model
object regions referenced by the query and response.
g. Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear Attention (MLB)
[42]: This model uses Hadamard products to merge the vi-
sion and language representations given by a query and each
region in the image.
h. Multimodal Tucker Fusion (MUTAN) [6]: This model
expresses joint vision-language context in terms of a tensor
decomposition, allowing for more expressivity.

We note that BottomUpTopDown, MLB, and MUTAN
all treat VQA as a multilabel classiﬁcation over the top 1000
answers [4, 50]. Because VCR is highly diverse (Supp A),
for these models we represent each response r(i) using a
GRU [11].11 The output logit for response i is given by
the dot product between the ﬁnal hidden state of the GRU
encoding r(i), and the ﬁnal representation from the model.
Human performance We asked ﬁve diﬀerent workers
on Amazon Mechanical Turk to answer 200 dataset ques-
tions from the test set. A diﬀerent set of ﬁve workers were
asked to choose rationales for those questions and answers.
Predictions were combined using a majority vote.

10For VQA, the model is trained by sampling positive or negative an-
swers for a given question; for our dataset, we simply use the result of the
perceptron (for response r(i)) as the i-th logit.

6.2. Results and Ablations

We present our results in Table 1. Of note, standard VQA
models struggle on our task. The best model, in terms of
Q→AR accuracy, is MLB, with 17.2% accuracy. Deep text-
only models perform much better: most notably, BERT [15]
obtains 35.0% accuracy. One possible justiﬁcation for this
gap in performance is a bottlenecking eﬀect: whereas VQA
models are often built around multilabel classiﬁcation of the
top 1000 answers, VCR requires reasoning over two (often

long) text spans. Our model, R2C obtains an additional
boost over BERT by 9% accuracy, reaching a ﬁnal perfor-
mance of 44%. Still, this ﬁgure is nowhere near human
performance: 85% on the staged task, so there is signiﬁcant
headroom remaining.

Ablations We evaluated our model under several abla-
tions to determine which components are most important.
Removing the query representation (and query-response
contextualization entirely) results in a drop of 21.6% ac-

76726

curacy points in terms of Q → AR performance. Interest-
ingly, this setting allows it to leverage its image represen-
tation more heavily: the text based response-only models
(BERT response only, and LSTM+ELMo) perform barely
better than chance. Taking the reasoning module lowers
performance by 1.9%, which suggests that it is beneﬁcial,
but not critical for performance. The model suﬀers most
when using GloVe representations instead of BERT: a loss
of 24%. This suggests that strong textual representations
are crucial to VCR performance.

Qualitative results Last, we present qualitative exam-
ples in Figure 6. R2C works well for many images: for in-
stance, in the ﬁrst row, it correctly infers that a bank robbery
is happening. Moreover, it picks the right rationale: even
though all of the options have something to do with ‘banks’
and ‘robbery,’ only c) makes sense. Similarly, analyzing
the examples for which R2C chooses the right answer but
the wrong rationale allows us to gain more insight into its
understanding of the world. In the third row, the model in-
correctly believes there is a crib while assigning less proba-
bility mass on the correct rationale - that [person2
] is
] ’s children, which is
being shown a photo of [person4
why [person2

] might say how cute they are.

7. Related Work

Question Answering Visual Question Answering [5]
was one of the ﬁrst large-scale datasets that framed visual
understanding as a QA task, with questions about COCO
images [49] typically answered with a short phrase. This
line of work also includes ‘pointing’ questions [45, 93] and
templated questions with open ended answers [86]. Re-
cent datasets also focus on knowledge-base style content
[80, 83]. On the other hand, the answers in VCR are en-
tire sentences, and the knowledge required by our dataset is
largely background knowledge about how the world works.
Recent work also includes movie or TV-clip based QA
[75, 51, 46].
In these settings, a model is given a video
clip, often alongside additional language context such as
subtitles, a movie script, or a plot summary.12 In contrast,
VCR features no extra language context besides the ques-
tion. Moreover, the use of explicit detection tags means
that there is no need to perform person identiﬁcation [66] or
linkage with subtitles.

An orthogonal line of work has been on referring expres-
sions: asking to what image region a natural language sen-
tence refers to [60, 52, 65, 87, 88, 59, 36, 33]. We explicitly
avoid referring expression-style questions by using indexed
detection tags (like [person1

] ).

Last, some work focuses on commonsense phenomena,
such as ‘what if’ and ‘why’ questions [79, 58]. However,

the space of commonsense inferences is often limited by
the underlying dataset chosen (synthetic [79] or COCO [58]
scenes). In our work, we ask commonsense questions in the
context of rich images from movies.

Explainability AI models are often right, but for ques-
tionable or vague reasons [7]. This has motivated work in
having models provide explanations for their behavior, in
the form of a natural language sentence [31, 9, 41] or an
attention map [32, 35, 37]. Our rationales combine the best
of both of these approaches, as they involve both natural
language text as well as references to image regions. Addi-
tionally, while it is hard to evaluate the quality of generated
model explanations, choosing the right rationale in VCR is
a multiple choice task, making evaluation straightforward.
Commonsense Reasoning Our task uniﬁes work in-
volving reasoning about commonsense phenomena, such as
physics [54, 84], social interactions [2, 77, 12, 27], proce-
dure understanding [91, 3] and predicting what might hap-
pen next in a video [74, 17, 92, 78, 18, 64, 85].

Adversarial Datasets Past work has proposed the idea
of creating adversarial datasets, whether by balancing the
dataset with respect to priors [25, 28, 62] or switching them
at test time [1]. Most relevant to our dataset construc-
tion methodology is the idea of Adversarial Filtering [89].13
Correct answers are human-written, while wrong answers
are chosen from a pool of machine-generated text that is fur-
ther validated by humans. However, the correct and wrong
answers come from fundamentally diﬀerent sources, which
raises the concern that models can cheat by performing au-
thorship identiﬁcation rather than reasoning over the image.
In contrast, in Adversarial Matching, the wrong choices
come from the exact same distribution as the right choices,
and no human validation is needed.

8. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Visual Commonsense Rea-
soning, along with a large dataset VCR for the task that
was built using Adversarial Matching. We presented R2C,
a model for this task, but the challenge – of cognition-level
visual undertanding – is far from solved.
